The author finds that food, whether vegetable or animal, increases the amount of uric acid in urine, and that there is no direct relationship between acidity and uric acid levels. Additionally, the study shows that sulphuric acid, sulphur, and sulphates in food and medicine can increase the sulphates in urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
