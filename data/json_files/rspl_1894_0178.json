The results show that the velocity of movements decreases as they become more complex, and the difference between educated and uneducated individuals is more noticeable in more complex movements. Additionally, the study finds that the velocity of movements decreases with age, with the most significant impact observed in writing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Motor Control"}
