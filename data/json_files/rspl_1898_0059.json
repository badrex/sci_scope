They discover gland cells in the stomodaeum and the absence of the six ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments, suggesting a correlation between these findings and the presence of gland cells in the stomodaeum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
