They find that the tuberculo-opsonic power of the blood is low in strictly localized tuberculosis cases and fluctuates in cases associated with constitutional disturbance, suggesting potential applications in diagnosing tubercular infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
