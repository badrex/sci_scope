They use a tuning fork, a Helmholtz wind siren, and blue light to create interference patterns and capture the vibrations on photographic plates. Their findings demonstrate the existence of difference and summation tones and provide insight into the complex interactions between sound waves and light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Vibrations"}
