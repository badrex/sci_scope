He observes that some nebulae produce a continuous spectrum, while others display one, two, or three bright lines. Huggins also attempts to determine the intrinsic intensity of the light emitted by some gaseous nebulae, suggesting that they may be the hottest objects in the category of nebulae and clusters.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
