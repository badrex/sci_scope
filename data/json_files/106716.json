The experiments reveal that the air produced is of a higher quality than common air and even better than air produced by plants in similar experiments. The author also describes the process of using algebraic characters to determine the goodness of the air and the precautions taken during the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Analysis & Reaction"}
