The method involves comparing the star's light to a standard candle and accounting for atmospheric absorption. The study provides a means to calculate the total quantity of light from stars and planets, with implications for understanding the overall illumination of the night sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
