Wollaston, investigates the arrangement of spherical particles in crystallography and proposes a theory based on the mutual attraction of spheres. He demonstrates how different crystal forms, such as tetrahedra, octahedra, and cubes, can be derived from the arrangement of spheres and how these findings can explain the origin of certain crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry"}
