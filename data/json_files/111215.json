Airy, investigates the historical context and geographical circumstances of the eclipses of Agathocles, Thales, and Xerxes. He analyzes the lunar theory and its improvements, and discusses the possible locations of these historical events. Airy concludes that the eclipse of Thales occurred in B.C. 585, May 28, and the total eclipse of the moon in B.C. 479, March 14, might have been the phenomenon that Xerxes encountered during his invasion of Greece.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Eclipse & Celestial Mechanics"}
