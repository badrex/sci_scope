Halley, experiments with the evaporation of water at different temperatures and estimates the amount of water vapor raised from the sea by solar heat. He calculates that the Mediterranean Sea loses 5280 million tons of water vapor in a summer day, which is more than the amount contributed by rivers flowing into the sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
