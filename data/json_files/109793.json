C. Brodie's experiments on dogs reveal that the nervous system plays a significant role in controlling stomach secretions, particularly in cases of arsenic poisoning. Dividing the nerves of the eighth pair and the accompanying sympathetic nerves in the neck resulted in a suppression of fluid evacuations from the stomach and intestines, suggesting a strong connection between nerve function and secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
