The collimator's principles rely on the invariability of a floating body's figure and weight on the surface of a fluid and the optical refraction properties of telescopes. The author demonstrates the accuracy and advantages of the floating collimator over traditional methods, paving the way for more precise astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomical Instrumentation & Techniques"}
