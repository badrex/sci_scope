The study reveals the close relationship between the Compound eye and the Compound Ocellus, and the evolution of these eyes from a common, rudimentary ancestor. The author also explains the role of the Dioptron and Neuron in the functioning of arthropod eyes and discusses the development of the Compound eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
