The most striking spectrum is neon's, which contains predominantly orange and red lines. Krypton and xenon have two spectra, one obtained with a direct discharge and another with a Leyden jar and spark gap, both more complex than the first spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
