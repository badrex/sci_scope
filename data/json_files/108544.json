Using a galvanometer, the author finds evidence of electric states between bile and blood, suggesting that these effects may be due to decomposition, catalytic actions, or thermo-electric actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
