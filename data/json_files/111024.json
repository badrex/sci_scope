The study involves the use of an ellipsoid of moments and the properties of cones and curves of double flexure, leading to the discovery of a new representative curve of elliptic functions of the first order.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mechanics"}
