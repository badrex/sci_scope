Jaques Paul Babin, describes his observations of the Euripus Strait's irregular tidal behavior and its relation to moon phases. He notes that the Moon is the primary cause of the odd flux and reflux, with regularity lasting for 20 days of each moon phase, and irregularity for 10 days. The author also compares the Euripus Strait's behavior to that of the Ocean at Bordeaux and Venice.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrology"}
