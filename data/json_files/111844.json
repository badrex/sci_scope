B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann, investigate the reaction of sulphuric acid on nitriles and amides, specifically acetonitrile. They discover a new substance, methylo-tetra-sulphuric acid, which they propose as a potential new chemical compound. The research also includes the synthesis and properties of this new substance, as well as its potential applications in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Compounds"}
