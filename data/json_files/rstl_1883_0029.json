The study reveals that the tendency of water to form eddies increases with temperature, and the resistance encountered by a fluid in a pipe depends on the product of its viscosity and velocity, as well as the pipe's dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics"}
