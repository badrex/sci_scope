Clinants, which alter the length of a line in a given ratio and rotate it through a given angle, provide a geometrical representation for every algebraical result, reconciling analysis and geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
