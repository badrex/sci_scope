They find that the hydrogen flame in the safety-lamp can detect a quantity of benzoline vapour in air that is one thirty-sixth of the explosive proportion and one twentieth of the inflammable proportion. The benzoline flame shows a distinct cap when the amount of benzoline vapour is one ninth of that required for an explosive mixture and one fifth of that which will yield an inflammable mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Safety"}
