The experiments reveal that certain gases, such as carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, nitrous oxide, and olefiant gas, have varying absorption rates of heat, with some being more opaque to radiant heat than others.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
