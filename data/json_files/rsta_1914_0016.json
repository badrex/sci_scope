They test the resistance of fluids in pipes with varying dimensions and velocities, confirming the existence of similar motions and providing evidence for the applicability of the principle of dynamic similarity in fluid resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics"}
