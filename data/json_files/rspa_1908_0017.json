The results show that the charge on a positive ion is double that of a negative ion, indicating that one positive ion and two negative ions are produced when a molecule of air is ionized by X-rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
