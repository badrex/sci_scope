This condition is characterized by green patches on the oyster's mantle, engorged blood vessels, and masses of green-colored leucocytes in the heart. The presence of copper in these green leucocytes suggests a potential link between the metal and the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Ecology"}
