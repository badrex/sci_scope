The study reveals a difference in sex ratios between white and colored populations and between legitimate and illegitimate births, suggesting that heredity and extraneous factors, such as metabolic activity and environmental conditions, play a role in determining sex ratios.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Genetics & Demography"}
