Using the galvanoscopic frog, the author demonstrates that induced contraction is likely caused by an electric discharge during muscular contraction, despite previous difficulties in directly observing this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
