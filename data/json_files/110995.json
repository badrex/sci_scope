He credits the undeviating accuracy of the compasses to the careful placement of magnets and attention to detail in adjusting the compasses for local attraction and magnetic variation. Tudor also refutes the claim that adjustments made in northern latitudes are not correct when the ship is south of the equator, stating that he observed no difference in the Pluto's performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
