He investigates the principles of compound rotatory motion and calculates the angular velocity produced by the disturbing solar force on the spheroidal figure of the earth, as well as the quantity of annual precession and nutation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics"}
