He attributes these differences to variations in soil composition, particularly the presence of chalk and flint. Lhwyd also mentions the existence of a petrifying spring at Harwich and requests further information on its properties and the location of the fossil findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
