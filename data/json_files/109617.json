He investigates its solubility in various solvents, reactions with acids and alkalies, and the products formed through distillation. The study reveals that Guaiacum resin differs from other resins, balsams, gum-resins, gums, and extracts in several ways, leading the author to consider it as an 'extracto-resin'.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
