They demonstrate the importance of dissolved oxygen for the chemical change and the increase in the chemical action with a larger surface area of the silver. The battery has potential applications in electrochemistry and energy production.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Energy Storage"}
