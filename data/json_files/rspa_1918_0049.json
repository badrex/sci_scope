They describe the average features of these storms, including changes in the horizontal and vertical forces, and the direction of the magnetic force. They also discuss irregular fluctuations in the magnetic force and their relation to latitude and storm intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetosphere"}
