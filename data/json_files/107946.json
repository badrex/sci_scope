They find that the circulation remains vigorous even when factors such as resilience of the lungs and elasticity of the heart are eliminated, suggesting that these factors do not play a significant role in maintaining circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Circulatory System"}
