The instrument is useful for determining the relative radiating powers of different surfaces and the law of radiant heat diminishment. The author also discusses the limitations of previous methods using metallic reflectors and offers explanations for deviations from the expected behavior of radiant heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer"}
