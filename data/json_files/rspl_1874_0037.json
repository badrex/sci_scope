The paper also discusses the inverse problem of determining when linear differential equations of the second order are satisfied by irrational functions and applies these principles to solve dynamical problems in mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Analysis"}
