They discover that the radium emanation withstands various chemical reactions and can be extracted and condensed using liquid air. Additionally, they find that helium is produced from radium bromide and that the emanation from radium can also produce helium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry"}
