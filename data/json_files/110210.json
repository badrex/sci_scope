Sabine conducts experiments to determine the actual difference in the number of vibrations of the pendulum in air and highly rarefied air, confirming previous inferences and revealing a greater amount of retardation caused by air than previously computed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Experimental Physics & Measurement"}
