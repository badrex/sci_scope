Reade, presents a solution to the limitations of Huyghenian eye-pieces in refracting telescopes by introducing single achromatic lenses. These lenses, made by combining a crown-lens and a flint-lens, eliminate internal reflections and improve the overall performance of the telescope.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
