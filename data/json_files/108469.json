Grove, investigates the effect of surrounding gases on the heat generated by a voltaic current in a platinum wire. He finds that the heat generated varies depending on the surrounding gas, with hydrogen showing the least heat generation and oxygen showing the most. This phenomenon is attributed to the different properties of the surrounding gases, such as their specific heats, conducting powers for electricity, and the mobility of their particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Energy"}
