The study was conducted at various temperatures, and the results showed that the weight of the vapour drawn off agreed closely with the calculated vapour pressure. The findings contribute to our understanding of the thermodynamics of water evaporation and its impact on atmospheric science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Climatology"}
