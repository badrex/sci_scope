They find that while the removal of water vapor has a small effect on the velocities of positive ions, it significantly increases the velocities of negative ions by a factor ranging between 2 and 30.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
