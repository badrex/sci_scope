The study aims to determine the temperature of the calorimeter and improve the accuracy of temperature measurements. The author also addresses potential sources of error and their impact on the final values of temperature coefficients and specific heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
