He uses glass bubbles to observe how changes in atmospheric weight impact their buoyancy. The experiment supports the idea that the atmosphere is a heavy body pressing upon the Earth, confirming Boyle's teachings on atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
