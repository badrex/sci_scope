The method involves drawing certain right lines and moving rulers to describe a curve that represents the equation's roots. This method can be applied to equations of any dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mathematical Analysis & Calculus"}
