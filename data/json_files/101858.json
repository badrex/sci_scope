He demonstrates that the object-glass inverts the image, while the eye-glass and the other lenses do not contribute to the inversion or erection of the image. Molineux breaks down the telescope into two separate optical systems, clarifying the role of each lens in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
