When mixed together, they produce a fine carmine color without any noticeable fermentation or alteration. The first liquor is made by infusing dried red roses in rectified spirit of wine, while the second liquor is made by adding a few drops of acid or oil of sulfur to good spirit of wine. Mixing the two liquors results in a beautiful reddish color.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Synthesis & Compounds"}
