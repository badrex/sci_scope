The process involves using a mixture of chemicals, including aqua fortis, aqua regis, sal armoniack, and spirit of wine, to create colored waters that can be applied to the marble. The resulting colored picture can be seen on both sides of the stone when cut, and has been tested and verified by experienced craftsmen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Chemistry"}
