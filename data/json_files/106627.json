They describe the dissection and analysis of the patient's body, providing insights into the anatomy and pathology of the condition. The study reveals the enlargement of the sigmoid flexure and the inversion of the colon, which caused the intestinal obstruction and ultimately led to the child's death.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Surgery & Anatomy"}
