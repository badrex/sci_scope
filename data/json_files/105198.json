He discovers that these organisms are not plants but animals, with various polyps and tentacles that serve as hands and mouths for feeding and digestion. Ellis also describes the different types of corallines and their growth patterns, as well as the role of vesicles in their reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Ecology"}
