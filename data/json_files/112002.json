The study reveals that the intensity of the disturbing force is less at Port Kennedy, and discusses the periodical laws of disturbances, solar-diurnal variation, and the contrast between the geographical and magnetical directions of the magnetic needle in the Arctic region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
