A method is developed to determine the potential by transforming the boundary equation. The study reveals various shapes, including pear-shaped curves, soda-water bottle-like forms, and tennis-racquet shapes, with the rotation decreasing as the configuration changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics"}
