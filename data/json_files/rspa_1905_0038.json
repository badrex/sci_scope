A. Wilson's interpretation of the electric effect of rotating a dielectric in a magnetic field, emphasizing that the induced electromotive force is independent of the nature of the moving substance and is solely dependent on the motion and the magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
