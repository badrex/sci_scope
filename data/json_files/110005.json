The mean length of the seconds pendulum was found to be 39-026302 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, at a temperature of 70\u00b0 in vacuo and at sea level. The ellipticity of the Earth was calculated to be very nearly the mean deduced from the observations of Captain Kater in England and the French mathematicians.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
