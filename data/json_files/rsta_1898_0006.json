They discover that air and other gases become electrified when bubbled through water or solutions of salts, acids, and alkalies. The authors also develop and test electric filters to measure the electrification and diselectrification of air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
