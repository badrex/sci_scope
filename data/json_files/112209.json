The study also reveals that equatorial regions contain a higher percentage of saline matter due to evaporation and that the North Atlantic Ocean has more salt than the South Atlantic, likely due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Chemistry"}
