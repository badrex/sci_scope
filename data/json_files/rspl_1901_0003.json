The authors used prismatic cameras to capture the solar spectrum and identified various elements present in the solar corona. The study also discusses the origins of coronal rings and provides a table of wave-lengths and probable origins of the measured lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
