The study reveals that the height of the water at a given place increases nearly as the sine of the time, while the time increases as the arc. The findings have implications for navigation and the understanding of tidal dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
