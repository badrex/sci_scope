Contrary to Rathke's theories, the author finds that the subclavian artery arises from the ventral end of the third arch, while the common carotid artery is formed from the truncus arteriosus. This challenges the widely accepted understanding of the development of these arteries in birds and other vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
