They find that the Lorenz and Lorentz formula is not accurate when applied to large density changes from gas to liquid, and suggest that continuous changes of density from gas to liquid can be produced by experimenting with carbon dioxide at temperatures close to its critical point.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
