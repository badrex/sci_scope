They find that the algebraic sum of contact differences of potential in a galvanic cell is equal to the electromotive force of the cell, proving that each surface of separation produces its effect independently of any other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
