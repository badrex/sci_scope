The author also discusses the influence of friction and local elevation and depressions on the axis, suggesting that these factors are not likely to cause significant changes in the Earth's rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
