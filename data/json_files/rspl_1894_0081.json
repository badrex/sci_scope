They conduct experiments using a sheet-iron vat and a quadrant electrometer to test the effects of electrification on air, finding that air can be charged either positively or negatively and that the electrification remains consistent over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
