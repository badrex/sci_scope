Norman Lockyer, investigates unknown lines observed in the spectra of certain minerals and compares them to celestial bodies. He examines the spectra of various gases and minerals, including nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and argon, and identifies the wavelengths of the unknown lines. The study aims to understand the origins of these lines and their potential connection to celestial phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
