They discover that the addition of soap or milk can affect the scattering of the jet, and that the sensitivity to electricity is remarkable. The influence of vibration on capillary phenomena is also studied, with observations on the effects of overtones and consonant chords.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Acoustics"}
