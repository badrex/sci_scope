They use a plethysmograph to measure lung ventilation and determine that the decrease in oxygen content in the blood is likely due to the direct interference of chloroform with the oxygen transport function of red blood cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anesthesiology & Respiratory Therapy"}
