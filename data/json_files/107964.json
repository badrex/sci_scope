The fish's electricity also has chemical effects, such as evolving gas when in contact with solutions. However, the author finds no evidence of the fish's electricity being able to ignite or produce sparks through the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
