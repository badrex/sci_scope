They find that stimulation of one vagus nerve does not annul or prejudice the inhibitory powers of the other vagus nerve, unless the inhibitory apparatus has been recently under stimulation for some time. This challenges the previously accepted theory of the connection of the vagus nerves with a common intermediate apparatus and suggests that each vagus nerve abuts against a common nervous apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
