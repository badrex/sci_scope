The author finds that while there are some differences in body size and shape, the internal structures and organs are quite similar. The discovery of a female N. umbilicatus specimen supports the idea that these two species are distinct, despite their close evolutionary relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
