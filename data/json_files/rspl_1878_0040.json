He concludes that gun-cotton, due to its rapid combustion, is a more effective sound-producer than gunpowder, and suggests its use in fog signals for better communication in dense weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences"}
