They determine the energy of scattered R\u00f6ntgen radiation by comparing the intensity of the scattered radiation from a given radiator in a fixed plane and the distribution of the scattered radiation around the radiator.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
