They find that the amount of glucoside present in flax plants increases with germination, reaches a maximum at an early stage of growth, and then diminishes steadily, ultimately disappearing altogether.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
