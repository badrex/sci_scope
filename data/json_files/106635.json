He also recommends the method of determining longitude by observing the moon's transit over the meridian. The study uses a gridiron pendulum clock, a reflector, an eighteen-inch quadrant, and a transit instrument to make accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
