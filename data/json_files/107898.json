The observations were conducted by Fearon Fallows, Captain Ronald, and Mr. Johnson, and the results were compared to previous observations made in London by Captain Sabine. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Earth's figure and its compression.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
