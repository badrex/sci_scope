The research found that the resistance of the flame changes when a magnetic field is applied, and the induced electric force in the flame is much larger than expected. The results suggest that the effect of the magnetic field on the resistance of the flame can be represented as the sum of two terms, one proportional to the square of the field and the other proportional to the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
