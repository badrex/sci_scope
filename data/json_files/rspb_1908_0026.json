The research examines the distribution and amount of glycogen in various tissues and its relation to foetal growth and maternal diet. The findings suggest that glycogen plays a significant role in the development of the foetus and its absorbed from the placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
