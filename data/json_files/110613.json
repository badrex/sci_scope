Young, investigates the theory of surface curvature, specifically focusing on umbilical points. He clarifies the confusion surrounding Monge and Dupin's work and demonstrates that lines of curvature at an umbilical point extend in all directions. Young also introduces a new method for analyzing surface curvature and discusses the relationship between lines of curvature and the osculating sphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
