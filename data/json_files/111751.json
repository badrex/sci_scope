The authors find that the cooling effect experienced by the fluids varies with pressure and temperature, and they explore the relationship between heat generated and work spent in compressing gases. They also introduce an absolute scale of temperature based on reversible operations and propose an empirical formula for air pressure in terms of density and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
