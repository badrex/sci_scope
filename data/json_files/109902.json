He explores the similarities between blood globules and muscle fibers and suggests that the extrication of air during coagulation plays a significant role in the blood's tubular structure. This structure allows the blood to communicate with the circulation and become part of the animal's solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hematology & Blood Disorders"}
