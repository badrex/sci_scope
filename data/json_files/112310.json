Sylvester, presents a theorem relating to polar umbrae and their factorials. He defines polar umbrae as quantities that obey the polar law of sign and introduces the concepts of transverse and longitudinal factorials of polar umbrae matrices. The theorem states that the product of a longitudinal and a transverse factorial of the same polar umbrae matrix is identically zero. This theorem is used to obtain the resultant of a linear system of equations in its most perfect form.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory"}
