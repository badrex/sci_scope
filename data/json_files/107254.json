The table represents the mutual attractive forces of different salts and can be used to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions. The author also suggests improvements to the orthography and representation of chemical substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Analysis"}
