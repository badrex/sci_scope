He finds that alburnum from winter-felled trees is more durable than that from spring-felled trees, while the heartwood's durability may vary depending on the tree's growth and season of felling.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Forestry & Tree Biology"}
