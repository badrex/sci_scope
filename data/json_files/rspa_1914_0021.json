The research finds that hysteresis is likely within 5% the same at high speeds as at low speeds, and the shape of the hysteresis loop has been determined. The hysteresis in a hardened steel tube is only about one-eighth of the hysteresis in the same tube after annealing.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
