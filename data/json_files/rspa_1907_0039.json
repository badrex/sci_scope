Using mathematical equations and experiments, the author demonstrates that the formula derived from the data can accurately predict the range of various projectiles, from a 12-inch to a 0.303-inch projectile.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
