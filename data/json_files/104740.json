Stukeley, examines the causes of earthquakes and challenges the notion that they are primarily caused by subterranean vapors, explosions, and fires. He argues that the extent and lack of visible effects of earthquakes contradict this hypothesis and suggests that a deeper understanding of springs and fountain systems is necessary to comprehend the true causes of these natural phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Seismology"}
