The study reveals that the viscosity of gases is independent of pressure and that the states of gas and 'ultra gas' merge insensibly, allowing for the exaltation of either phenomenon depending on the conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Molecular Physics"}
