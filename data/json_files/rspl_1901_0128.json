The author discovers a beautiful crystalline structure with primary and secondary crystals, and observes similarities between the structure of platinum and gold. The study also highlights the allotriomorphic nature of the micro-crystalline structure and its resemblance to the crystalline structure of gold and silver.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
