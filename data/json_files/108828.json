Walker, investigates earth-currents and magnetic calms using telegraph lines and a custom-built galvanometer. He discovers that these currents are not detected by the ordinary telegraph galvanometer and that they have a specific direction and value. The study provides insights into the earth's magnetic field and its activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
