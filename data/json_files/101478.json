The hydrostatical paradoxes include concepts such as the pressure of fluids, buoyancy, and the lateral pressure of fluids on immersed objects. The observations on muscles and glands focus on the structure and function of muscles, particularly the heart, and the discovery of the salivary duct and other vessels and glands in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
