The authors describe their experiments using a nerve-muscle galvanoscope and a capillary electrometer to analyze the fish's response to stimulation. They found that a single mechanical or electrical stimulus could evoke a single shock, while a series of shocks were observed during struggles or when the fish was lifted out of the water. The authors also examined the time-relations and characteristics of the reflex response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
