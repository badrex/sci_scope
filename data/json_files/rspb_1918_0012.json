The study aims to determine if the efficiency of wood as a water-conducting tissue can be quantified and if there is a correlation between water-conductivity and plant characteristics such as deciduous or evergreen habits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Botany"}
