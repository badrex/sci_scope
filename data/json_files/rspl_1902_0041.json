The research found that plants exposed to higher levels of carbon dioxide had stunted growth, smaller leaves, and altered stomatal behavior. The study also observed differences in the vascular and mechanical tissues of the plants, with the control plants having better-developed collenchyma and pericyclic sclerenchyma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
