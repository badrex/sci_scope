Sch\u00e4fer, discusses the presence of ganglion cells in the anterior roots of the cat's spinal nerves. These cells are found in most longitudinal sections of the anterior roots, particularly in the lower dorsal and lumbar nerves. The cells resemble those in the spinal ganglion on sensory roots, but their connection with nerve fibers remains unclear. The existence of these cells does not seem to be related to the phenomenon of sensibility in the root, known as'recurrent sensation.'", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
