They discover that silicon tetrachloride produces a nitride of silicon, while titanium tetrachloride does not show any spectrum attributable to a nitride. The study provides insights into the chemical behavior of these compounds and their interactions with active nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
