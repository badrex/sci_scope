The study reveals sexual dimorphism in the antennae, with the male's right antenna having a hypertrophied condition and a prehensile organ composed of 25 segments. The paper also discusses the crustacean's locomotion and the muscles that move the complex antenna apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
