Triewald, investigates the cohesion of matter, particularly between lead balls, and suggests that the strong attraction between the particles of matter is responsible for this phenomenon. He also explores the role of heat and its effect on the cohesion of materials, such as splitting stones using fat substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
