They compute the actual perturbations of a specific part of the stream over one revolution, taking into account the influence of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Their findings provide a better understanding of the meteor shower's behavior and help improve future predictions of its occurrence.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics"}
