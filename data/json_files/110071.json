He used a magnetized cylindrical bar to measure the magnetic intensity at different stations on the ship and compared it to the terrestrial intensity. The results showed that the iron in the ships affected the compass readings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
