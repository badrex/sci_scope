It measures the cord-delay in different reflexes and finds that the time taken is longer in crossed reflexes compared to same-side reflexes. The results suggest that there is one synapse in the conductive path for same-side reflexes and two synapses for crossed reflexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
