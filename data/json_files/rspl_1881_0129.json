By controlling variables such as air-tightness and gas-air mixture, the author demonstrates the significant role of coal-dust in the propagation of flames in coal mines. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding and mitigating the risks associated with coal-dust explosions for mine safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mining & Mineral Resources"}
