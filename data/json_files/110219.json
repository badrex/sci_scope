He suggests that a large tract of land near the Antarctic Circle could be the source of these icebergs, carried by prevailing winds, currents, and waves. The author also speculates that a powerful, rare event like an earthquake or volcano may have caused the recent increase in iceberg sightings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Glaciology"}
