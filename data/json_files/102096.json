He also observes that the crystalline humor is highly transparent, allowing light to pass through in straight lines. The author provides a detailed description of the structure and compares it to a tennis ball wrapped with a fine cord, representing the complexity and transparency of the eye's crystalline humor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
