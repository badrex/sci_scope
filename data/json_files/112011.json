The results show that girders of ordinary construction are not safe when subjected to violent disturbances equivalent to one-third the weight that would break them, but they exhibit great resilience when subjected to one-fourth the load.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil Engineering & Infrastructure"}
