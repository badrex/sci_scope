By observing the resistance of copper wires and iron samples, the temperature at which iron ceases to be magnetizable is determined. The study also examines the heat liberated during the recalescence process and the temperature coefficient of electrical resistance in iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Heat Treatment"}
