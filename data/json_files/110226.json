Kater's method. He investigates the impact of various factors, such as deviations in knife-edges and positions of axes, on the accuracy of the measurements. The study uses an example pendulum by Mr. Bailey and discusses the case where agate planes vibrate on a fixed knife-edge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Mechanics"}
