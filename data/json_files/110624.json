The instrument consists of a brass float, a water-filled case, and a spirit lamp to maintain a constant temperature. The float's level is maintained by adjusting weights, and the atmospheric pressure is indicated by the required weights to maintain the level.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
