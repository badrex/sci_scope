He argues that Hadley's theory, which considers the inertial and frictional effects of the Earth's rotation, is a substantial foundation for understanding the grand currents of atmospheric circulation. The author also presents his own theory, which builds upon Hadley's work and explains the behavior of winds in middle and higher latitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
