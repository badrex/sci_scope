The experiments reveal that the current increases rapidly with the potential difference up to a certain value, after which the increase is more gradual until another critical value is reached, when a further increase in the potential causes a rapid increase in the current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
