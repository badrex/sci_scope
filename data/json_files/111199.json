These compounds are formed by the union of alcohol radicals with various metals and exhibit powerful electro-positive characters. The author describes their formation, properties, and reactions, and suggests that these compounds can be used for various transformations in organic compounds and the production of new series of organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organometallic & Inorganic Chemistry"}
