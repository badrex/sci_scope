The study aimed to examine the spectrum of the inner corona immediately before and after totality and search for carbon bands during totality. The observations suggest that the carbon vapor, if present, was not intense enough to make an appreciable impression on the retina. The study also includes a note on the microscopic structure of rock specimens from three peaks in the Caucasus.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
