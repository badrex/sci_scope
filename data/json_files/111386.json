Through a series of experiments, he determines the equivalent of silicic acid using various carbonates and hydrates. He also synthesizes sodium silicate and discusses the possibility of multiple equivalents for silicic acid based on the presence of water and the nature of the base.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
