The study suggests that these characteristics are not exclusive to the mammalian class and can be found in some reptiles, indicating a possible correlation with food and environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Evolutionary Biology"}
