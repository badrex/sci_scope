The wax is found to be insoluble in water, but dissolves in alcohol and ether. It can be used in candles and has a melting point of 206\u00b0F. Further experiments reveal that the wax can be altered by exposure to light, acids, and alkalis, but its properties remain largely unchanged.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Chemistry & Polymer Science"}
