The instrument uses a direct-vision prism and a small achromatic telescope, allowing for the observation of bright lines from various elements. Huggins also discusses potential uses of the telescope during a solar eclipse and its possible applications in secret communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Observational Astronomy"}
