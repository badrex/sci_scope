He finds that the variation is more significant in the horizontal needle and concludes that the daily change is not produced by a general deflection of the directive power of the earth but by an increase and decrease of attraction from a specific point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields"}
