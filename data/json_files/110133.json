Faraday, investigates the existence of a limit to vaporization and the role of temperature and gravity in the process. He demonstrates that a limit exists where gravity counteracts the elastic force of a vapor, making it fixed. Faraday also discusses the role of homogeneous attraction in overcoming vapor elasticity and provides examples of experiments supporting his findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
