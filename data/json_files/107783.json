They find that birds convert a portion of the oxygen in the air into carbon dioxide gas during respiration, similar to humans. The volume of gas remains constant, but the proportions of gases change as the bird breathes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Comparative Physiology"}
