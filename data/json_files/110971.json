He examines the relationship between nervous influence and the passage of the electric current according to its direction, and the role of the electrical lobe of the brain in controlling the electric discharge. Additionally, he explores the relation between the intensity of the electric current and the physiological effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
