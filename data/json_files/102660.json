Through observation and analysis, the author concludes that such distortions and coalescence can be caused by external pressures on the womb or placenta, as well as the division of original vessels in the embryo. These findings challenge the notion that such monstrosities are the result of a mixture of different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
