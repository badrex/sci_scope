He argues that the demonstration is not conclusive and that the theorem is only true in certain cases, such as when the exponent of the law of attraction is positive and not less than unity.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics"}
