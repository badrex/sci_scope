The study explores the role of centrosomes, spindle fibers, and the behavior of chromosomes during cell division, suggesting that cell force is of a 'dual' character similar to electrostatic force or magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Genetics"}
