The research reveals a complex relationship between these coalfields, with differences in their geological history and floral composition. The findings suggest that local variations in the distribution of flora during the Carboniferous period played a significant role in shaping these coalfields.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Stratigraphy"}
