This apparatus, consisting of alternating metal and non-metal conductors, produces continuous and spontaneous electrical effects, paving the way for further research in electrochemistry and the development of modern batteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Energy Storage"}
