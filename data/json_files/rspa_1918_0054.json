They discover that the heat generation varies depending on the heat treatment and quenching process, and that an empirical law can approximate the gradual diminution of heat evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
