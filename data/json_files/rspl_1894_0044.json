They found that the primary cause of death is not heart failure but the arrest of respiratory movements. Death can be prevented by artificial respiration, except under specific circumstances. The study also confirms that the respiratory center is the first to be affected by changes in intra-cranial tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurology & Neurosurgery"}
