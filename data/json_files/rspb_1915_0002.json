The results show that while carbon dioxide administration may cause a decrease in output, adrenaline significantly increases coronary flow. The combined effect of both substances also leads to a marked increase in coronary flow, suggesting a complex interaction between these factors in the heart's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular System"}
