The study suggests that the presence of a gaseous atmosphere can affect the number of ions collected by the positive electrode through mechanical interference and direct combination of electrons with gas molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
