The method involves estimating pressures at the two ends of the capillary tube and measuring the quantity of gas passing through it. The results can be applied to other volatile substances like iodine, phosphorus, and sulfur.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
