The Dissected Battery consists of ten glass cells, allowing for the connection and comparison of various voltaic phenomena, and offers a clearer understanding of the underlying principles of voltaic combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrolytes"}
