Hauksbee, demonstrates an experiment where a drop of oil of oranges moves between two glass planes when they are pressed together. The drop's motion is influenced by the proximity of the glass planes and the angle of elevation. The experiment confirms previous findings on the ascent of water in tubes and between contiguous planes, and it shows that air pressure has no effect on this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry"}
