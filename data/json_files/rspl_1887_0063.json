They find that stretching by lateral tension occurs beneath ocean basins, while folding affects continental areas, particularly along coastlines with rapid slopes and high earthquake and volcanic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodynamics & Tectonics"}
