Regnault's claims. He explains his reasons for not pursuing additional decimal figures and expresses gratitude for Regnault's confirmation of his adopted number. Joule and Thomson's ongoing research on thermal effects of rushing elastic fluids is also mentioned.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
