He finds that the mean quantity of the solar force affecting the moon's gravity towards the Earth is more imprecise than initially thought, but concludes that the theory is close to the observed values of the Sun's mean horizontal parallax.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics"}
