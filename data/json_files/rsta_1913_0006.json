The authors find that the reaction rate increases with temperature, and they propose a formula to describe this relationship. The results provide insights into the temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
