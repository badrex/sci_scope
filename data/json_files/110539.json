Golding Bird investigates the electro-chemical effects of long-continued electric currents of low tension, using an apparatus similar to Professor Daniell's. He finds that various metals can be reduced and decomposed by these feeble currents, resulting in beautiful metallic crystals. The author also demonstrates the ability to form amalgams of potassium, sodium, and ammonium with mercury using this method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes"}
