The phenomenon is explained by the curvature of the water surface profile and the resulting tendency for water to flow from the center to the sides of the channel, creating a system of transverse currents that depress the filament of maximum velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Hydraulics"}
