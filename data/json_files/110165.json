He finds that errors in planetary masses, particularly Venus and Mars, and an incorrect moon mass contribute to these discrepancies. Airy provides corrections for the solar tables and discusses possible sources of remaining discrepancies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics"}
