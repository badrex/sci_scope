They find that the force is influenced by the tension of the residual gas and can be either normal or tangential to the surface, depending on the temperature differences within the gas and between the gas and solid surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
