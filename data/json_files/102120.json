The substance resembled a heart in shape but was flatter and contained a gritty substance in the septum cordis. The ox's lungs also contained cysts with fluid-filled matter. The unusual growths may have contributed to the ox's difficulty in breathing and movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
