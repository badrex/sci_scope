W. King investigates the function of the tricuspid valve in the right ventricle of the heart in humans and various mammals and birds. He demonstrates that the tricuspid valve serves as a safety valve, allowing for the reflux of blood into the auricle during varying states of distension. The degree of this function varies among different animal orders, with humans exhibiting a very conspicuous manifestation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular System"}
