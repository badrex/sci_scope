He suggests a new design for the dipping needle that eliminates the need to invert its poles, allowing for more accurate and faster measurements. Additionally, this design allows for the simultaneous measurement of both the dip and the terrestrial magnetic intensity, reducing the need for additional observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
