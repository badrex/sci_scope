The research reveals that connecting threads are present in young tissues and play a crucial role in the passage of materials between cells. The threads are also found in the phloem and xylem, with their abundance suggesting their importance in conducting food material and facilitating cell-to-cell communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
