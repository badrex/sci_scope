The device relies on the principle that the surface of liquids, when free from external causes, will be in a horizontal plane. This invention aims to prevent shipwrecks and loss of cargo due to inaccurate observations in unfavorable weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Science"}
