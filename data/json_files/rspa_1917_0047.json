The motion of air in cyclones is not symmetrical with regard to a center, and the circular appearance of cyclones on weather maps is due to their traveling with a speed similar to the velocity of the wind.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
