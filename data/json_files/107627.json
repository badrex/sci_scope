He discovers that imperfect conducting fluids do not give polarity to steel when electricity is passed through them, and that voltaic current in air is affected by the magnet. Additionally, he finds that the conducting power of metallic bodies varies with temperature, decreasing as the temperature increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
