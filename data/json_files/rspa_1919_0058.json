They discover that simultaneous dehydrogenation and hydrogenation can occur at temperatures near the hydrogenation range, suggesting a new mechanism involving an intermediate system of the organic compounds, nickel, and hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Catalysis"}
