They find that the fasciola cinerea is a continuation of the fascia dentata and is connected to the stria longitudinalis medialis, while the lateral stria belongs to the circumcallosal convolution. This research contributes to the understanding of brain structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
