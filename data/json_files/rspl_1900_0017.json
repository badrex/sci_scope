They find that the substitution of soda for potash significantly reduces the specific resistance of the glass, and that annealing increases the specific resistance. The study also reveals that the specific inductive capacity of glasses varies, with some showing dielectric polarization effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
