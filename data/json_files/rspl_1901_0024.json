The study compares the relative conductivities of gases, such as hydrogen, air, oxygen, carbonic acid, cyanogen, sulfur dioxide, chloroform, methyl iodide, and carbon tetrachloride, under various types of radiation. The results show that both deflectable and undeflectable rays give relative conductivities close to the relative densities, but Rontgen rays have significantly higher conductivities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
