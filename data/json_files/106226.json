He discovers that bees do not engage in true copulation and that their eggs are likely impregnated by males through a process similar to that of fish. Debraw's findings contradict earlier theories and provide new insights into the reproductive behavior of bees.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Behavior"}
