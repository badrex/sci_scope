Norman Lockyer and his team discovered a new gas obtained from uraninite through mineral distillation. They observed an important infra-red line in the spectrum with a wavelength of approximately 7065, which they found to be coincident with a chromospheric line. This finding expands the understanding of the new gas and its relation to chromospheric lines in the solar spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
