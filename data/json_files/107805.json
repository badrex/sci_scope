Experiments with different materials and colors are conducted, revealing that blue and indigo rays also have magnetizing properties, while large bodkins and neutralized watch springs do not. The author also explores the effect of blue glass in magnifying the magnetic effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
