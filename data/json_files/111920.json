They find that injecting acid into the circulation can cause a saccharine state in the urine, suggesting a perverted condition of liver processes. The unnatural state of the blood induced by the acid seems to promote the chemical change of amyloid substance into sugar.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
