By feeding larvae with different types of plant parts, the author demonstrates that the larvae's colors are largely due to modified chlorophyll derived from their food, supporting the theory that these pigments play a significant role in their coloration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Biology"}
