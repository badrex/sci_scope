They find that formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide are produced, and that the process can be replicated outside the plant by mimicking its essential mechanical, physical, and chemical arrangements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
