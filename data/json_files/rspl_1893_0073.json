The hypothesis explains why the outer parts of the retina are colorblind and why minimal stimuli from colored objects appear as shades of gray. The author also explores how the combination of red and green spectral rays produces the sensation of yellow and how certain pairs of spectral rays create gray or white sensations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Sensory Systems"}
