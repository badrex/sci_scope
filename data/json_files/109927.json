Davy explains that after sunset, the temperature drop on land is greater than on water due to water's expansibility at temperatures below 40\u00b0C. This difference in temperature leads to the formation of mist when cold, dry air from land mixes with warmer, damp air above water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
