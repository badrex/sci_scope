He proposes a hypothesis of a deficiency of matter below the mountain mass as a compensating factor and calculates the effects of this hypothesis on the deflection of the plumb-line at various stations along the Great Indian Arc.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
