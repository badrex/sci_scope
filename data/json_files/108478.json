The results show that large doses of liquor potassee can significantly decrease urine acidity, but do not render it constantly alkaline. Tartaric acid also affects urine acidity, with eighty-four grains causing pain in the bowels.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Metabolism"}
