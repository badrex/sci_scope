The results suggest that when the vacuum is near absolute, the action of heat transitions from attraction to repulsion. The findings challenge previous theories and contribute to the understanding of heat's influence on gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
