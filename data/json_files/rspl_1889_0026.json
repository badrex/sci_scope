The shells from the Aral Sea and its surrounding areas show variations in thickness, size, color, and internal rib structure, suggesting that these changes are correlated with the environmental conditions of the lakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Malacology & Shellfish Studies"}
