They find that the organ shock develops rapidly and that the response is more delayed and slower in development at low temperatures. The results support the view that only nerve endings in the organ are excitable structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurophysiology & Neuropharmacology"}
