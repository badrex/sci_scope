The author, William Hyde Wollaston, argues that the force should be measured by the magnitude of the body and the square of its velocity jointly, and distinguishes between vis motrix and momentum. He also compares the force of a body in motion to the force contained in a given quantity of gunpowder, emphasizing the importance of understanding the concept of mechanic force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Classical Mechanics & Newtonian Physics"}
