The study includes observations of the Great Nebula in Orion, Sirius, and other stars, as well as the Sun's red prominences. The findings suggest that the lines in the spectra of these celestial bodies are emitted by nitrogen and hydrogen, and that the observed alterations in the spectra indicate the relative motion between the Earth and these celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Spectroscopy"}
