The study reveals similarities between Pareiasaurus and other reptiles, such as Labyrinthodonts, Anomodonts, Procolophon, and Mammals, and suggests that Procolophon is a member of the Pareiasauria rather than a distinct sub-order.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
