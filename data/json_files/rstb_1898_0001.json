The researchers used the Marchi method to analyze the degeneration induced by these lesions and compared their findings with previous studies. The results provide insights into the organization and function of sensory tracts and centers in the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
