He explains that the movements in a cyclone are similar to the movement of a wheel rolling on the ground, and that the isobars in weather charts represent the paths of the air relatively to the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
