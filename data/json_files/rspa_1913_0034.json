They find that the velocity of electrons in dry air is significantly higher than that of surrounding molecules, and that the presence of water vapor affects the electron's motion and energy. The results provide insights into the behavior of electrons in various gas environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
