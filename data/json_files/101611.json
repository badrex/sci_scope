Battista Donius, discusses the unhealthiness of the Roman countryside and proposes solutions to restore its salubrity. He attributes the unhealthy conditions to southern winds, standing waters, low shores, inconsistent weather, and excessive heat. Donius suggests draining stagnant waters, draining the Pontine Lakes, planting pine trees, building houses on raised ground, and providing access to fresh water to improve the health of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental Restoration & Management"}
