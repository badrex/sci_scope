The study supports the meteoritic hypothesis, suggesting that celestial bodies are or have been swarms of meteorites, and discusses the implications of this hypothesis on the classification of stars and the evolution of celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Stellar Spectroscopy"}
