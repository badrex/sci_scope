By analyzing the temperature differences between the northern and southern hemispheres, the author provides insights into the effects of these inequalities on climate during geological periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Climate Science & Geophysics"}
