The results show a simple and consistent pattern of oscillation, with the magnet being attracted alternately to the east and west of its mean position. The study also highlights differences in the zero-points of the lunar variation at various stations, such as Pekin, the Cape of Good Hope, and St. Helena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
