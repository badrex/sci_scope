The animal's skeletal features, such as its jaw and eye structure, suggest it was a swimming creature. Its unique characteristics, which resemble both fish and other remote animal classes, make it an important link in the chain of evolutionary gradations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
