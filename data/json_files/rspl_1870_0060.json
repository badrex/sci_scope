Fritz exploring the connection between sunspots, auroral and magnetic disturbances, and planetary configurations. Fritz concludes that the planets' influence on sunspots follows a specific order and that changes in planetary magnetic axes may have a significant impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
