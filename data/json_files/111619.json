He presents his own theory, which suggests that the plasticity arises from a cycle of pressure, liquefaction, dispersion, and re-congelation, and argues against alternative theories proposed by Faraday, Tyndall, and Forbes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Cryosphere"}
