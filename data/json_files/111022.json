Stokes, discusses the practical applications of interference bands in spectroscopy, particularly for determining refractive indices, dispersion, and changes in light velocity. He also explains the appearance of certain bands in the secondary spectrum formed by two prisms and their relation to diffraction bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
