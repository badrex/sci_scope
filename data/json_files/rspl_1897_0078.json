The study reveals significant differences in brain size, shape, and convolutions, suggesting that these extinct lemurs had distinct neurological features and may have undergone'retrogressive evolution.'", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Evolutionary Biology"}
