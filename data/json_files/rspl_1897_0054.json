They study the variations in bacterial colonies' growth, shape, markings, and movements, and classify them into types based on their morphological and behavioral characteristics. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors affecting bacterial growth and the limitations of using macroscopic methods for species identification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
