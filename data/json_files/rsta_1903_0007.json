H. Darwin investigates the stability of the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium in a rotating mass of liquid using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis. He determines the energy lost in the process of concentration from a condition of infinite dispersion into the final configuration and provides a numerical calculation to prove the stability of the pear-shaped figure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics"}
