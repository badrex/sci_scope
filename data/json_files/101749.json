He conducts experiments to observe the effects of different liquids and their interactions with one another and with solid bodies. His findings contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics and surface tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
