The study reveals significant individual variation in the anatomical and physiological constitution of these fibers, leading to the recognition of a 'pre-axial' and 'post-axial' class of innervation for each muscle and movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
