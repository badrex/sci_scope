He argues that birds migrate due to changes in their reproductive organs and the need for a suitable climate for their offspring. He also notes that birds do not migrate due to temperature changes or food scarcity, and that winter birds of passage have a different migration pattern than spring birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ornithology & Bird Behavior"}
