These irregular motions occur at certain tidal conditions and can cause the river to temporarily flow in the opposite direction of the main tide. Wright explains the phenomenon's characteristics, such as its range and behavior at different tidal stages, and attributes the cause to the river's numerous windings and turnings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
