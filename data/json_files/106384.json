He conducts multiple experiments, showing that the wires shorten by a consistent proportion with each discharge of the battery. The phenomenon is not observed when the wire is heated to red-hot, suggesting that the shortening is due to the effect of electricity rather than heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
