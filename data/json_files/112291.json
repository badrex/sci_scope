The study reveals the presence of a dark-red spot in the cell wall and the formation of projections or pullulations on the surface of the corpuscles, suggesting a more complex structure than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
