The study proposes a method for analyzing these properties based on the Stokes expression for the terminal velocity of a small sphere in a viscous medium and introduces the concept of 'radion' to represent the average radius of an ion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Solution Theory"}
