The author, William Herschel, describes the challenges of viewing the satellites due to their distance and the need for a telescope with both magnifying power and the ability to penetrate space. He also discusses the advantages and inconveniences of using different telescopes and provides insights into the effective magnifying power of telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Satellite Studies"}
