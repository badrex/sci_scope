They find that the temperature of the positive pole of the electric arc is higher than previously believed and discuss the law of radiation and the ratio of emissive powers of bare and blackened platinum surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
