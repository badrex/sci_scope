W. Hofmann investigates a new series of homologous compounds to hydrocyanic acid, focusing on cyanide of ethyl and cyanide of amyl. He describes the synthesis and properties of these compounds, including their reactions with acids and alkalies, and predicts the formation of a new series of homologues of cyanogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
