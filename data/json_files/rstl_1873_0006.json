The new method of observing spectra allows for the examination of minute portions of the sun and its surrounding atmosphere, revealing the thickening of Fraunhofer lines in solar spots and the thinning in the chromosphere and prominences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
