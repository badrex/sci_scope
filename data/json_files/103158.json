Hauksbee investigates the relationship between the distance of a loadstone and the angle it creates with a needle. He finds that the proportions of the loadstone's power remain consistent at different distances, despite variations in the angle of the needle. This research contributes to the understanding of the magnetic field and the behavior of the loadstone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
