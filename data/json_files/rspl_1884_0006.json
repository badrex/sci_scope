The study reveals a close correlation between these properties and the Thomson effect, suggesting that the direction and magnitude of the effect depend mainly on the specific heat, specific resistance, and coefficient of expansion of the metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Electromagnetism"}
