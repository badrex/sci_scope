The instrument is particularly useful for measuring the light output of gas lamps and can even detect the moon's rays. Ritchie's photometer differs from Leslie's in that it measures the equality of temperatures in the chambers rather than the temperature difference.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
