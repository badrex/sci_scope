Gore, F.R.S., developed a method to measure the relative amounts of voltaic energy in over 100 aqueous solutions of various substances using a voltaic balance and a sensitive galvanometer. The results are presented in a volta-tension series, ranking the substances based on their energy output.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Methods"}
