The study also suggests that the 'elastic spring' mechanism and extrinsic muscles may be structures subordinate to sound production, and not related to adjusting to varying hydrostatic pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ichthyology & Fish Biology"}
