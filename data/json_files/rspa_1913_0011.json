They compare the dynamical method with the statical method and find that while the dynamical method may not be as accurate, it has the advantage of not requiring precise adjustments of the beam's cross-section or angle of incidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
