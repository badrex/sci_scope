The synthesis process involves treating monamines with bisulphide of carbon, followed by the action of heat and conversion into sulphuretted ureas and mustard oils. The author also discusses the physical and chemical properties of these compounds, as well as their reactions with other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Compounds"}
