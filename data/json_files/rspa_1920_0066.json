They propose a method to determine the density of finely divided solids and discuss the effects of varying surface accessibility and liquid compressibility on the forces acting on interfacial films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry"}
