The method involves measuring extant allied races and applying the data to reconstruct the extinct race's stature, taking into account factors such as variability, standard deviations, and time and climate changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anthropology & Human Evolution"}
