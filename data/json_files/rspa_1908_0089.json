The results show that the relative intensities of the radiations do not follow the order of atomic weights, and that selective transmission occurs when the screen and radiator are of the same metal. The study also provides insights into the atomic weight of nickel and the transmission of radiation through different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic Physics & Nuclear Physics"}
