The phenomenon is explained by the unequal pressure on the feet of the cases due to the movement of the pendulums, which causes a small bearing or motion in the case and communicates the motion to the other clock.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Physics"}
