The experiments involve dissolving the minerals in nitric acid, filtering out insoluble residues, and boiling the solutions to remove helium. The results contribute to understanding geological time and the decay of radioactive materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geochronology"}
