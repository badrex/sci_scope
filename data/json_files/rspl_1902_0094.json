They find that there is no true shadow near the surface of the obstacle when the wave-length is small compared to the obstacle's size, and they discuss the conditions for shadow formation in this scenario.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Wave Phenomena"}
