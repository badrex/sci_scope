They determine the molecular weight of the hydrocarbon molecule C6H12 to be approximately 83,987, which supports the idea that hydrogen has an atomic weight slightly less than unity and carbon is 12.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
