The authors use an alternating stress machine and measure the fall of temperature to determine the rate of energy dissipation. The results show that the energy dissipated increases as the fourth power of the stress range, and that there is no significant cumulative change in the material's properties under the tested conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
