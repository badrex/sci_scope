The study examines the minor tremor and the main shock, discussing their time-scales, amplitudes, and velocities. The paper also includes subsidiary results and solutions for various cases, such as two-dimensional problems and simple-harmonic sources of disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Studies"}
