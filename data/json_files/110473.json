He finds that a new battery design with paper insulation between copper plates performs better than the traditional design with porcelain or glass insulation. He also determines that nitric acid produces the highest voltaic action, with less zinc being dissolved per plate compared to other acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Batteries"}
