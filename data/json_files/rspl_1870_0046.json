The study focuses on the distribution of weight and buoyancy in ships and the impact of factors such as steam propulsion, increased length, and concentrated weights. The findings reveal significant contrasts in strains between light and laden ships and provide insights into the design and construction of ships.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture"}
