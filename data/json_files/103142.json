He finds that fish can survive in water purged of air, but their activity is reduced. When the air is removed from the environment, fish become inactive, but recover when the air is reintroduced. This suggests that fish require a balance of air and water pressure for optimal survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Aquatic & Marine Biology"}
