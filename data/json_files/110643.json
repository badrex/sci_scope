Whewell, investigates the permanency of mean water and low water laws at Plymouth using a six-year observation period. The results show that the height of mean water is constant within two or three inches from year to year, with a semi-menstrual inequality of six or seven inches for each fortnight. The study also reveals the influence of lunar declination on mean water height and confirms the theoretical deduction that low and high water heights are affected by the moon's declination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
