The study reveals that the bright lines observed in the spectra are due to the volatilization of the compound of the metal with oxygen, and that the luminous vapour is the same as that produced by the exposure of the chlorides of the metals to the heat of the Bunsen gas-flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
