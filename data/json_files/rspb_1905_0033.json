The author proposes two main types of placentation: plicate and cumulate, based on the behavior of the trophoblast. The placental development in ungulates shows a closer connection to the Proboscidea, Sirenia, and Carnivora, while the hyracoidea's placenta has a different, cumulate type more similar to certain Insectivora.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
