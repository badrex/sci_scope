He suggests that when air strikes a loose card, it is reflected and rises, carrying the interposing atmosphere and excluding the surrounding air, which creates suction and lifts the card. This explanation is supported by the author's observation that the effect is more pronounced when the fixed card is larger than the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics"}
