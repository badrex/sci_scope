The hybrid larvae exhibit purely maternal characters, regardless of the cross direction, suggesting that the principle of Mendelian dominance governs the expression of traits in the offspring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Genetics"}
