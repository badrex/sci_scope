Norman Lockyer, studies the spectrum of sodium under new experimental conditions and finds that the vapor produced from the metal after slow distillation in a vacuum shows the red and green lines without any trace of the yellow line. This observation challenges existing theories and suggests further research in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
