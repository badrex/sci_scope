The formula considers the ship's form and includes constants that can be adjusted for different ship designs. The study also explores the effect of shallow water on wave-making resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Naval Architecture & Ship Design"}
