The results show that goitre can be experimentally produced by consuming suspended matter from goitre-producing water and that it can be cured by the administration of intestinal antiseptics, such as lactic ferments. The study also suggests that the agent responsible for goitre production is likely a living organism parasitic in the human intestine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Pathology"}
