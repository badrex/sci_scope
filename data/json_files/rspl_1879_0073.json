They find that the new determinations of the molecular weights are about half the former values, supporting the inference that the atoms of these metals, like mercury and cadmium, have similar molecular volumes in the gaseous state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Atomic Weights"}
