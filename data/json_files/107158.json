He uses various objects, such as pins, sealing wax globules, silver globules, and pitch, bee's wax, and brimstone globules, to test the limits of the telescope's capabilities. The experiments reveal that a telescope can show an object subtending an angle of 0\u00b0484 before it can be divided into quarters of its diameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Instrumentation"}
