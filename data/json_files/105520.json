The method involves calculating the Moon's fall in one second, which is equal to the versed sine of the arc of the Moon's orbit described in the same time. The author also discusses the effect of the Earth's movement on the Moon's distance and the ratio of the Earth and Moon's masses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics"}
