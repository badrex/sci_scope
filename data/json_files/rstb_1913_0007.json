They conduct experiments on three different characters influenced by environmental factors and find that these effects can be passed on to offspring, demonstrating the role of the environment in inheritance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary & Developmental Biology"}
