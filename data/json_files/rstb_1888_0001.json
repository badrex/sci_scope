They used electrical excitation and ablation methods to investigate the effects of lesions on the brain and observed the animals' behavior and motor functions. The results showed that the anterior part of the frontal lobes did not have significant effects on motor functions or sensibility, while other regions played crucial roles in various brain functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
