The research reveals that the Sweet Coal Series belongs to the Middle Coal Measures, while the Sulphur Coal Series is part of the Transition Coal Measures. The findings contribute to understanding the geology and plant life of the Wyre Forest and its relationship to neighboring coal measure areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
