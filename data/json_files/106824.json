The observations were made at the Royal Observatory in Copenhagen using a six-foot transit instrument and a mural quadrant. The results contribute to refining the understanding of planetary orbits and their positions in the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Dynamics"}
