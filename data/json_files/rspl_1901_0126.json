The study confirms Nichols' value for the density of artificial ice but highlights that the Bunsen ice calorimeter's accuracy in absolute determinations is limited to about one in a thousand due to varying ice densities from the same water sample.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
