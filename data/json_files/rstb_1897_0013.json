The fungus forms a dense mycelial cushion that penetrates into the wood, and after several months, develops small hymenophores with typical basidia and basidiospores. The study provides insights into the anatomy and development of this wood-decaying fungus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Myecology & Plant Pathology"}
