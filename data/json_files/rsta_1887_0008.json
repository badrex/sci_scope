The study suggests that the stretching and probable fracture of the strata at some depth below the surface can lead to the injection of lower rocks among the upper ones, aligning with observed geological phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
