He discovers that the force of the cellular substance in timber is strong enough to cause rifts or clefts in trees and suggests that this force is responsible for the movement of sap in living trees.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Forestry & Wood Science"}
