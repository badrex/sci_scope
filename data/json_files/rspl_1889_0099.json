By increasing the water's surface area, the density of the oil film required can be measured, revealing that the thickness of the oil film needed to stop the camphor movements lies between one and two millionths of a millimeter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloids"}
