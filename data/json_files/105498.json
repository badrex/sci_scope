He also experiments with the conversion of snowfall to water, finding that new fallen snow with moderate wind and freezing temperatures produces a quantity of water equal to 1/10th of its bulk.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
