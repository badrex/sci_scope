After examining Carey's condition, physicians and surgeons decided to treat him with a mercurial course. The treatment seemed to have some positive effects, but the ossified parts were not reduced. The patient was advised to bathe in the ocean and anoint his limbs with the soapy juice of the quercus marina. The outcome of this treatment will be reported in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Medical Case Studies & Practice"}
