The study also reveals that nitrite-treated blood retains the ability to react with guaiacum paper and peroxide of hydrogen, suggesting that the nitrite compounds formed with oxidized hemoglobin are not fully expelled from the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
