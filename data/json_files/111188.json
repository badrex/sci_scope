Wharton Jones examines the veins in the bat's wing and ears, discovering that the veins in the ears lack valves and do not exhibit rhythmic contractility, unlike those in the wings. This finding contrasts with his previous research on the wing veins and provides insight into the unique circulatory systems of bats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
