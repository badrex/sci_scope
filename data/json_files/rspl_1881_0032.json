By projecting a magnified image of the drops and tracing their outlines, the author discovers the relationship between the maximum depth of the drop and the size of the tube it hangs from, as well as the effect of tube diameter on drop formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloids"}
