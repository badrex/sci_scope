They conduct experiments on monazite and thorianite, finding that about half of the helium content is released at a red heat. The results provide insight into the way helium is retained within minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Mineralogy"}
