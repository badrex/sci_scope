The Zululand strain is monomorphic, while the Uganda strain is dimorphic, with both long and stumpy forms present. This distinction has implications for understanding the distribution and characteristics of the disease caused by these parasites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Infectious Diseases"}
