The author discovers that the afferent fibers responsible for the reflex originate within specific muscles and that the spinal center is located in the lumbar segments of the cord. The study also explores the effects of various methods of disrupting the conductivity of the posterior root on the knee-jerk reflex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
