The study reveals that the average radium content of sedimentary deposits does not differ significantly from that of igneous rocks, and that certain accessory minerals, such as zircon, sphene, perovskite, and apatite, are rich in radium.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Mineralogy"}
