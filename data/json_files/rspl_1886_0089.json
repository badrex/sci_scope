They establish that the platinum wire thermometer is applicable and accurate for high-temperature measurements, with a temperature coefficient of resistance that remains constant even after exposure to high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
