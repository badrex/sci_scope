These insects, which are the larvae of the Scarabaeus arboreus vulgaris major beetle, cause significant damage to the roots of grass and crops, leading to the deterioration of meadows and fields. The author discusses various methods to control the population of these insects, such as using long poles to beat them off trees and burning them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Behavior"}
