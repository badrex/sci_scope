The research establishes a relationship between the configuration of the hexose and the enzyme, suggesting that they combine in an intimate manner. The findings contribute to the understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions and the factors affecting enzyme activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
