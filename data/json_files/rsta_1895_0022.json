They also explore the influence of various substances on the reaction rate and present a mathematical equation to describe the relationship between the conditions of a chemical change and its amount.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
