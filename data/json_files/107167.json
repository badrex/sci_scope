He observes that the compass readings vary when the ship's head is in different directions, and suggests methods to correct or allow for these differences in order to improve the accuracy of bearings and charting.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
