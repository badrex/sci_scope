They use a modified Lorenz apparatus with two discs and four magnetizing coils to minimize the effect of the Earth's magnetic field. The method is tested with resistances of 0.001, 0.002, and 0.01 ohms, showing satisfactory agreement with the International ohm standard.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Fields"}
