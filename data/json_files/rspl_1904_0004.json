The study focuses on stress and strain distribution in the cross-section of a beam, with results showing that the maximum lateral strain per unit of added load is greater on the compressive side at higher loads.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
