The author conducts an experiment using tinted photographic paper, asking observers to categorize the tints under different schemes of classification. The results show that the terms used for classification do not determine discrete classes, and there is a tendency for observers to assign the same name to both tints on a card. This has implications for the use of statistical methods in social and biological sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences & Humanities", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Statistics & Methodology"}
