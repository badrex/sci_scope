The research reveals a tendency for the first sacral vertebra to be liberated from the sacrum and a greater responsibility for the first sacral vertebra in supporting the ilium. The study also highlights inherent variability in the sacrum's position and a greater tendency towards elongation than contraction of the vertebral column.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
