This process converts the methyl group in the ammonia fragment to the benzol nucleus, resulting in toluidine formation. The author also discusses potential applications and further research directions in the field of aromatic compounds and their derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Aromatic Compounds"}
