E. H. Tutton proposes using wave-length rulings as defining lines on standards of length, such as the Imperial Standard Yard, to improve measurement accuracy. He describes a new type of defining mark called a 'Tutton location signal' and suggests its potential use in determining the number of wave-lengths of red cadmium light contained in the British yard.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metrology & Measurement"}
