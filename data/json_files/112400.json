The process involves boiling the alcohol with the substance, distilling it, and repeating the process to obtain a separation of the alcohols. The authors also mention that the separation can be done using sodium dissolved in amylic alcohol.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
