The author also investigates discrepancies in the observed values and compares them to theoretical results, concluding that the theoretical pole of verticity does not coincide with the pole of convergence.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
