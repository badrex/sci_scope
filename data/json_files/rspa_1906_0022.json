The alloy exhibits striking magnetic properties despite not containing any of the traditional magnetic metals. The author explores the effects of thermal treatment and low temperatures on the alloy's magnetic properties, discovering that quenching the alloy from above its critical temperature can permanently destroy its magnetic quality, while immersing it in liquid air can increase its magnetic susceptibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
