He finds a slightly different coefficient of increase of elasticity of air compared to Regnault's findings and concludes that a properly graduated mercurial thermometer can accurately denote the true temperature even at the freezing point of mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
