They find specific areas responsible for controlling inspiration, expiration, respiratory rhythm, cardio-inhibition, and blood pressure changes. Their findings provide a map of the neural control of these functions within the medulla oblongata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
