They also explore the opsonic power of blood in relation to the Staphylococcus pyogenes and the Bacillus of Plague, demonstrating the importance of opsonins in the immune response to bacterial infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
