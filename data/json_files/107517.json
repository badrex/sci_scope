He concludes that the heat communicated by flame depends on its mass and that a current established from below upwards prevents explosions within cylinders. This research led to the development of safer mine lamps, which were successfully tested in coal mines near Newcastle.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Dynamics"}
