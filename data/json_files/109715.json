He also explores the properties of these substances and compares them to oxygen, finding that they share a close analogy. Davy proposes new names for oxymuriatic gas and its compounds to aid in scientific discussion and understanding.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds"}
