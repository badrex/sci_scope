The study finds that mechanical treatment does not affect the electrical properties of metals, while even small impurities significantly impact conductivity. The hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Materials Science"}
