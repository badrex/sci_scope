The ship was cambered, meaning its keel was curved, and the forepart of the ship was lifted using mechanical lifting devices and the efforts of 270 men. The weight of the ship was calculated to be 1576 tons, and the lifting operation was completed in approximately seven hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Engineering & Shipbuilding"}
