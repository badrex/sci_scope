He classifies atoms into four types and explains various phenomena, including vegetation, miasmata, and aroma of plants, through this theory. Exley claims that his principles encompass and unify many existing partial theories in physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
