He discusses the composition of these incrustations and suggests that the mineralizing process may be due to the motion and separation of particles in the original compound, potentially involving chemical affinity, electro-chemical attraction, and attraction of aggregation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
