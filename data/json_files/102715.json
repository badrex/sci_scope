By compressing air in a condensing engine and observing the effects on a water column, the author suggests that even a small force can cause air to require time to return to its original state.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
