They calculate the temperatures of planetary surfaces and determine the effective temperature of space. The study also examines the balance between radiation push and gravitational pull on small radiating bodies and the impact of Doppler's principle on their movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
