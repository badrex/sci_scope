He also introduces the term 'calorescence' to describe the phenomena of heating and incandescence caused by invisible rays. Tyndall demonstrates various experiments using the invisible radiation, such as igniting different materials and creating incandescent images.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
