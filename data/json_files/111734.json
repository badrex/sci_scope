He finds that both oils increase the number of red corpuscles in the blood, with cocoa-nut oil showing nearly as effective results as cod-liver oil. Thompson believes cocoa-nut oil may serve as a useful substitute for cod-liver oil in treating phthisis.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nutrition & Dietetics"}
