They find that the brain can fix considerable quantities of neosalvarsan, but it is unable to penetrate into the brain due to a peculiarity of the cerebral capillaries. This inability explains the lack of success in treating syphilitic lesions of the brain using salvarsan.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neuropharmacology"}
