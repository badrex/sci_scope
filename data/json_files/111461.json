Gosse identifies four distinct forms of cnidocytes and examines their structure, function, and the mechanism of their venomous discharge. He also discusses the potential venomous properties of the fluid within the cnidocytes and its effects on various organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
