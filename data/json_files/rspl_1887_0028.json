C. Frankland and Percy F. Frankland, investigate the presence of new micro-organisms in the atmosphere using a solid culture medium. They characterize these micro-organisms by growing them in various media, observing their appearances under a microscope, and describing the colonies they form. The authors hope that their findings will aid in understanding the physiological changes caused by specific micro-organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microbial Ecology"}
