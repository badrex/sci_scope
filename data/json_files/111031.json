The method allows for the resolution of equations with rational factors and provides solutions in series. The author also discusses the convergency and divergency of the series solutions and classifies equations into sets based on their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Differential Equations"}
