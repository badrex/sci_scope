They find that vegetative cultures from the male and female organs produce monoecious plants, suggesting that the cells of the haploid gametophytic phase retain the power to produce these plants. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the morphological relation and cell-lineage of the male and female shoots.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Evolution"}
