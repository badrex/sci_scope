They find that water vapour has a significant impact on the current passing through salt vapours, with the greatest conductivity observed when water vapour is being absorbed by the surrounding materials. The research also concludes that the ionization observed in salt vapours is mostly due to processes occurring within the vapours themselves, rather than surface effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
