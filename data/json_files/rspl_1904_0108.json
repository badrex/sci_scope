The experiments were conducted using a ballistic pendulum and various bullets, with results showing that air resistance is significant even at high speeds and can be approximated by an empirical formula.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
