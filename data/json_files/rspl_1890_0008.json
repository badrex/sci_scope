Various explanations for the rise in barometric pressure during thunderstorms are discussed, including ascensional air currents, local compression of air, and the condensation of vapor into raindrops.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
