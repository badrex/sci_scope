The study reveals significant differences in brain morphology between the subjects, with the idiots' brains showing simplified convolutions and arrested development. The findings suggest that these differences may be due to developmental changes occurring during fetal life and could have implications for understanding idiocy and mental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
