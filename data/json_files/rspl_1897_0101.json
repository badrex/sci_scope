They also find that nitric acid behaves as a metallic conductor with a negative temperature coefficient for high concentrations, and discuss the implications of their findings in relation to the ionic dissociation and hydrate theories of solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
