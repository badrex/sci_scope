They also propose a modified version of Darwin's Pangenesis Hypothesis, which accounts for phenomena of serial homology and symmetry and removes difficulties in the theory of natural selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary Biology & Genetics"}
