The study focuses on the relationship between the structure of these objects and their ability to test the defining power and separating power of an object-glass. The author also discusses the optimal techniques for illuminating and viewing these objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microscopy"}
