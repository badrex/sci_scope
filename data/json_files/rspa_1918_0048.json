They propose that a hydrogen molecule consists of two atoms with a single electron each, and discuss the implications of this finding on atomic stability and the magneton's role in chemical combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
