The study finds that the violet ray, despite being weaker in illuminating power, has the most significant influence on plant processes, suggesting a difference in the way light affects plants and animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
