They find that while both elements have a large number of lines, there is no definite correspondence in their spectra beyond a general resemblance to iron. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the wave-lengths of cobalt and nickel lines, with implications for understanding their chemical and physical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
