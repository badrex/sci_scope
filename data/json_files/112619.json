Alfred Wanklyn and Ernest T. Chapman, develop a more efficient method for preparing ethylamine by digesting equal volumes of iodide of ethyl, strong alcohol, and aqueous ammonia. They demonstrate that ammonia can partially expel ethylamine from its compounds, allowing for the isolation of pure ethylamine through a series of distillations and treatments with potash.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Synthesis"}
