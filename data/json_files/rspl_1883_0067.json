They employ a direct magnetometric method, which allows them to investigate the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of thin wires and thick bars of iron and steel under different magnetizing forces and longitudinal stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
