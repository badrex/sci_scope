The study aims to determine if these hydrocarbons exhibit absolute isomerism, which would mean they have the same chemical formula but different physical properties. The author concludes that examples of absolute isomerism do exist within this series of hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
