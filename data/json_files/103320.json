He finds discrepancies in the latitudes of certain stars, suggesting a change in the obliquity of the Ecliptic over time. Halley raises questions about the accuracy of ancient observations and the potential for stars to have their own motions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeodesy & Celestial Mechanics"}
