G. J. Hartley, present measurements of osmotic pressures in aqueous solutions of cane sugar, dextrose, galactose, and mannite. They describe a method to determine osmotic pressure by observing the rate of solvent movement and discuss the challenges of using copper ferrocyanide membranes, which can lead to underestimation of osmotic pressures due to leaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
