The child's eyes and ears resembled those of a monkey, and the absence of the brain was replaced by a congealed blood-like substance covered by a membrane. The author discusses the circulation of blood and the role of the medulla spinalis in the life of animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
