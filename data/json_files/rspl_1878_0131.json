The authors find that the turning points in the Kew declination-range curve generally occur before those in the Trevandrum curve. The oscillations of the Trevandrum curve are generally larger than those of the Kew curve, and they often follow rather than precede the corresponding oscillations in the Kew curve.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
