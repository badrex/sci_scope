He demonstrates that if an integral of one equation in the discussed system is found, and a specific numerical result is odd, an integral of the entire system can be found by solving a single first-order differential equation. If the numerical result is even, the original system can be reduced to a new system with fewer equations, allowing for further application of the same procedure.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Differential Equations & Analysis"}
