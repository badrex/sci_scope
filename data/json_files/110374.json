The results show that black materials have the highest heat absorption and odor absorption, while white materials have the lowest. The study also reveals that the loss of heat by radiation follows the same order as its absorption, with black materials having the highest radiation loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
