Cervus verticornis, characterized by its unique downward curved first tine, is placed in the division of deer with palmated antlers and is determined to be from the Pleiocene and early Pleistocene periods. Cervus savini, represented by several skulls and antlers, is considered the ancestral form of the extinct and living types of fallow deer and is found in early Pleistocene deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Evolutionary Biology"}
