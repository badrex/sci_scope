The study focuses on the Schonhorn glacier near the Simplon hospice, where the author measures the velocity of the glacier's movement and discusses the implications of these findings for the viscous theory of glacier motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Cryosphere"}
