He finds evidence that these circles were related to the May Year, a vegetation year that was prevalent across Europe in ancient times. The author identifies Arcturus as the star observed at these sites and estimates the approximate dates of their use based on the alignment of stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Archaeoastronomy & Cultural Astronomy"}
