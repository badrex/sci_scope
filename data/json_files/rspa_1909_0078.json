E. H. Tutton presents a wave-length comparator for comparing standards of length, such as the Imperial Standard Yard, with official or other copies in terms of wavelengths of light. The instrument is the first specifically designed as a wave-length comparator and is also the most perfect for measurement in wave-lengths in general. The comparator uses an interferometer with a Hilger constant deviation prism and can compare two standard bars by counting the number of interference bands that move past a reference spot during the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optical Physics & Metrology"}
