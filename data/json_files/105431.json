The coal also contains a light oil and a volatile acid salt, which are mixed with the water that distills from it. The author compares the properties of Bovey coal to those of other types of wood and charcoal, highlighting its unique characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials & Mineralogy"}
