This method is applied to the diurnal variation of magnetic declination and temperature at various locations, allowing for the mapping of oceanic temperatures and the creation of isothermal curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
