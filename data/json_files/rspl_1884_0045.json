They find that the sounds heard over the trachea and lungs differ significantly, with vesicular breathing being distinct in the inner lung and bronchial breathing in the outer lung. The study sheds light on the production and characteristics of respiratory sounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pulmonology & Respiratory Medicine"}
