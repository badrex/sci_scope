The study finds that the synthesis of neutral fat occurs in the intestinal villi before the lymph reaches the mesenteric lacteals, and that pancreatic extracts have a marked ability to release fatty acids from soap.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
