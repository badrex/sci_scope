The authors find well-marked solar and lunar diurnal variations in each month, with double oscillations and two maxima and minima during the 24 hours. The results show a relationship between the range of movement and the mean height of the water in the well.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Oceanography"}
