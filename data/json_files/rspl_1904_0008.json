The study demonstrates that the retrocalcarine sulcus is a distinct feature in the human brain and is present in various mammalian species, providing insights into the evolution of the cerebral cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
