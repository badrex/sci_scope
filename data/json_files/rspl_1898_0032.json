The results show that hysteresis increases with time and temperature, but at higher temperatures, a maximum value is reached, followed by a decrease in hysteresis with further heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
