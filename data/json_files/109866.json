He discovers that they reproduce both sexually and asexually, with hermaphroditic copulation and parthenogenesis. The leech lays eggs in capsules, which hatch after three weeks, and the young leeches emerge from the capsule after five more weeks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
