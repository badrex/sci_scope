The experiment involves measuring the space occupied by the expanding gas using water displacement. The results suggest that the space occupied by the gas is nearly equal to the bulk of 11 grains of gunpowder, indicating that the space deserted by the water is not supplied with real air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Explosives"}
