The energy required for this process is a small fraction of the photosynthetic energy produced daily, and the pumping action is difficult to demonstrate practically due to its feeble character and diffuseness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
