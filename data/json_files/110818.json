The paper also presents tables of results for the inclination of the needle, the declination and inclination of the needle, and the horizontal and total magnetic intensity at thirty-two stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
