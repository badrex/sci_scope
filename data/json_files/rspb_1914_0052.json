The researchers found that 53% of flies were infected with trypanosomes, with T. brucei being the most common species. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence infectivity for future research and disease control efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
