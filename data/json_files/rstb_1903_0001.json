The author examines the respiratory activity of various mammals, including reptiles, monotremes, marsupials, and higher mammals, and discusses the experimental methods used to measure CO2 production and temperature variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Developmental Biology"}
