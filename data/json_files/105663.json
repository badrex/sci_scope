The author investigates their diet and living conditions, noting their consumption of damaged wheat and pickled pork. The disease shares similarities with a French epidemic described in the 'Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences,' which was attributed to ergot, a substance found in rye. However, the affected family did not consume rye, leaving the cause of the disease uncertain.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Epidemiology & Infectious Diseases"}
