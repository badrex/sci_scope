He observes that the effect is greatest with slower rotations and that the presence of heat can influence the results. Babbage also examines the impact of various factors, such as screens and extraneous causes, on the observed phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
