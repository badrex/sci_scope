He also examines the mechanical effects of muscular contractions and compares them to the work calculated using the dynamical theory of heat. The study suggests that the electric current exciting a muscle does not represent the force exerted by the muscle, which is more likely due to chemical changes during contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
