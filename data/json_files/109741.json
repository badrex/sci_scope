He finds that the angles of these crystals differ, proving that their forms are not the same. This discovery challenges the previous classification of these minerals and suggests that their crystalline forms depend on their chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineral Chemistry"}
