He discusses the precession and nutation of a body undergoing shape changes and the impact of deformations on the position of the Earth's axis of symmetry. The study aims to answer questions raised by geologists and mathematicians regarding the Earth's polar axis and the potential influence of geological upheaval and subsidence on the Earth's rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodynamics & Geophysics"}
