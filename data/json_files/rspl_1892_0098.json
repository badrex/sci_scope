They find that peptone blood has a significantly lower number of leucocytes and that these cells likely dissolve in the plasma. Additionally, peptone plasma has unique properties, such as a heavy precipitate called nucleo-albumen and reduced CO2 levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
