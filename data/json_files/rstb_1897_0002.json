The study aims to determine the direct influence of the cerebellum on spinal centers and provide evidence for or against the idea that the cerebellum exerts a direct influence on spinal centers through descending tracts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
