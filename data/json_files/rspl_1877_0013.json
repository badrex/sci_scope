The research focuses on the form of the reflex action and its relationship to injuries of the sacral nerves and spinal cord. The findings reveal that the sphincter is in a continuous, slightly varying contraction state, which can be inhibited by irritation applied to the rectum. The study also explores the effects of various stimuli on the sphincter's reflex action and the duration of these events.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
