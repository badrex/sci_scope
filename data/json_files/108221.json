B. Airy, investigates the phenomenon of light polarization using a prism and mica, discovering that bands form when light is out of focus. He presents a theoretical explanation based on the wave theory of light, which involves the asymmetry of bands and the position of the bands in the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Electromagnetism"}
