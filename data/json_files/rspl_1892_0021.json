This test-case challenges the assumption that temperature of a solid or liquid is equal to its average kinetic energy per atom, which has been widely taught and used as a fundamental proposition in thermodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics"}
