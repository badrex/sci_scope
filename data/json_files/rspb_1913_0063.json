Strain A exhibits a higher number of short, aflagellar forms and posterior nuclear forms compared to strains B and C, leading to a reconsideration of the nomenclature and classification of these parasites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Microbiology"}
