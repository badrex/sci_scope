This phenomenon occurs when light is reflected from metallic surfaces and undergoes a physical change that is intermediate between completely polarized and unpolarized light. The author also finds that the angles of reflexion at which this type of light is restored to polarized light can be represented by the variable radius of an ellipse, hence the term 'elliptic polarization'.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
