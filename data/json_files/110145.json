He investigates the circulation of blood through the lungs using microscopes and injections, discovering that the structure of the air-cells is better suited for receiving supplies from the atmosphere and transmitting them to the heart. This challenges the existing theory that respiration simply decarbonates the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
