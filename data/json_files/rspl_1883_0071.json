The teeth resemble those of the Thylacoleo or Nototherium, and their dentinal structure shares similarities with the wombat. The author also discusses a fossil humerus from the Wellington Breccia Cave in New South Wales, which is the largest Monotreme discovered to date.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
