The study involves observing the vibrations of magnetic needles and comparing the results to determine if the intensity of the magnetic attraction is affected by changes in the Earth's distance from the sun or its declination with respect to the plane of the sun's equator. The author also discusses the discrepancies in the directive force of the opposite poles and the possible existence of electrical currents under and above the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
