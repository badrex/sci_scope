By analyzing the sensation curves of colour-blind individuals, the author concludes that the place of maximum luminosity travels in the case of red-blindness from Standard Scale No. 46 to 48, and in the case of green-blindness, from Standard Scale No. 52. This study helps in understanding the relationship between colour-blindness and the trichromatic theory of colour vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Sensory Systems"}
