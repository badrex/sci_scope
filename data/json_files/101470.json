The method involves two observers at different latitudes using telescopes and measuring rods to observe the Moon\\'s position among stars and its apparent diameter. Eclipse observations are also suggested for deducing the Sun\\'s distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
