They discuss three cases of inaccuracy in earlier calculations and present new methods for summing the harmonic series, focusing on reciprocals of even and odd numbers. The author also provides updated values for Euler's constant and related calculations to 110 decimal places.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Numerical Analysis & Approximation"}
