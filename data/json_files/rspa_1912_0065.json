The study highlights the importance of caution when interpreting changes in absorption spectra and suggests that the differences may be explained by the superposition of absorption curves rather than the formation of intermediate compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
