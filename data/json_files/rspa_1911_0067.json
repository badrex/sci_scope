The study investigates the relationship between the total radiation emitted, the density and strength of the gaseous mixtures, and the temperature of the gases. The results show that denser mixtures emit more radiation, and the intrinsic radiance depends on the reflecting power of the explosion vessel's interior surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
