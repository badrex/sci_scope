They find that streamers consist of charged metallic vapor, and the motion of the vapor is mainly due to the electric force of the spark. The streamers' appearances differ based on the metallic lines, and their differences are solely a question of the duration of the luminosity of the lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
