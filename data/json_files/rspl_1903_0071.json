Crookes corrects his previous paper on the spectrum of radium, identifying that a faint line previously attributed to radium was actually due to aluminum. He also discusses the inability of radium stimulation to elicit characteristic line spectra from bromine or radium molecules, and suggests further experiments on helium molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
