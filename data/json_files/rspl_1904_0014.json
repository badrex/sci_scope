They find that the number of chromosomes in the spore mother-cells is 32, and the reduction division follows the Mendelian hypothesis, providing evidence for the universal occurrence of a reduction division in plants and animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
