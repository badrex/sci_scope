The study assumes that stars are similar in size and brightness to the sun and concludes that their parallax would be too small to observe with current instruments, even for the brightest stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astro-Geodesy & Celestial Mechanics"}
