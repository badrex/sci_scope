He discovers that while lime can deepen the color produced by some astringents, it does not improve colorfastness and can even destroy the dyeing properties of logwood. Clegg also finds that the use of alkalis, such as pearl ashes, can produce deeper black colors, but excessive amounts can damage the colorfastness of the dyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Chemistry & Dyeing"}
