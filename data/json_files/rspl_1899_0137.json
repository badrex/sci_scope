The author compares the thermo-electric differences between free wires and wires subjected to longitudinal and lateral strain by drawing them through a draw-plate. The results provide insight into the relationship between strain and thermo-electric qualities in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solid State Physics & Materials Science"}
