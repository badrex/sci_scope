They find that the metallic and protometallic lines have similar relative intensities in both spectra, suggesting similar temperature and electrical conditions. However, the chromosphere spectrum has more prominent helium lines, indicating different temperature conditions for helium vapour and metallic vapour.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Stellar Spectroscopy"}
