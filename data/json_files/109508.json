Despite employing the electric fluid as a preferable agent, no decomposition of the muriatic acid was achieved, leading the author to conclude that the acid's basis might be an unknown body that requires more complex affinities for separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
