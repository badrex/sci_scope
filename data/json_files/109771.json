Due to unfavorable weather, only eight observations of the sun were obtained. The obliquity of the ecliptic at the late solstice was inferred to be 230\u00b0 27' 471.35\". The small discordance with the summer solstice could be resolved by modifying Bradley's refractions, but further observations are needed before making any corrections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
