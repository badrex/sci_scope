F. Baxter's experimental inquiry investigates whether signs of current electricity are present in plants during vegetation. Baxter's findings, combined with previous research by Becquerel and Wartmann, suggest that electric currents exist in the leaves and roots of plants, potentially related to vital or organic changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
