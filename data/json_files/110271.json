Lubbock extends his equations for determining planetary inequalities, including terms depending on the cubes of eccentricities and quantities of that order. He applies this to the great inequality of Jupiter and recommends using indices to designate the arguments of planetary disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics"}
