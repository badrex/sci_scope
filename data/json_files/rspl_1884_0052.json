This method allows for the identification, assessment of purity, and estimation of quantity of alkaloids in solutions. The study also reveals differences in absorption spectra based on molecular structure and chemical constitution of the alkaloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
