The author analyzes samples from two coal mines and concludes that black-damp is primarily composed of nitrogen, with lower levels of carbonic acid and methane. Inhaling black-damp causes respiratory distress and suffocation, highlighting the importance of proper mine ventilation and safety measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mining & Mineral Resources"}
