The instrument's principle is similar to those used by Daniell and Dalton, but it differs in the application of frigorific action directly to the thermometer's bulb. Jones addresses an objection to the design and mentions a similar construction in Vienna.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
