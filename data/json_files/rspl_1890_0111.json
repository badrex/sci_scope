Thompson, investigates the phenomena of galvano-hysteresis and their relationship to Villari's and Hughes' effects. He discovers that these phenomena are akin to the effects observed by Villari in 1865 and by Hughes using the induction balance. The author also finds that the effects can be imitated and reproduced using copper wires immersed in iron filings and surrounded by a magnetizing coil.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Phenomena"}
