The author observes that the permeability of iron increases rapidly as the temperature rises, eventually reaching a maximum and then decreasing as the material loses its magnetizability. The findings suggest that magnetic moments of iron molecules diminish with increasing temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics"}
