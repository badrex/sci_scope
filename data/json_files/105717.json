He conducts experiments with a balance to measure the resistance from friction and suggests that the quantity of friction in large engines may be estimated at 1/2 the weight or pressure on the rubbing parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Design"}
