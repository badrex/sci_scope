He observes that transparent liquid streams become visible when vapors or fluids mix, and opake deposits form on these streams, revealing the lines of junction of two fluid or gaseous surfaces. Addison applies these findings to explain numerous phenomena related to clouds, films, and membranous formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences"}
