He finds that blood corpuscles have the same appearance and form as other cells and are propagated by the division of their nuclei. This study supports the idea that blood corpuscles are a fundamental part of cell theory and contribute to the formation of different tissues and organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
