They observe that sap ascends in trees, and factors such as gravity, temperature, and tree age affect the bleeding process. The authors also discover that sap ascends through the wood itself and not just between the bark and the tree.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Ecology"}
