Higgins, investigates the reaction between tin-foil and a copper nitrate salt, resulting in ignition and detonation. The experiment involves immersing the salt in nitrous acid, then applying it to the tin-foil and coiling it up. The reaction produces heat, nitrous fumes, and an explosion, which Higgins explains through the properties of the copper salt and the heat generated by the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
