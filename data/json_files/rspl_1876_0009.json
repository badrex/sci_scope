They find that the selenium's conductivity increases significantly, and the conducting film is superficial and not removed by rubbing or dilute nitric acid. The film is highly likely not to consist of uncombined mercury, and the authors suggest a method to obtain bars of selenium with a given high resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Electrochemistry"}
