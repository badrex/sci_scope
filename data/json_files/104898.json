Despite attempts to treat the condition, it appears to be hereditary, as all six of his children also have the same rugged covering. The author suggests that if such a family were to be forgotten, they might be considered a different species of mankind, raising questions about the origins of other differences among humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Dermatology & Genetics"}
