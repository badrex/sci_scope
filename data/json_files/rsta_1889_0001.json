By considering the impacts of meteorites as a large-scale quasi-fluid pressure, the author investigates the mechanics of a swarm of meteorites, with a numerical application to the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeology & Planetary Science"}
