The study reveals that the energy in the spectrum is localized in the characteristic wavelengths of the metal of the anticathode, with the ratio of the intensity of the characteristic rays to the rest of the spectrum being nearly 1:1.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
