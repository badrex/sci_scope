He presents a series of propositions to calculate boiling points based on composition and demonstrates their accuracy through experimental data. The author also discusses the boiling points of isomers and the importance of considering chemical character in understanding boiling point differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Physical Chemistry"}
