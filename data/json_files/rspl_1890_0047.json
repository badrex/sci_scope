The experiments yield a result for the specific resistance of mercury at 0\u00b0C, with a probable error of +0.012. The author suggests that further improvements in apparatus and temperature control could lead to even more accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Optical Physics"}
