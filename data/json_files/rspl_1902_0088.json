They identify five types of characteristic noises produced by these disturbances and suggest that they are related to the interaction between electric stresses in the atmosphere and solar radiation-induced ionization. The author also proposes that these disturbances may be linked to diurnal variations in the Earth's magnetic field and the efficiency of wireless telegraphy at night.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
