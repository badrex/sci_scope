The research reveals that the sudden loss of magnetism occurs at the same temperature for all steels, suggesting that the eutectoid patches have a consistent composition and that this temperature is the true transition point.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Steel"}
