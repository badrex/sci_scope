They find that there are three types of thelytokous females, each producing different ratios of arrenotokous and thelytokous offspring, and conclude that external factors like temperature and nutrition do not solely determine the sex of the offspring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Development"}
