The authors find that the solubility of zinc in bismuth increases significantly with temperature, while the solubility of bismuth in zinc and the solubility of bismuth and zinc in tin also increase with temperature. The results indicate that the presence of tin enhances the solubility of the metals in the alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
