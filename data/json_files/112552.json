The process involves the use of nascent hydrogen to attack thiocompounds, resulting in the formation of menaphtylamine. The author also discusses the properties of menaphtylamine and its derivatives, as well as the potential for further research into sulfur compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
