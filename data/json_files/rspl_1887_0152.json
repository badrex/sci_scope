The author argues that the Ornithorhynchus teeth may have arisen independently in a relatively recent ancestor, challenging the notion that Monotremes retain many Sauropsida-like features due to degradation and reversion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary Biology & Genetics"}
