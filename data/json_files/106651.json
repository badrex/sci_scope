He proposes that glass can have its natural quantity of electric fluid increased or decreased to a certain extent, which is proportional to the surface area. The author also suggests that the discharge of a jar is a rapid succession of small quantities of electric fluid, rather than a single, large discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrostatics & Electromechanics"}
