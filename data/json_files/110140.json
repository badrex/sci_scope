The shell's design includes a cylindrical form with a conical apex, allowing it to explode upon impact. Successful tests were conducted at Kinsale Fort and Leith Fort, with some shells exploding at distances of up to 1200 yards.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Military & Defense Technology"}
