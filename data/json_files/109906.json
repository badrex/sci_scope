He observes that their kidneys are similar in structure and function, with a papilla in the ureter leading to a receptacle for urine. The urine is primarily composed of uric acid, which hardens upon exposure. Davy also notes differences in the urine composition of different species, such as the presence of carbonate and phosphate of lime in the alligator.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
