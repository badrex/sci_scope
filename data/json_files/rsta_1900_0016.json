They observe the formation of a bag or pocket of air below the surface and the flow of liquid along the walls of the air cylinder. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between a liquid and a falling object.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics"}
