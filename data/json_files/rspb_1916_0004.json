They find that certain salts, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, and magnesium chlorides, inhibit clot formation and have varying degrees of erosive action on the cholate gel. The addition of calcium salt to these salt solutions can also inhibit their erosive action, demonstrating the antagonistic action of salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Biophysics"}
