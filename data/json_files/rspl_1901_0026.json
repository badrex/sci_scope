The study covers various types of monstrosities, including union in the head region, pectoral region, and by the yolk-sac only, providing detailed descriptions of the cranial, visceral, and vertebral skeletons, as well as other anatomical structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
