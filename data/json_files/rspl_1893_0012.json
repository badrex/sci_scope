This submergence resulted in the formation of Rubble-drift and loess deposits, which contain the remains of land animals and shells. The author argues that these deposits provide evidence for the proposed hypothesis of a submergence and subsequent upheaval of the land.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
