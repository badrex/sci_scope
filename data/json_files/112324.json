The results showed that vibrations from trains could extend beyond the tunnel and that the amount of disturbance was influenced by factors such as train length and weight, as well as velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil Engineering & Infrastructure"}
