They verify that superposition of simultaneous forces is applicable to the phenomena of residual charge and confirm the relationship between residual charge and exciting charge. The study provides insights into the behavior of glass jars and their dielectric properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Dielectric Materials"}
