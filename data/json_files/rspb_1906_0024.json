The research aims to determine if there is a differentiation in type or variability between the population in a state of conjugation and the non-conjugating population. The results show that conjugants are significantly differentiated from non-conjugants in type and variability, with conjugants being shorter, narrower, and less variable in both length and breadth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Protistology"}
