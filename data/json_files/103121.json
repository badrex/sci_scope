He discusses the shape, mutability, and duration of these phenomena, and proposes that they may be caused by volcanic eruptions on the Sun. Derham also notes the transformation of spots into umbrae and then into faculae, and the relationship between these changes and solar activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Solar Activity"}
