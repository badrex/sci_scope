They also study the production of immunity to gastrotoxin and its impact on the development of stomach ulcers. The findings suggest that precipitins are mostly specific but have overlapping actions, and that immunity can be developed through repeated injections of inactive gastrotoxic serum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Pathology"}
