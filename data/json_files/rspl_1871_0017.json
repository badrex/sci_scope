Out of 132 substances tested, only 14 were dissolved by liquid cyanogen, demonstrating its low solvent power. Additionally, the author examines the reaction between iodine and fluoride of silver, producing a volatile and colorless liquid fluoride of iodine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
