Warren De La Rue and Hugo W. Muller investigate the electric discharge with the chloride of silver battery, measuring the striking distance and electromagnetic force between various electrode configurations. They find that the intensity of force per centimeter decreases continuously up to a certain point, after which it increases and becomes nearly constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
