They find that saturation of an immune serum with melanin can remove the opsonin and reduce phagocytosis, suggesting that opsonization and deopsonization are not strictly specific processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
