They observe that these inhibitions affect the origins of vagus fibers, the ends of vagus fibers that control respiration and heart movements, and the blood vessel regulation center in the medulla. This research sheds light on the complex interactions between the nervous and cardiovascular systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
