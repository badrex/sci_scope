The velocity of the current is influenced by the length and diameter of the tube, as well as the form of the tube. Temperature also plays a role in the movement of the air currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
