The author determines acidity using a standard solution of caustic soda, sugar content with Soleil's saccharometer, and alcohol levels with Geisler's alcoholometer. The results provide an order of acidity, sweetness, and strength for different types of wines, beers, and spirits, with implications for diet and health."}
