He discovers that the action of the spectrum is mainly confined to the region of luminous rays and that the effectiveness of these rays in destroying a given tint is often related to the complementary colour. Additionally, Herschel develops a new photographic process called Chrysotype, which uses ammonio-citrate of iron and ferro-sesquicyanuret of potassium to create a rapid and detailed image.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Spectroscopy"}
