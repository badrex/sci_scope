They discover the presence of a pigment similar to haemoglobin in Actinia mesembryanthemum and a chlorophyll-like spectrum in Bunodes ballii, Sagartia, and Anthea cereus. The study also reveals the presence of a green pigment similar to biliverdin and a new pigment in Sagartia species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
