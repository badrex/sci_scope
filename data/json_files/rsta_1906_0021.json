They also study the chemical statics and dynamics of reversible and irreversible systems under the influence of light, providing a detailed analysis of various cell configurations and their responses to different light sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
