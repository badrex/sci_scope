They observe that annealing is accompanied by a rearrangement of the metal's crystalline grains, and that the pattern seen after annealing resembles that of an unstrained specimen. The researchers also study the effects of heating the metal in different atmospheres and find that the process of recrystallization does not immediately affect the surface pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
