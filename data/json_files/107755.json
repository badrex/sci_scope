Pond, presents a table of annual variations in the positions of several fixed stars, comparing his own observations with those of Dr. Brinkley. The study aims to understand the irregularities in the stars' positions, such as the'southern deviation,' and contribute to the improvement of astronomical observation methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeodesy & Positional Astronomy"}
