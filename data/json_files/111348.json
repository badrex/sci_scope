P. Kirkman, presents a complete solution to the problem of k-partitions of a polygon and polyace. The solution involves the enumeration of partitions and their reversals, taking into account various distinctions and configurations. This work is essential for understanding the theory of polyedra and provides a method for finding the number of k-partitions of an r-gon when k and r are given numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Combinatorial Geometry"}
