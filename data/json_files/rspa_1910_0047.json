The theory suggests that the decay of luminosity is due to the destruction of active centers in the material, which are ionized and dissociated by alpha-particles. The intensity of scintillations decreases as the number of active centers is reduced, in agreement with experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Nuclear Physics"}
