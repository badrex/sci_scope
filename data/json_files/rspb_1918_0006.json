The study suggests that current antitoxin preparations may not fully protect against all types of B. tetani, highlighting the need for further research and development of more effective treatments for tetanus infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
