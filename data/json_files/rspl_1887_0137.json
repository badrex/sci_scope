The nephridial system in Perichaeta consists of a network of tubules, which is similar to the leech but with numerous nephridiopores in each segment. This supports the idea that the annelid excretory system can be derived from the platyhelminth excretory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
