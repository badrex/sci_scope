The study confirms that there are no significant differences between the senses of savage and civilized races. The Todas show a distinct deficiency in the color sense, particularly in distinguishing blue, and a high frequency of color-blindness. The research also explores the Todas' social and religious institutions, as well as their kinship system, marriage regulations, and inheritance laws.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anthropology & Human Evolution"}
