They find that sun-spot inequalities around 24 and 26 days have periods similar to terrestrial meteorological inequalities, with Toronto temperature-ranges exhibiting double oscillations and Kew temperature-ranges having a single oscillation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
