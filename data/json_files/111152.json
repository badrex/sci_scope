Brodhurst, examines the human iris, its structure, and its physiological functions. He concludes that the iris is an irritable membrane with involuntary motor power primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The iris plays a crucial role in the overall health and functioning of the human body, with its activity being influenced by the sympathetic system and opposed to spinal and cerebral influences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
