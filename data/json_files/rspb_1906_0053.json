The authors find that the'sweet' and 'bitter' cassava plants contain cyanogenic glycosides, which release toxic hydrocyanic acid when ingested. The research highlights the importance of understanding the chemistry of cassava plants for their safe consumption and use.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biochemistry & Physiology"}
