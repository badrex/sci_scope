The study reveals that the optimum temperature is independent of substrate and enzyme concentration, and that the enzyme's efficiency is affected by the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
