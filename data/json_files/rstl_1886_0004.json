They study the expansion of the liquid, compressibility, density of the vapor, and heat absorbed during the change of state from liquid to gas. Their findings contribute to understanding the behavior of alcohol under varying temperatures and pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
