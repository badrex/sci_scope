Herschel, examines the effects of crystallized bodies on homogeneous light and the causes of deviation from Newton's scale in the tints developed when exposed to polarized rays. He discovers that the axes of double refraction in crystals differ in position for different colored rays of the spectrum, leading to a new element in the formulae of double refraction and further supporting the theory of oscillations as a general physical law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
