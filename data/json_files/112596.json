They develop a powerful generator of dynamic electricity and demonstrate that an electro-magnet can accumulate and retain a charge of electricity, leading to the evolution of large amounts of dynamic electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Induction"}
