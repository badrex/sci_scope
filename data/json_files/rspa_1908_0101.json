They find that the refractive indices and relative path retardation of these gases are linear functions of their refractivity for infinite wavelengths, and discuss the accuracy and limitations of their measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
