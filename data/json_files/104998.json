He argues that fossil shells found near the surface do not necessarily indicate that the Earth was once covered in water, and that the presence of marine fossils in mountains does not prove that mountains were formed by sea currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
