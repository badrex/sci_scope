He discovers that the formation of a conducting sulfuret halts the chemical action, which in turn ceases the electric current. This finding supports the idea that the current is dependent on the chemical force present in the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Cells"}
