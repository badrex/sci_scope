The comet's spectrum contains bright lines, presumably of sodium vapor, and other bright lines or groups of lines. The continuous spectrum extends from below F to a little beyond H, and the author is unable to see the cyanogen group in the ultraviolet region.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
