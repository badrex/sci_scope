They analyze the average length, maximum, and minimum length of the trypanosome in different animal species and discuss the distribution of the trypanosome's length. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the classification and identification of African species of trypanosomes pathogenic to humans and domestic animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Pathogen Biology"}
