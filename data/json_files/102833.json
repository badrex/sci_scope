They find that the colon is mortified and rotten, with excrement leaking into the abdominal cavity. The obstruction is caused by a severe doubling of the colon, with the two surfaces adhering so firmly that they cannot be separated without tearing the exterior coat of the intestine.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Gastroenterology & Digestive System"}
