The results show that the agents can have varying effects on heart rate, rhythm, and force, with chloroform appearing to have a more depressing effect on the heart. The study also suggests that curves in the tracing may be a sign of morbid conditions and that narcosis and fatigue can lead to weakened heart force and arterial contractility.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Anesthesiology"}
