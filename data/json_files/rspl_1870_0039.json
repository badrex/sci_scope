Thomson to Prof. Frederick Guthrie", "topics": ["Hydrodynamics", "Vortex-Flow", "Fluid Pressure", "Vibration", "Tuning Forks"], "tldr": "In this letter, Prof. Sir W. Thomson discusses the relationship between fluid pressure and vibration, using experiments with tuning forks and cards. He explains that the average pressure at any point of a fluid is equal to a constant diminished by the product of the density into half the square of the velocity, which explains the attractions demonstrated in the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
