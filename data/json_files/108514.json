The authors discuss the structure and composition of these nodules, as well as the potential implications for understanding the flora of the coal formation period. The presence of Trigonocarpon, Halonia, Sigillaria, and other plant genera in these nodules provides valuable insights into the vegetation that contributed to the formation of coal.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Stratigraphy"}
