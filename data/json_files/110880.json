B. Daubeny investigates the effects of crop rotation and root excretions on the absorption of inorganic matter by plants. He finds that root excretions have a limited impact on crop growth, and that the availability of inorganic matter in the soil plays a more significant role in crop productivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Agronomy & Soil Science"}
