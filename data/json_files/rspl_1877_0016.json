A. Ewing, investigate the relationship between static and kinetic friction at low velocities. They find that in certain cases, the coefficient of friction increases as the velocity decreases, suggesting a continuity between the two types of friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
