Elliot conducted a magnetic survey of the Eastern Archipelago, observing magnetic lines, variations, and changes in declination and intensity of the Earth's magnetic force. The study involved 16 fixed stations across a vast area, and the results were compared with Singapore's magnetic observatory. The findings revealed that some stations agreed with Singapore's magnetic march, while others showed differences due to geographical position and seasonal changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
