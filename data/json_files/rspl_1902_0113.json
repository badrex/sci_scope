The device consists of iron wire bundles, magnetizing and demagnetizing coils, and a rotating commutator. This detector can be employed to compare the wave-making power of different radiators and investigate the transparency or opacity of various substances to Hertzian waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Waves"}
