They find that the rate of propagation is influenced by the capacity of the wire and the surrounding dielectric, and that the velocity of propagation does not depend on the specific resistance of the wire.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
