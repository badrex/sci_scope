The author demonstrates that the reflex is initiated by bilateral stimuli above the knee and that tail stimulation can inhibit the reflex, leading to an increased amplitude and frequency upon its return.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
