They study the transformation of s-trichloro- and s-tribromo-benzenediazonium hydroxides into hydroxybenzene derivatives, providing insights into the mechanisms of intramolecular change and the role of catalysts in these reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms"}
