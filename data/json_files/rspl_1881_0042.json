They find that most of the strong lines of these metals can be reversed by managing the atmosphere and supply of metal in the crucible. The results provide insights into the thermoelectric effects of stress and the behavior of metallic vapours under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
