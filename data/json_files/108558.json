The authors demonstrate that older bone tissue is removed in masses and replaced by new tissue, providing evidence for the first time that this process occurs throughout an individual's life. They also describe the differences between newly formed and older bone systems and the importance of lamination in bone tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
