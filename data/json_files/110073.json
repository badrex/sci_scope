The results showed a discrepancy with the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain, leading to a reevaluation of the earth's ellipticity and the parallel circle diameter. The longitude of Falmouth was determined to be 20\u00b011' of time, and that of the British Consul's garden at Funchal was 11\u00b07'39\" W of Greenwich.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
