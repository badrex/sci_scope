He describes the belts as appearing ochraceous, or similar to the color of some sand or \"red\" deal wood. He also notes that the outer borders of the equatorial bands are not parallel and that there is no similar tint on the moon or Mars. Phillips suggests that the colored extra-equatorial belts may be land seen between white clouds.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Atmospheres"}
