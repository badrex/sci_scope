The study suggests that while blood is indeed cooled during inspiration, it is also mixed, attenuated, and expanded during expiration, challenging the traditional view of the lungs' function.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Respiratory System"}
