The main theorem states that the generating function for the coefficients of a particular redundant function can be expressed as a function of the coaxial minors of the determinant of the given quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Combinatorics & Number Theory"}
