They find that no atmospheric lines are present in the moon's spectrum, and only a few elements' lines coincide with the solar spectrum in the planets. In the case of 40-50 fixed stars, they observe coincidences with the spectra of various terrestrial elements, suggesting the presence of these elements in the stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Stellar Composition"}
