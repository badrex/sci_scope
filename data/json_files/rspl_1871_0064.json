He demonstrates that these muscles are supplemental contrivances designed to produce maximum work, and that their unique geometry allows for efficient force transmission despite being surrounded by other structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
