They conclude that the grain or crystal of silver halide is the photochemical unit in the dry plate, and that the photochemical law of the silver halide grain is a crucial factor in understanding the photographic process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Materials Chemistry"}
