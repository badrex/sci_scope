The author demonstrates how the motion of a rigid body can be expressed in terms of six symmetrical angular velocities and discusses the implications of this finding for the study of kinematics and mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
