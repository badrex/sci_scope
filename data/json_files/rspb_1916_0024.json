They find that saline solutions are relatively ineffective due to reduced blood viscosity, and propose a modified solution with increased viscosity to improve arterial pressure restoration.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Circulatory System"}
