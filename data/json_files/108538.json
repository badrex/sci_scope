The results show that the moon's effect on barometric pressure is slightly greater at Singapore, located near the Equator, compared to St. Helena, which is farther away in terms of latitude.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
