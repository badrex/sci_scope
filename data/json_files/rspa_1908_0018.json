The experiments show that the glow's intensity varies with the velocity of rotation, and its position changes with the direction of rotation. The glow is also affected by a magnetic field, with the direction and intensity of the glow reversing when the magnetic pole or rotation direction is changed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
