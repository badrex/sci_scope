They identified specific regions responsible for controlling hind leg movements and walking, as well as the upper extremity of the ascending frontal convolution for more complex movements involving the arm and leg.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
