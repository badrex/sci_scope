He discusses the method of determining the north polar distance of the sun and the importance of the zenith point in the calculations. Additionally, Pond mentions the ongoing development of a zenith sector by Mr. Troughton, which may provide a more precise determination of the distance between the zenith and the pole.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
