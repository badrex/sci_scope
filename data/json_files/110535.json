William Ritchie, examines the discrepancy between the actual velocity of sound in air or vapor and the velocity predicted by theory. He critiques Laplace's hypothesis and proposes a new molecular theory, which he supports with experiments involving steam, air, hydrogen gas, and carbonic acid gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound Waves"}
