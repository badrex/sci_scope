W. Hofmann investigates various sources of aniline and discovers that commercial aniline contains a different base from normal aniline, which is essential for the production of aniline-red. He discusses the possibility of this base being an isomeric variety of aniline or a base analogous or homologous with aniline, and its potential impact on understanding the formation of rosaniline.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds"}
