The study focuses on the influence of jelly on ionic velocities and the effect of precipitation on the specific resistance and local potential-gradient. The results show that the specific ionic velocity of the barium ion traveling through a decinormal solution of barium chloride in solid agar jelly is approximately 0.98 cm per second.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
