He finds that tides are affected by local factors such as coast shape, distance traveled, and the meeting of tides from different directions. The study also reveals a diurnal difference in tide heights and the influence of coastal geography on tide hours and cotidal lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
