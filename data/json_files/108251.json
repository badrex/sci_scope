He demonstrates that these tissues are nourished by a nutrient fluid that exudes from the surrounding blood vessels and is circulated by the vital properties of the cells within these tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
