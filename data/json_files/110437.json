W. Fox investigates the electrical properties of metals and minerals, particularly the gray oxide of manganese, and its position on the electro-magnetic scale. He also explores the limitations of using a magnetic needle as an indicator of electricity transmission and proposes the hypothesis of pulsations to explain the phenomena. Additionally, he introduces a new galvanometer design for measuring deflecting forces of electrical impulses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Materials Science"}
