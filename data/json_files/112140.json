They find that these tests can be effective in identifying the presence of digitaline and related substances, but caution that further research is needed to determine the accuracy and conclusiveness of these tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Toxicology"}
