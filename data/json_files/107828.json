The study aims to improve the mathematical theory connecting the Earth's figure with the variation of gravity on its surface and determine the exact figure of the Earth using experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
