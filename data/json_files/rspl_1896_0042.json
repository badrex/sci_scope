The research focuses on seven dimensions and reveals that the mean values of these dimensions change throughout the crab's life, with the forehead becoming relatively shorter as the crab grows. The findings suggest that the generalised probability curve for the data is close to a normal distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Morphology"}
