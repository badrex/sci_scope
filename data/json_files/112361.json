Rennoldson observed the total solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, on board the \"Rangoon\" ship. He noticed two prominences on the moon's right limb with a yellow flame color and a square shape. The corona's color was observed as red, yellowish green, blue, and violet, with violet being the brightest initially. Rennoldson also used a spectroscope, but due to the ship's motion and haze, he could not make more precise observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
