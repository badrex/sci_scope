They find that the gauge's ability to detect vacuum perfection is limited, as evidenced by the changes in the electrical discharge's form. The study highlights the importance of understanding the connection between vacuum and electrical discharge for scientific advancements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
