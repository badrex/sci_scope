They observe various structural changes and discuss the role of acidity and alkalinity in the staining process, suggesting that these factors may be related to the distribution of potassium salts in nerve fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
