The researchers found that the motor roots of these plexuses are responsible for controlling complex coordinated movements of the limbs and that most muscles receive fibers from multiple roots. This research has implications for understanding the distribution of motor roots in humans as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
