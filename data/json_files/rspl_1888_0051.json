The results show that the minimum proportion of acid required to change the potential varies depending on the type of metal and galvanometer used, and the order of change in electromotive force by varying the strength of the liquid is similar for different metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
