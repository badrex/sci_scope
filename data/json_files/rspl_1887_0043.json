They discover that the process involves the formation of cuprous oxide and the generation of a voltaic current, which can be controlled by adjusting the resistance in the circuit. The authors also compare their findings to the 'air-battery' described by Gladstone and Tribe in 1873.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
