They discover that the main product is propylene dichloride, with smaller amounts of normal propyl chloride and other compounds. The study also highlights the formation of trichlorhydrine and hexachlorpropane, providing insights into the limits of direct substitution in propane and other hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms"}
