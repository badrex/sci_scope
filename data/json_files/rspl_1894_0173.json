The author finds that temperature has a significant impact on bacterial growth, with higher temperatures leading to fewer microbes. The study also highlights the importance of sunshine in the destruction of bacteria, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in maintaining water quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental Microbiology & Water Quality"}
