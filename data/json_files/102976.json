Hauksbee, conducts a series of experiments on the production and propagation of light from phosphorus in a vacuum. He discovers that the luminosity increases as the air pressure decreases and that the light emitted is in the form of vivid streams. The light disappears when air is reintroduced, and the experiment cannot be replicated in open air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
