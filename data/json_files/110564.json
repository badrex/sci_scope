Lubbock examines the relationship between changes in atmospheric pressure and fluctuations in the height of high-water. He verifies the existence of this relationship at Liverpool and London, and suggests further research to determine if the ocean's surface rises simultaneously in narrow seas with the depression of the barometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrodynamics"}
