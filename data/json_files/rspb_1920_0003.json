The research shows that in cases of avian beriberi, the weight of the adrenals and the total adrenalin per kilogram of body-weight significantly exceed healthy limits, suggesting a link between adrenal function and the development of edema in beriberi.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nutrition & Endocrinology"}
