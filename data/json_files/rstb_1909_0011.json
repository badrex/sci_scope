The research focuses on the number, arrangement, size, and general morphology of the giant cells, as well as the giant fibres' sheath, neurofibrillae, and posterior giant cells. The findings provide insights into the structure and function of these remarkable elements in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
