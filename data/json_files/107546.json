The case study illustrates the development of the fetus within the ovarium and the formation of the placenta, which appears to be similar to that of a typical in-utero conception. This rare case offers valuable insights into the process of conception and embryonic development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Reproductive Biology"}
