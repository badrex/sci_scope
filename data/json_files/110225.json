He describes the construction of an instrument with variable magnification and emphasizes the importance of light management. Lister also addresses optical illusions and fallacies that can occur during microscopy and presents a principle to overcome the limitations of microscope lenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
