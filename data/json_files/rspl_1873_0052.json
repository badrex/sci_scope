They discovered that the first effect of magnetization was an increase in resistance, followed by a decrease in resistance when the magnetism was on. The results suggest that the first effect is related to both the previous treatment of the wire and the application of magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Induction"}
