Adrian Azout", "topics": ["Magnetic Declination", "Earth's Magnetic Field", "Geophysics", "Magnetic Needle", "Observational Astronomy"], "tldr": "M. Adrian Azout observes the declination of the magnet in Rome and finds that the magnetic needle declines slightly more than two degrees westward. He discusses possible causes for the variation in the magnet's direction and suggests that it may be due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field caused by natural and artificial alterations in the Earth's composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
