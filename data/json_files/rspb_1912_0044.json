They discover two localized peroxydases in the Chinese primrose (Primula sinensis) and demonstrate their relationship to pigment formation and color patterns in flowers. This research has implications for understanding the physiological roles of oxydases in plants and contributes to the understanding of Mendelian characters in specific plant and animal species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Genetics"}
