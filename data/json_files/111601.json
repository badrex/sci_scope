He uses a galvanometer and a sensitive chemical mixture to detect this action, observing differences between newly-laid and older eggs. Davy suggests that electrochemical action plays an important role in the egg's biology and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
