The study reveals similarities between the Alcyonarian and Syringopora, supporting the classification of Syringopora as an Alcyonarian, and suggests that Tubipora should be united with the Cornularidae into a group called Stolonifera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Marine Biology"}
