He infers that only a small portion of the brain is necessary for nerve origins, and the cerebellum may aid in voluntary act steadiness and vital function energy. The corpus striatum is considered a center for conveying limb motion perception to the mind.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
