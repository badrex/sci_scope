H. Strange and E. Graham, examines the movements and photographic analysis of detonation waves in gas explosions. They find that the temperature of the gas appears to increase abruptly, and the luminosity of the gas remains for some time after the wave has passed. The detonation wave's velocity is compared to the velocity of sound in gases, providing an approximation of the temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
