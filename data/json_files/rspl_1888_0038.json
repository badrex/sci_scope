The study examines the effects of various substances on the electromotive force of the couple and demonstrates the delicacy and sensitivity of the method. The results can be used as tests for the purity and uniformity of dissolved substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
