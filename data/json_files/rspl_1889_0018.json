The results suggest a differentiation in the pyramidal tract, with the whole area degenerating when both external and mesial motor areas are removed, while only a corresponding part degenerates after removal of one area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
