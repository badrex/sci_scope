Contrary to popular belief, he finds that tin does not significantly impact the ductility or brittleness of gold when mixed in small quantities. This challenges the widely held opinion among metallurgists and chemical writers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
