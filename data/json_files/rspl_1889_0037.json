They discover that the lead sulfate formed and decomposed in the cell is not the ordinary white sulfate, but rather two different lead salts. The author presents equations for the electrolytic reactions taking place in the cell, depending on the active material of the battery plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
