The results show that the total ionisation is practically independent of pressure for gases without atoms heavier than oxygen, while it increases with pressure for gases containing atoms heavier than oxygen. The study also reveals that the energy liberated in the form of soft X-rays is of the same order as that liberated in the form of cathode rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Nuclear Physics"}
