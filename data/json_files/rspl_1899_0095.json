They determine the ionic velocity in a unit electric field and compare their results with previous findings, providing insights into the charges carried by different ions and their relationship to electrolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
