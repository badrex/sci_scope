The experiments reveal that a smooth resin surface can retain an electric charge and that the character of the stress figures depends on factors such as the form and size of the terminals, the distance from the dielectric surface, and the potential and character of the spark at the spark-gap.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena"}
