The experiments reveal that the conditions necessary for the appearance of these phenomena include a perfect vacuum, the absorption of moisture, and the introduction of vapor from naphtha or phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena"}
