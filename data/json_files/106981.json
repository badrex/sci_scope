This phenomenon was observed due to a unique combination of weather conditions and the position of the sun, allowing the cliffs and landmarks on the opposite coast to appear closer and more distinct than usual.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
