They describe the dentition process in six different families, highlighting the distinct characteristics of dental succession in these animals compared to other mammals. The study reveals that Marsupialia have a peculiar dental pattern, with only a single tooth on each side of each jaw undergoing vertical displacement and succession.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
