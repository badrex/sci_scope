Halley investigates the cause of the change in the Earth's magnetic needle variation and proposes a hypothesis that involves the Earth's internal structure and the movement of its magnetic poles. He suggests that the Earth's magnetic field is generated by a moving internal substance that is detached from the external parts of the Earth, and that this movement can explain the observed changes in the magnetic needle's direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
