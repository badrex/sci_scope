The method involves plotting various curves to determine the trajectory, change of direction, and striking energy of a projectile. This approach aids in understanding the behavior of projectiles in flight and can be applied to various projectile types and initial velocities.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering"}
