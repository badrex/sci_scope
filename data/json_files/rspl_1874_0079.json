They measure this constant in absolute units using distilled water and an electric current in a helix to generate magnetic force. The result obtained is a value of 0.0001 centimeter-gramme-seconds, with dimensions being the reciprocal of current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
