The author examines lactase, emulsin, and maltase, and finds that the rate of hydrolysis is influenced by the concentration of enzymes and the presence of hydrolysis products, deviating from the traditional law of mass action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
