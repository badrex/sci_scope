They find that the vapour pressure increases above the expected value at the melting point before eventually decreasing, suggesting that this method could be useful in studying rapid and delicate changes in vapour pressure at freezing points.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
