The authors found that the average maximum temperature in boys around 12 years old is 99.1\u00b0F, with a diurnal variation of about 2.2\u00b0F. The study also highlights the importance of continuous observations to accurately measure temperature changes and understand their implications in health and disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
