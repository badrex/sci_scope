He concludes that the time required for a substance to penetrate capillary vessels is negligible, and the interval between absorption and general diffusion through the body may not exceed nine seconds. The contact of a poison with a large surface of the body is not sufficient to cause general symptoms if its diffusion is prevented.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pharmacology & Toxicology"}
