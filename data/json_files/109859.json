He also shows that the growth of immature leaves depends on the mature leaves, and that fruit development relies on the presence of mature leaves. These findings contribute to our understanding of plant growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
