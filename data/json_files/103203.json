He concludes that the water does not have a petrifying quality and that the stone-like objects found on the shore are likely due to the water's erosion and not the water itself. Nevill also shares his observations on the lake's fish population, including the 'freshwater herrings' or pollans, and the lake's healing properties, particularly in treating skin ailments and rheumatism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Limnology & Geology"}
