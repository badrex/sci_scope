The results suggest that the internal resistance to change of shape in solids and liquids depends on the rapidity of the change, and that the loss of energy is not solely due to molecular friction or elastic afterworking.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solid State Physics & Materials Science"}
