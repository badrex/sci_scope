The study reveals that the absorption band of hemoglobin is more distinctive than the bands in the visible spectrum, and that the center of absorption is slightly closer to the red end of the spectrum than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
