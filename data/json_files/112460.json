Their findings, recorded in a series of diagrams, aimed to determine if the position of the D line of the spectrum changes with the coefficient of terrestrial gravity. The observations were made with great care, and the data collected could potentially provide valuable insights into the relationship between the spectroscope readings, barometer, and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
