He detected pus globules in the blood using a combination of chemical and microscopic methods. This discovery supports the idea that suppuration is a form of blood analysis and that unhealthy pus, mixed with broken-down fibrin, is associated with inflammatory or typhoid fevers.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pathology & Infectious Diseases"}
