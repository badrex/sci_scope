He uses a post with marked divisions to observe the water's rise and fall, taking into account various factors that may affect the measurements. Maskelyne's observations reveal the greatest rise and fall of the water at the syzygies of the Sun and Moon, as well as the mean time of high water happening 2 hours and 15 minutes after the Moon's passing the meridian.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Science"}
