Allan Broun and discusses its historical context, design, and potential improvements. The instrument aims to measure small variations in gravity using the principle of statical gravimetry and has implications for understanding the Earth's structure and geophysics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
