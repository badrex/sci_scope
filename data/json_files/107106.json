The findings suggest that electricity is evolved during the action of an acid on a metal, and the formation of hydrogen gas depends on the transfer of electricity between the fluid and the metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Reactions"}
