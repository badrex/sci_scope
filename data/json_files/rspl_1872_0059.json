They discover that the maximum effect occurs at or just outside the red rays, near the locus of the maximum heat rays, suggesting a power in these rays to alter the molecular condition of selenium instantaneously.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Optical Materials"}
