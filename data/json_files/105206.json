Both authors propose that the difference in refrangibility can be explained by the difference in velocity of light rays. However, Clairaut argues that Mr. de Courtivron's calculations provide a more solid foundation for this hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
