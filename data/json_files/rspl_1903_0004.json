The author uses a spark between iron terminals in hydrogen as a constant source of ultraviolet light and measures the photo-electric currents from a zinc surface. The results show that the currents increase with decreasing pressure and can be explained using the ionic theory of conduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
