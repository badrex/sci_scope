The research reveals that excised hearts can have longer contractions and latent periods, and that electrical variations can be detected even after visible contractions have ceased.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology"}
