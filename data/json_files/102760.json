The author also investigates the alternate motion of the heart's auricles and ventricles, concluding that the heart's structure and function are closely related to those of other muscles in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Physiology"}
