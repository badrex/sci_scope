The research shows that the material can exist in two states, magnetic and non-magnetic, with different electrical resistances and mechanical strengths. The non-magnetic state has a lower specific resistance and is softer, while the magnetic state has a higher breaking stress and hardness. The potential applications and implications of this material are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Alloy Development"}
