Newland's Method for Distilling Fresh Water from Salt Water at Sea", "topics": ["Desalination", "Distillation", "Water Treatment", "Marine Science", "Freshwater Supply"], "tldr": "Capt. Newland presents a simple and effective method for distilling fresh water from salt water at sea using a copper or iron pot, an empty cask, sheet lead, a small jar, and wood-ashes or soap. The process involves boiling saltwater mixed with wood-ashes to soften the salt, and then condensing the steam into fresh water in a receiver jar. The method produces 8-10 gallons of fresh water per day and requires periodic replenishment of the still with saltwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Water Resources"}
