He describes two forms of magnetic electrical machines and conducts experiments to determine their relative powers. Sturgeon also investigates the effects of different velocities of rotation and the impact of multiplying the channels of conduction on the instruments' performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
