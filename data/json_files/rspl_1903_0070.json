They find that the radium glow spectrum coincides with the band spectrum of nitrogen, suggesting that the radium rays may be responsible for exciting the nitrogen molecules. The authors also explore the possibility of detecting the presence of helium in the radium glow spectrum but find no evidence of its presence.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
