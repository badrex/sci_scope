They find that certain bucks and does tend to produce a preponderance of one sex, and that a doe resulting from prolonged inbreeding is more likely to produce female offspring. The study also suggests that inbreeding a buck with his daughter, granddaughter, etc., for several generations may lead to an excess of female offspring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Evolution"}
