Results show that while hydrochloric and nitric acids significantly slow down the reaction, other acids like benzoic, succinic, and acetic acids have a lesser effect. The study also suggests that negative ions may influence enzyme activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
