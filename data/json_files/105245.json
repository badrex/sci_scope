The experiments reveal that mercury has a greater affinity with gold than platina, and that platina can be separated from gold using these methods, although the process is not perfect and requires further refinement.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
