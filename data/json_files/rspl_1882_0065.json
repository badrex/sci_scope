The results show that the heart beats faster with warm blood and slower with cold blood, and that the temperature of the blood in the coronary arteries has a greater impact on the rate of beat than the temperature in the right auricle or ventricle. The findings suggest that the mammalian heart, including the human heart, can respond to temperature changes within a wide range, without needing to involve extrinsic nervous apparatuses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
