The results show that the force emanating from the active zinc center diffuses over the entire upper hemisphere, and the force is maintained by either hemisphere indifferently. When both hemispheres are in metallic communication, there is no increase in force, but it spreads equally over the whole sphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Cells"}
