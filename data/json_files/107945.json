They made adjustments to the pendulum and observed the rate of the pendulum in various arcs of vibration. The results showed that the compensation for the arcs, when the pendulum was vibrated with the weight above, was in defect and required a multiplier to achieve accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Dynamics"}
