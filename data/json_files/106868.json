By using pure dephlogisticated and inflammable air, he finds that the acid produced comes from the union of these two types of air, challenging the phlogiston theory and the composition of water as previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
