This opens up a new field of investigation in fatigue testing, with implications for reducing testing time and improving understanding of material behavior under rapid stress changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
