The method involves using picrate fluid and observing the evolution of hydrocyanic acid in response to different anaesthetics. This method can be used to estimate minute quantities of HCN, with potential applications in studying the relationship between chemical and electrical changes in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis"}
