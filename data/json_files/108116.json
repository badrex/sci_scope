The author presents a method to calculate these terms and provides analytical expressions for the terms upon which the secular inequalities depend. The results are applicable to the development of the disturbing function in terms of true longitudes and can be used to improve the accuracy of celestial mechanics calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
