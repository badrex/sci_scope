The observations include daily measurements of barometer, temperature, and atmospheric pressure, as well as the effects of latitude and longitude on these variables. The findings show a lower barometer within the tropics and a rapid descent of the mercury with the increase of latitude. The paper also compares these results with previous observations and discusses the differences in pressure and temperature between equatorial and high-latitude regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate"}
