The tumour contained a fluid resembling urine, and upon examination, it was found that the kidneys were not involved in the condition. The tumour was caused by a defect in the spine, which prevented the proper distribution of nerves and resulted in the formation of the tumour. The condition is incurable and often leads to the child's death.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pediatrics & Neonatology"}
