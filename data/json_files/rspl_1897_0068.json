The authors find that the frequency distribution is continuous and fairly uniform along lines called generalised isobars. They also discuss the constants that best describe a local barometric frequency and explore the concept of correlation between stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
