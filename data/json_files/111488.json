Girald\u00e9s, discovers tubular and vesicular structures in the spermatic cord, which he calls \"Corps Innomine.\" These structures are remnants of the Wolffian body from the embryo and can be found in both males and females. The author also suggests that some cysts in the spermatic cord may originate from the dilatation of the tubular elements of the \"Corps Innomine.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
