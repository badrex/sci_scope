The calf had two functional mouths, two eyes, and two ears. The calf was able to breathe through both mouths and had a single throat. The calf took nourishment only through the perfect mouth, while the other mouth had a weak jaw that remained open. The calf appeared healthy and lively, and was as strong as other calves at three days old.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Studies"}
