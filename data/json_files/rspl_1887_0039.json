The instrument combines the advantages of a thermopile and a galvanometer, offering greater sensitivity and a more precise zero point. The author discusses the design, potential improvements, and preliminary experiments with the instrument.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
