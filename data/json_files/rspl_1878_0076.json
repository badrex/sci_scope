They provide a detailed description of the changes in the Mullerian duct and its connection to the body cavity, and suggest that this discovery supports the homology between birds and other vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
