He hypothesizes that the nerve fibers are made up of soft fluid globules, which are exhaled during drying. The author also proposes a mechanism for how the animal spirits representing visual images pass through the optic nerve to the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
