Cuthbertson and E. B. R. Prideaux, determine the refractive index of gaseous fluorine using Jamin's refractometer. They find that the gas was not completely free from air or oxygen produced during electrolysis, so they analyzed the mixture of gases in the refractometer tube using lead filings. The refractivity of fluorine for sodium light was found to be 195, which is within 2-3% of the true value and verifies the predicted ratio of refractivities between fluorine and chlorine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis"}
