The results show that decerebrate rigidity is independent of the pyramidal system and that the inhibitory center is located in the thalamus. The cerebellum does not influence decerebrate rigidity, and the adjuvant center is Deiter's nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
