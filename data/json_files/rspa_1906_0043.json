This challenges the notion that bodies under great hydrostatic pressure cannot be treated using elastic theory, and suggests that the rigidity of the Earth's interior may be increased under such conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Seismology"}
