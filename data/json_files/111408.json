They discover that these bases possess basic properties and can form various compounds. The research also highlights the similarities between phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony compounds in their composition, properties, and reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Organometallic Chemistry"}
