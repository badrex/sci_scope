They discuss the limitations of the Balmer formula and the influence of different conditions of excitation on the structure of the lines. The study also explores the widths of the hydrogen lines and the possible causes of broadening, such as the Stark effect and the Doppler effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
