He discovers that when these substances are acted upon by a voltaic battery, they can form metallic alloys and decompose water. Davy also successfully repeats an experiment by Berzelius and Pontin, decomposing ammonia into a soft amalgam.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
