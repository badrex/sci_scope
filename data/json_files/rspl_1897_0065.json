They find that the amount of light transmitted varies depending on whether the substance is fluorescing or not, and they explore the underlying mechanisms and potential applications of this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
