He finds that iron loses weight when cooled, while copper gains weight. The results challenge the prevailing opinions of the time and suggest further inquiry into the properties of materials when heated and cooled.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
