He also examines the effects of various gases on the discharge and the nature of electric light. Faraday concludes that electric light is a consequence of the quantity of electricity that flows and converges towards the spot where it finds the easiest passage.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
