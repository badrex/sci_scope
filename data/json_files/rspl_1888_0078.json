The research explores the effects of surface polishing on the reflective and transmission properties of glass and suggests that the polishing process may alter the optical density of the surface layer, impacting the amount of light reflected and transmitted.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
