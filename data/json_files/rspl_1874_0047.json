They observe distinct absorption patterns in the blue and red regions of the spectrum, as well as channelled-space absorption in some cases. This research extends the understanding of metal spectra and their potential applications in chemistry and metallurgy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
