The author, William Beneke, demonstrates that phosphate of lime is necessary for cell formation in humans, animals, and plants. He also discusses the role of oxalic acid in the body and its connection to diseases, as well as the effects of various factors, such as diet and oxygen intake, on the production of oxalic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Physiology"}
