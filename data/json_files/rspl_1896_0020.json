The experiments show that the permeability of soft annealed iron decreases when cooled to temperatures around 200 degrees Celsius below zero, with the maximum permeability reduced from 3400 at ordinary temperatures to 2700 when cooled to liquid air temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
