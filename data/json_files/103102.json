Cressener, observed the lunar eclipse of February 2, 1701/2, at Streatham near London, and compared the results with calculations based on Sir Isaac Newton's and Horrox's theories. The observation showed that Newton's theory agreed more closely with the observed data, demonstrating its accuracy and improving the understanding of lunar eclipses.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Eclipse Studies"}
