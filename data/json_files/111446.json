Blakiston at York Fort in Hudson's Bay in 1857. The results confirm the accuracy of previous magnetic force values and reveal a reversal in the direction of isogonic lines, supporting Halley's hypothesis on the double system of terrestrial magnetic forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
