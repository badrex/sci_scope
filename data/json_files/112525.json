Dupr\u00e9 and F. J. M. Page, investigate the specific heat of various mixtures of alcohol and water. They find that the specific heat of these mixtures is higher than that of water itself, up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%. The authors also compare their results with previous research by Regnault and Kopp.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
