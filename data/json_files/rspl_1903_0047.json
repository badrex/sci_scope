The study reveals that hunting is not always due to resonance and can be caused by instability in the motor's motion, leading to the development of cross-magnetizing currents and potential loss of synchronization.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Power Systems"}
