The study reveals that the conductivity of the air for both positive and negative electricity is irregular, with distinct double maxima and minima values. The author also finds that nor'westers have a negative potential relative to the earth, contrary to the usual condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
