The results show that the relationship between rotation and temperature is linear for carbon bisulphide, while for water, the rate of change of rotation with temperature increases as the temperature rises. The authors argue that using water as a reference for molecular rotation in magnetic rotation studies may not be accurate and suggest employing other liquids with higher rotations for more precise measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
