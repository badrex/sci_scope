One stream is bluish, lukewarm, and bubbling, while the other is ice-cold and turbid. Drinking water from the streams causes birds to die, but some men with worms find relief. The third stream is greenish and has a pleasant taste, possibly a mix of the other two.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrogeology & Water Chemistry"}
