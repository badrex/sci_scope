They find that the magnetic property of a substance depends on the molecular structure and the distortion caused by the mutual actions between molecules. The study provides evidence for the existence of molecular complexes in solution and sheds light on the relationship between molecular complexity and specific diamagnetic susceptibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
