He observes that these objects undergo changes in their forms and brightness, suggesting a progression of condensation. This study provides insights into the materiality and opacity of these celestial bodies, as well as their potential connection to planetary formation and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Cosmology"}
