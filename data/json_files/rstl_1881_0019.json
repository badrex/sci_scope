They describe the polian vesicle, circular canal, tentacle sinuses, radial canals, and pedicels, as well as the role of the perivisceral fluid and the cloacal valve in the locomotion of these creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
