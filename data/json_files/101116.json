He discovers that the glow-worm's shining is affected by its position and environment, and that it may not shine when still. Templer also notes the difference in color and intensity of the glow-worm's light under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Entomology"}
