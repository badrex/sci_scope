The results are negative for helium, but positive for nitrogen and hydrogen. The author concludes that helium is mechanically retained by phosphorus, while nitrogen and hydrogen are chemically retained.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
