He suggests that the current is caused by the prevalence of westerly winds in the Atlantic, which push water along the north coast of Spain, creating a current that extends to the west of Scilly and Ireland. This current can be dangerous for ships navigating the British Channel and may be responsible for deviations from their intended course.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Currents"}
