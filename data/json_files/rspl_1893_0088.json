They find that the efficiency decreases as the frequency of the alternating current increases, and that a significant portion of the energy is lost in the resistance of the electrolyte.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
