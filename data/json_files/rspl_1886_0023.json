They find that a bright surface requires less energy to produce the same amount of light compared to a dull black surface, suggesting that surface appearance plays a significant role in the efficiency of light and heat emission.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
