Hauksbee conducted an experiment at a Royal Society meeting to study the effect of air rarefaction on sound. He observed that as the air pressure decreased, the sound from a bell became weaker and more distant-sounding. When the air was reintroduced, the sound became louder and clearer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
