They find that the rise in pulmonary blood pressure is minimal compared to the significant increase in systemic blood pressure, suggesting that pulmonary vessels do not have a system of vaso-motor nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Anatomy"}
