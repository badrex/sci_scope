Experiments reveal that pressure can influence the solubility of salts, with mechanical force being a key factor in the process. This research provides insight into the relationship between mechanical and chemical forces and the potential for pressure to impact chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
