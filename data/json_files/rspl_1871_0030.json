The study reveals that the passive tension of the diaphragm is essential for retaining supplemental air in the lungs, limiting the encroachment of abdominal viscera on the thoracic cavity, and maintaining the heart's movement during respiration. This tension also plays a role in the body's response to various conditions, such as pregnancy and ovarian tumors.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
