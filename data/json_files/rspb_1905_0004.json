The authors found that the average carbon dioxide content was 94 volumes per 10,000 volumes of air, with the highest level recorded at 3.60 parts per 10,000 during a foggy day. They also observed that the carbon dioxide content was generally higher in winter months, but noted an exception in 1901 when July had a higher average. The authors suggest that these variations could impact plant growth and are important for meteorologists and agriculturists to consider.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Climate Change"}
