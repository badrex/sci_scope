Experiments with copper sulfate solutions and silver and copper strips demonstrate that the positive radical accumulates at the end of the conductor near the positive electrode, while the negative radical spreads over a greater surface area.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
