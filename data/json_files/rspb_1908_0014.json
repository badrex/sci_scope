The research is based on petrified specimens from the Lower Coal Measures of Shore-Littleborough in Lancashire, revealing details of the stems' structure, including the presence of a well-marked pith, scalariform tracheides, and a unique ribbing pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Sciences"}
