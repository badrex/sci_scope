He finds that vibrations are larger in a vacuum and that adding weight to a clock increases the vibrations, causing it to lose time. The author also investigates the effects of heat and cold on iron rods and suggests that these factors may contribute to the phenomenon of pendulum clocks running slower near the equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Physics"}
