Experiments conducted by Mr. Michael Clark demonstrate that the distilled sea-water is free from marine salt and its acid spirit. The process is analyzed and compared to other methods of water treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences"}
