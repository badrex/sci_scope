The experiments reveal that increasing temperature and magnetization can increase the permeability, but the initial permeability decreases after mechanical disturbance. The study also compares the hysteresis loops of the iron alloy to a normal specimen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
