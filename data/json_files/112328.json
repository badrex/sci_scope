W. Hofmann investigates the formation of aniline-red colorant and discovers that it is derived from a mixture of aniline and toluidine. He also finds that commercial aniline contains a higher boiling point substance, which is identified as toluidine. The presence of toluidine in commercial aniline is crucial for the formation of aniline-red colorant.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Dyes"}
