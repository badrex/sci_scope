They find that cloudy weather and visible vapour can increase the effects of solar radiation, and that light cloud and opalescent vapour intensify insolation when in the direction of the sun. The author also conducts experiments with screens to study the effects of bright glare and light vapoury cloud on solar radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
