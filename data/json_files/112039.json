They discover that the density of these minerals decreases when heated and then returns to its original state after a month. This phenomenon suggests that heat can be absorbed and released by minerals without undergoing a change of state.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineralogy & Crystallography"}
