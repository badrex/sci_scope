Grove investigates the direct production of heat by magnetism and conducts experiments to eliminate interference from other heat sources. He finds that when a bar of soft iron or other magnetic metal is magnetized, its temperature rises, suggesting a molecular friction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
