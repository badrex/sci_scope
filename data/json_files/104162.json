The instrument, consisting of a brass plate, a telescope, and two speculums, allows for accurate observations even in the motion of a ship. This method can be used to determine latitude and observation times more precisely than current methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeodetics & Celestial Mechanics"}
