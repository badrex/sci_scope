Stokes, investigates the long spectrum of electric light and its properties, particularly focusing on the invisible rays of extreme refrangibility. He examines the fluorescence produced by various substances and the absorption of these rays by different materials. Stokes also discusses the advantages of using broad electrodes and the blue negative light formed in an arc discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
