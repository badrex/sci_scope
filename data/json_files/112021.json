The research explores the influence of factors such as diffusion, motion, temperature, and various chemical substances on blood's ability to absorb oxygen and exhalate carbonic acid. The findings reveal the importance of certain conditions, like heat and age, on blood's chemical transformations and decompositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Medical Physiology & Pathology"}
