They find that wild animals, such as waterbuck, bushbuck, and situtunga, are naturally infected with T. uniforme, and that G. palpalis may be the carrier of this species of trypanosome.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
