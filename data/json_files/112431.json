The observations were taken from April 1867 to December 1868, and the results show an increase in the dip and provide probable errors for each period. The author suggests a rate of annual change in the dip and discusses possible causes for differences in needle readings.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
