The author compares the tensile strength of different types of iron and timber, and concludes that iron is five times stronger than oak, making iron ships more secure and stronger than those built with timber.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
