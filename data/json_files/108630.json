'Plover' at Point Barrow between 1852 and 1854. The observations reveal that the aurora is connected to the movements of the magnet, with brighter auroras causing quicker magnetic changes. The study also highlights the challenges faced during the observations, such as extreme weather and instrument damage due to the cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geomagnetism"}
