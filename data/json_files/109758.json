He measured the sun's position without relying on a plumb-line or level, and the results were accurate within one-tenth of a second. The observations were subject to uncertainty regarding astronomical refraction, and Pond used Dr. Bradley's data for this calculation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
