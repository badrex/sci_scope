He discovers that electric currents induce a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current. This work laid the foundation for the principles of electromagnetic induction and the understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
