He finds that these bodies are formed during fermentation and that the absorption of carbonic acid precedes their formation. The absorption of carbonic acid by the soil is greatest during the night and is regulated by a compensating provision in nature, maintaining a constant proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences"}
