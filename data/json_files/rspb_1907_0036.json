They find that globulins form solutions with acids and alkalies, and can be both acidic and basic, making them amphoteric electrolytes. The study also explores the relationship between globulins and colloidal solutions, finding that they do not form true gels and have unique interactions with electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
