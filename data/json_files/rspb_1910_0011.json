They find that the rate of action increases with temperature and that the temperature coefficient of increase ranges from 2.0 to 2.52 per 10\u00b0C. The study provides insights into the relationship between temperature and drug action, with implications for drug dosing and treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pharmacology & Toxicology"}
