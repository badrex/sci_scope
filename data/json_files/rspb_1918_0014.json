They present evidence supporting the likelihood of anthocyan pigments being produced through flavonols and discuss the potential for a relationship between the amount of flavonol and corresponding anthocyan in flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
