The study finds that there are distinct foci in the cerebral cortex responsible for adduction and abduction of the vocal cords, as well as acceleration and intensification of their movements. The findings suggest that the peripheral laryngeal apparatus has a minimal influence on the effects obtained from the central nervous mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Neurophysiology"}
