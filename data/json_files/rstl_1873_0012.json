They used an electrodynamometer and an absolute electrometer to measure the force of attraction between two disks and the difference of potentials between the poles of a battery, ultimately expressing the results in terms of mass, time, and space units.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
