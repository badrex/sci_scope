He discusses the existence of matter in the vicinity of the sun, which manifests during total eclipses through emission, absorption, and polarization phenomena. The presence of a rare hydrogen-based atmosphere extending beyond the chromosphere and protuberances is also confirmed.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
