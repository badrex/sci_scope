The research focuses on the differentiation of cartilage and bone, as well as the morphological regions and their comparison in various bird types. The findings provide valuable insights into the skull development in birds and its relation to other vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Ornithology"}
