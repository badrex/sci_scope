Abney's study on the transmission of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere, focusing on light scattering at various altitudes. The research uses platino-type paper to record observations and compares the results with spectrum measurements. The value of k in the formula for calculating the loss of light intensity is determined, and a table is provided showing the transmitted light values at different altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
