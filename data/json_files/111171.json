He also suggests that these contortions in gneiss and schist were formed when the rock matter was semi-fluid, allowing mineral ingredients to separate and re-arrange themselves under pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
