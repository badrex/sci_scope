The method involves converting symbols in the equations, leading to new forms of solutions that may be interpretable or not. The author also discusses connections between the solutions obtained and those of the same equations in the form of definite integrals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Applied Mathematics"}
