He concludes that the Eustachian tubes are usually closed, and the act of swallowing opens them. The author argues that the function of hearing is best carried out with the tympanum as a closed cavity, contrary to the common belief that the air within the tympanum must communicate freely with the outer air.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Otolaryngology & Audiology"}
