Clerk Maxwell, investigates the theory of maintaining electric currents by mechanical work without using permanent magnets. He explores the effects of electromagnetic momentum and the role of commutators in electric circuits, providing a rough explanation of the underlying principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
