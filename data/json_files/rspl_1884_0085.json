They find that glucinum belongs to the same class as carbon, boron, and silicon, and confirm its atomic weight using vapor-density measurements of its compounds. This research supports the periodic law and provides a foundation for understanding beryllium's role in the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
