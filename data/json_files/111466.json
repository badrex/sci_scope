Gassiot, investigates the stratifications and dark bands in electrical discharges observed in Torricellian vacuums. He describes his experiments using various apparatus and methods, and distinguishes between two forms of the stratified electrical discharge: the direct and the induced discharge. Gassiot also discusses the potential influence of magnets on these discharges and suggests further research on the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena"}
