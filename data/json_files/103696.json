The pumice stones were found in the South Atlantic Ocean, thousands of miles away from any known land. Dove documented the location, size, and density of the pumice drifts, and speculated on their origin. This report is an important early observation of oceanic pumice distribution and its potential impact on navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Geology"}
