They discover that the filaments within the nodules consist of straight rodlets, which transform into X, Y, and Y-shaped bacteroids. The authors also investigate the role of Nitragin in plant growth and infection, finding that it can increase yield in soils poor in nitrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
