They employ a zinc sulphide screen and a microscope to count scintillations produced by the \u03b1-particles. The results show that the rate of emission of \u03b1-particles from uranium is in fair agreement with previous findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nuclear Chemistry & Radiochemistry"}
