They find that the chance of a \u03b2-ray making another \u03b2-ray is roughly proportional to the atomic weight of the radiator. The results suggest that \u03b2-radiation is most likely produced when the \u03b2-ray is suddenly stopped or loses a great part of its energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Particle Physics & Nuclear Physics"}
