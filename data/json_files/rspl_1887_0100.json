The authors explore the properties of these numbers, including their asymptotic behavior and the conditions under which they are minima. They also present a new formula for calculating these numbers and provide a comprehensive bibliography of the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Number Theory & Algebra"}
