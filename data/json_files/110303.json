He concludes that the crater was formed entirely by loose materials from volcanic action and not by rock from the sea bed. He also notes the close and oppressive heat in the area but believes it is not directly related to the volcano.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Volcanology & Geology"}
