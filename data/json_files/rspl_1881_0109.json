They propose a new distinction between gas and vapour based on molecular velocity and mean free path, and discuss the importance of accurate experimental methods in determining these properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
