He identifies the plants as the three-leaved Hellebore and Galium Tinctorium, and experiments with their dyeing capabilities. The author suggests that these natural dyes could be useful in European textiles and could lead to new branches of commerce.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
