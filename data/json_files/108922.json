They argue that the proportion of length to breadth and the waterlines should be influenced by the weight of the material, and that adopting a form of greater resistance can contribute to economy and efficiency in certain ship classes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Naval Engineering & Shipbuilding"}
