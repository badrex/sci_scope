He compares the fossil to known recent and fossil Saurians and applies a microscopic test to the bone and tooth tissues. Owen concludes that the fossil belongs to a large, carnivorous lacertian reptile, distinct from the largest existing toothed and pleurodont lizard, Hydrosaurus giganteus. He proposes the name Notiosaurus dentatus for this extinct pleurodont Saurian.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
