Using a vertical telescope filled with water, the author observes the meridional zenith distance of y Draconis and finds that the hypothesis of Professor Klinkerfues is not supported, as the true aberration is the same as the received aberration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
