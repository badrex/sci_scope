The study shows that the relationship between carbon dioxide expelled and oxygen absorbed varies between individuals, with some showing a constant figure while others exhibit a different pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
