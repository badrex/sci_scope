He finds that while some dephlogisticated air enters the blood, most is used to form fixed air during the respiration process. The author also discovers that part of the phlogisticated air enters the blood, suggesting that the dephlogisticated air consumed is not of the purest kind.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Gas Laws"}
