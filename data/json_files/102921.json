He also shares his observations of the storm's impact, including the saltiness of vegetation and the presence of sulfurous fumes in some areas. Derham suggests that the storm's intensity may have been influenced by a combination of wet and warm weather conditions, as well as the presence of nitro-sulphureous or other heterogeneous matter in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
