The research finds that cold storage work has a high fluctuation in energy output, with the load varying greatly depending on the amount of work done. The study concludes that the correlation between the physiological cost and the energy output is masked by the effects of work fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Biomechanics"}
