He explores the effectiveness of various metals, such as iron and zinc, in forming insoluble compounds on the surface, which protect the underlying metal from corrosion and adhesion of weeds and shellfish.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Corrosion"}
