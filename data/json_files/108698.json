Experiments were conducted on three types of glass, and the results showed that the resistance of glass cylinders to compression follows a similar law as sheet iron cylinders. The tensile strength of glass bars was found to be smaller than when burst by internal pressure in the form of thin globes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
