The research demonstrates that the rate of moisture absorption is influenced by the nature of the solute and its concentration, with phenolic solutions generally accelerating the absorption process compared to pure water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Botany"}
