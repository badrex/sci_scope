They accurately measured the spectra and calculated the wave-lengths of the lines, comparing them with previous measurements. The study includes 2307 lines from various elements, with a series of eighteen enlarged photographs presented alongside the paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectral Analysis"}
