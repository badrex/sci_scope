They find that certain calcium salts can either promote or inhibit clot formation, depending on their concentration and ability to lower the surface tension of water. The study suggests that adsorbable substances can inhibit clot formation, but this effect can be counteracted by the addition of an appropriate enzyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
