The method involves analyzing tidal observations using the harmonic system and considering the time of moon's transit, time of year, and other variables to create accurate predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
