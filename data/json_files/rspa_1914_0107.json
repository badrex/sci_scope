He explains how the scattering of alpha particles provides evidence for the intense electric fields within the atom and the dimensions of the nucleus. Rutherford also suggests that the atomic number may be the defining property of elements, with hydrogen having one charge, helium two, and so on.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Nuclear Physics"}
