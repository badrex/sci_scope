The study reveals that the absorption spectra vary depending on the state and solvent, with the blue end of the spectrum being cut off and absorption extending towards the less refrangible end as the thickness of the iodine layer increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
