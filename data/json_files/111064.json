The author, W. Whewell, discusses the height of high water and its variations between spring and neap tides. The study finds that the curve of tidal heights is nearly the same at all locations, and the semi-mensual series of heights at one place can be used as a rule for other places with similar tidal differences. The study also shows that the equilibrium theory's predictions align with the observed tidal curves, although some modifications are needed for actual cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
