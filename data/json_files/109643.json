He experiments with various surfaces and configurations to understand the formation of these rings and their associated colors. He concludes that only two surfaces are essential for the formation of these rings and that the cause of these phenomena must be either in the nature of the rays themselves or in the surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
