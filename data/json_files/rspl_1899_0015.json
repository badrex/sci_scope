The study shows that offspring from the same parthenogenetic brood exhibit considerable variability, challenging the theory that offspring produced by parthenogenesis exhibit little or no variability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Evolution"}
