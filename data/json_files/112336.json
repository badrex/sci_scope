Beale investigates the minute structure of the grey matter in the brains of humans, sheep, cats, and dogs, demonstrating the connection between nerve cells and fibers. He also reveals that the so-called 'granular matter' is composed of fine nerve fibers, and that cells in the grey matter are connected by fibers, which become thinner as they extend.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
