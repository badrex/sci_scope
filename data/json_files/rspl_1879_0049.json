De La Rue and H. W. M\u00fcller investigate the electric discharge using a chloride of silver battery and a bell-jar. They study the resistance, pressure, and potential required to produce a discharge in various gases, such as air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid. The authors also observe a sudden expansion of gas when the terminals are connected to the battery, which they attribute to an increase in pressure rather than temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Optical Physics"}
