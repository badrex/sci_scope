The research shows that cranial nerves develop from outgrowths of the brain and do not originate from the external epiblast, challenging previous theories on nerve development in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
