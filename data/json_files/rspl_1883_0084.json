The study reveals that the existence of these transient currents is due to the production of a state of circular magnetization as a result of torsional stress and longitudinal magnetism acting jointly.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
