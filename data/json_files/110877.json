He also investigates the'moist bulb problem' and the constitution of mixed gases, offering his views on Dalton's theory and arguing in favor of aqueous vapor existing in the atmosphere as a chemical solution. Additionally, the author provides methods and tables for determining heights using barometric observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
