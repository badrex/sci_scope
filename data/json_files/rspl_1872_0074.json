The author analyzes wind and temperature data from 1867 to 1870, finding that the land and sea breezes follow Halley's theory of trade-winds. The study also reveals a double diurnal variation in the general movements of the atmosphere, which is used to deduce typical wind and barometric variations in different latitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
