The study reveals that the flora and fauna in the area are similar to those found in cretaceous floras of America and differ from European Miocene age beds. The author also discusses the importance of fluviatile rocks in the British basalts and their potential age and extent.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
