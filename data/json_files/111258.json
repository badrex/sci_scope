He demonstrates how the mechanical equivalent of heat can be represented by the area enclosed between curves on a diagram of energy and discusses the efficiency of thermo-dynamic engines, including those with and without regenerators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
