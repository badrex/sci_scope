He suggests that this magnetic magma has a polar arrangement of magnetic iron-ore crystals, which align in equilibrium, creating a natural magnet. Hull also discusses the thickness, depth, and composition of this magnetic layer, as well as the implications for the Earth's poles and the secular variation of the magnetic needle.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
