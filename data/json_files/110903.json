Somerville, investigates the effects of different spectral rays on vegetable juices. She finds that the action of the spectrum is capricious, with changes in color being irregular and unaccountable. The yellow and green rays have a powerful influence on vegetable substances, while the red rays have the least effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
