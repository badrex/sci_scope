The animalcule feeds on sebaceous cell secretions and reproduces through ova. It is found in various numbers in people with different skin conditions, and its presence is not related to skin diseases. The Entozoon folliculorum has a unique structure, with a head that can retract into the thorax and a distinct abdomen. The author provides detailed descriptions of the animalcule's anatomy and behavior, as well as its method of preparation for observation under a microscope.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Microbiology"}
