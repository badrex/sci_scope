The apparatus demonstrates the principles of electrostatics and has applications in illustrating the Voltaic Theory. The author also discusses the potential and limitations of the device, as well as its similarities to self-sustaining electromagnetic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
