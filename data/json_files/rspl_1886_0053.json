The intensity of these sounds depends on the distance from the orifice and the pressure of the air. The author also explains the conditions under which an air jet reproduces different tones and the factors affecting the sound reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
