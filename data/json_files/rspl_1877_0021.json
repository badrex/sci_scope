He discovers that the attraction and repulsion of bubbles by heat depend on the type of liquid and the temperature conditions, with water bubbles being attracted and carbonic acid bubbles being repelled.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
