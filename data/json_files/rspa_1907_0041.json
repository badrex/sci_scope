They discover that heat sources, such as flames and heated objects, repel the gold leaves, while cold sources attract them. The effects are attributed to thermal radiations and radiometric forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
