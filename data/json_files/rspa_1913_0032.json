They find that equilibrium is reached when the lens and the plane surface are in tensile equilibrium, and the vapor tension of the lens and the plane surface is the same. The author also discusses the role of electrical potential and tangential viscosity in the spreading process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry"}
