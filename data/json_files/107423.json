He discovers that the negative surface becomes heated faster and attracts certain flames and gases, while the positive surface attracts others. This is due to the chemical nature of the substances involved and their electro-chemical attraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
