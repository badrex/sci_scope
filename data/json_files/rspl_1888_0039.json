They find that the change in potential is related to the chemical energy of the electrolytes and can be used as a test for the chemical composition and state of combination of dissolved substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes"}
