Pavy investigates the conversion of glycogen into sugar in the animal system and discovers that it does not occur in significant amounts when glycogen is mixed with blood and exposed to body temperature. This finding challenges the glycogenic theory and provides new insights into sugar metabolism and blood coagulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
