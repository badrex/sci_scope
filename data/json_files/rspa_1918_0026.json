The authors derive equations for bending moments and reactions, and discuss the conditions for failure and instability in various scenarios, including the effects of end thrusts and clamped supports.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Structural Engineering & Mechanics"}
