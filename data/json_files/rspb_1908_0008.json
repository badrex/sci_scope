They find that the contraction of extensor muscles occurs after the withdrawal of the external stimulus, and that the intensity and duration of the stimulus play a role in the subsequent contraction phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Neuroscience"}
