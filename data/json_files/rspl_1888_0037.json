The results show that a sudden rise in blood pressure leads to changes in the heart's rhythm and contraction force, which can impact the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular System"}
