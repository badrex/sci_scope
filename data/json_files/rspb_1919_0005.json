The authors found that the rate of absorption and the position of equilibrium are affected by the concentration of salts, providing valuable insights into plant nutrition and the mechanisms of salt intake and translocation in living plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Botany"}
