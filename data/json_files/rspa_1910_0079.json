They find that the mixtures form an ordinary-shaped freezing point curve with a minimum or eutectic point, and the supersolubility curve is determined using sealed tubes and refractive index observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
