The study reveals that stomata in many plant species partially close during the day and that environmental factors such as light, temperature, and air pressure influence stomatal movement. The findings have implications for understanding plant adaptation and resource conservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
