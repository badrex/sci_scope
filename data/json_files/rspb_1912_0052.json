The oscillations are observed in decerebrate preparations and are found to be irregular, with varying frequencies depending on the strength of the stimuli and the animal's condition. The findings suggest that nerve impulses may be subjected to conditions analogous to a stream of air passing out from a tube under water, making them more intense and infrequent in overcoming the opposing influence of inhibition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
