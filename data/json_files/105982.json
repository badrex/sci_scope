The observation was made using a telescope and a small clock, but the accuracy of the observation is uncertain due to the watch being regulated by the sun the day before. The sky was clear, and the eclipse was expected to be denser, but it appeared very thin, and the beginning was not noted.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Eclipses & Lunar Observations"}
