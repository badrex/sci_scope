The research reveals that the current density is greater near the center of the cylinder, and the average relative densities vary between different areas of the cylinder. The results provide insight into the behavior of electric currents in iron cylinders and have implications for the design of electrical devices and systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
