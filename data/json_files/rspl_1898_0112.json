The coefficients of cubical expansion exhibit a progression corresponding to the progression of the atomic weights of the three respective metals. The thermal deformation is of the nature of an expansion in all directions in the crystals of all three sulphates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography"}
