The study explores the effects of various materials and currents, concluding that the most probable cause of the torsion is the combined influence of longitudinal magnetic polarity and induced magnetism at a right angle to it, causing molecular motion and change in particle position.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
