Ritchie applies the principle of the equality of action and reaction to electromagnetism, suggesting that magnets can induce voltaic currents in certain circumstances. He shares several experiments to support the universality of this law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism"}
