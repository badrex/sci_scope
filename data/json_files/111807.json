The study suggests that the physiological destruction of sugar is similar to fermentation, with lactic acid being present in the system and molecular changes in the nitrogenized compounds playing a significant role in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Metabolism"}
