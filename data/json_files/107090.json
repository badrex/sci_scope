The theorem involves integrating the sphere's coordinates and demonstrates that the remaining solid after removing specific portions is equal to two-ninths of the cube of the sphere's diameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Calculus"}
