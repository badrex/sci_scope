The frost caused eggs to crack and liquors to turn into solid cakes of ice. The author also tested the freezing point of quicksilver in a frigorific mixture, but it remained fluid below the film on top. The sudden change in temperature led to the disappearance of an epidemic cold and the re-appearance of rheumatic affections and other diseases of the previous milder season.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
