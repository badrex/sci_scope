The author examines the variations in sunspot cycles, their lengths, and the relationship between sunspot and magnetic activity. The study finds that the sunspot and magnetic curves show a close correspondence in period and activity, suggesting a direct relation between the two phenomena or a common cause.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
