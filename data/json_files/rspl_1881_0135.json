The author deduces these formulae using a specific method and provides tables of resulting expressions. The paper highlights the importance of these formulae in the study of elliptic functions and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Number Theory & Analysis"}
