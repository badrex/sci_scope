They find that exposure to sunlight in vacuo does not cause significant retardation or destruction of the bacteria, while exposure in contact with air results in the killing of most spores. The study also reveals the importance of factors such as aeration and sunlight intensity in the bactericidal process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
