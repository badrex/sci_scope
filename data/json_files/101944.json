He suggests that these tiny organisms may be generated differently than eels and may have a role in reproduction. The author also finds various types of animalcules in different environments and speculates about their life cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Microbiology"}
