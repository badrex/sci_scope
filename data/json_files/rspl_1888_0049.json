They find that glacier ice, composed of irregularly arranged crystals, exhibits greater plasticity than regular ice crystals. This research has implications for understanding the behavior of glaciers and ice formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Cryosphere"}
