The instrument is designed to compare the difference between a standard of length and a duplicate or similar bar. It uses the principle of the author's interferometer, which involves directing homogeneous light of a definite wavelength onto two absolutely plane surfaces, causing interference and producing rectilinear dark bands. The movement of these surfaces allows for the measurement of the difference in lengths, making it a valuable tool for determining the accuracy of standards of length.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
