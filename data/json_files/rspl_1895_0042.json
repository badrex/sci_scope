They determine that platinum black contains about 110 volumes of hydrogen, with 200 volumes converted into water. The authors also observe differences in behavior when heating platinum black charged with oxygen or hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
