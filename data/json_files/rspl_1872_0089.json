They develop a compensating eyepiece and explore the effects of various optical errors on the accuracy of observations. The research also highlights the importance of accurate definition in microscopy and the potential impact of residual errors on delicate observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
