They find that the flow of sewage in a properly constructed sewer is unlikely to disperse liquid particles, but the development of gases during fermentation and putrefaction can project and suspend particles in the air for extended periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Air Quality"}
