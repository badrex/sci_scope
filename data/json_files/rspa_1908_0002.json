The process involves heating a mixture of phenylhydrazine, cupric hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide, which deposits copper onto the glass surface. The resulting copper mirrors are beautiful, with a pleasing red color and high reflectivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Surface Chemistry"}
