He demonstrates that using the cube of the square root of the density accurately represents the atmosphere, resulting in a direct equation for refraction that closely aligns with existing tables and the Nautical Almanac.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
