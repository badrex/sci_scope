The research team, led by Major Ronald Ross and David Thomson, employed the 'thick film process' and a new counting method to analyze 33 cases of malarial fever. Their findings include more accurate verifications of previous conjectures and demonstrations of new theorems related to malaria, blackwater fever, and trypanosomiasis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Pathology"}
