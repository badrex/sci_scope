The study reveals that transfer-resistance varies inversely with atomic weights of electropositive and electronegative elements in the electrolyte, and is related to surface tension and corrosion of electrodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry"}
