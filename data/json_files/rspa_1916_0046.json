Chapman and J. Larmor investigates the kinetic theory of simple and composite monatomic gases, focusing on viscosity, thermal conduction, and diffusion. They develop a method that yields results of complete formal generality and can be reduced to numerical form with comparatively little arithmetical labor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics"}
