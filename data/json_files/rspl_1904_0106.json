The study reveals that the heat production is due to the condensation of water vapour on the cotton fibres, and the observed temperature changes are significantly influenced by the initial dryness of the cotton and the surrounding conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
