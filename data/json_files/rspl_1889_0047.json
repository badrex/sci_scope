The author also examines the relationship between oxygen pressure, cellular growth, and movement, finding that a lack of oxygen is often associated with the cessation of growth and movement in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Physiology"}
