They develop a method for measuring electric currents directly, without relying on knowledge of the force of terrestrial magnetism, and determine the electrochemical equivalent of silver using silver voltameters. The results provide a convenient standard for verifying current-measuring instruments and improving the accuracy of electromotive force measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Techniques"}
