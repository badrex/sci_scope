They find that its primary structural features are comparable to an anthostrobiloid condition in Cycadeoidea, and that secondary features are a result of xerophytic specialization. The study sheds light on the plant's adaptation to its environment and its evolutionary history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
