Sch\u00f6nbein, investigates the odor accompanying electricity and its dependence on a new substrate. He observes that the odor is only released at the positive electrode during electrolysis and can be preserved in closed glass bottles. The odor is produced by gold and platinum metals and some dilute acids. Raising the temperature or adding certain substances to the odor source destroys the smell, suggesting a chemical reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrolysis"}
