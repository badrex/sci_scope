He calculates newer and older observations of magnetic declination to determine the movement of the four magnetic polar regions and attempts to explain the cause of known variations in declination, inclination, and intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
