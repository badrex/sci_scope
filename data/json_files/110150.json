The instrument consists of two hollow cylinders connected by a glass thermometer-tube, which can be used to determine the distances of equal radiation. Ritchie demonstrates the effectiveness of the instrument through experiments on iron balls and flat surfaces, concluding that the law of heat radiation is based on fact and that a constant portion of heat is radiated directly from the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics & Thermodynamics"}
