They describe the morphology of coccoliths, their variation in size, and the process of coccolith formation within the coccosphere. The study provides insights into the life history and characteristics of these microorganisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Microbiology"}
