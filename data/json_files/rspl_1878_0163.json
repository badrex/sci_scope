He discovers that a greater quantity of carbonic acid is formed in the body and exhaled at higher altitudes, suggesting that increased formation of carbonic acid may be necessary to resist the influence of cold in high-altitude regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Climatology"}
