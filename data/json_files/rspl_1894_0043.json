It concludes that the elasticity of the brain is not directly proportional to blood pressure and that venous pressure has a more significant impact on cerebral circulation than arterial pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
