The formulae derived can be used to calculate capacity coefficients and force between the conductors, providing a practical solution for engineers working with spark systems of wireless telegraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
