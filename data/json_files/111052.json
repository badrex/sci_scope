He observes that the nature and direction of the action on metals vary with the intensity of the magnetic force. The author also describes phenomena related to the magnetic and dia-magnetic states of metals and makes assumptions to explain these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
