Henry investigates the properties of tin and iodine compounds, discovering that the substance obtained by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine is a mixture of two salts. He also finds that one salt is soluble in water, while the other decomposes upon contact with water. Henry concludes that one salt is the real proto-iodide described by Boullay, and the other is a biniodide, a salt previously undescribed in detail.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
