The evidence against filtration includes the composition of dilute urine, the lack of a strict correlation between blood flow and urine secretion, and the behavior of the kidney after temporary asphyxiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
