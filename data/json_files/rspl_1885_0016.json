The study reveals the continuity of the nuclear reticulum with the extra-nuclear reticulum and the similarity in structure between the spindle fibers and the surrounding reticulum, suggesting that the nucleus and cell protoplasm differ only in the behavior of chromatin within the protoplasmic meshwork.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
