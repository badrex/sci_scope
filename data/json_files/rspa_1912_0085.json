The test uses a chromate solution and a color patch apparatus to determine the scale number of the ray, which can then be referred to a diagram to calculate the amount of green and red sensation present in the incomplete color-blind eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Perception"}
