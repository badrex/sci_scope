He reports on experiments with muriated lime and snow, which resulted in significant refrigeration. Walker also discusses different frigorific mixtures and suggests a method for obtaining transparent ice for optical purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Processes"}
