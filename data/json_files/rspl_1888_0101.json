The research focuses on determining whether renal and abdominal vascular nerves are vaso-constrictor and vaso-dilator or if the latter cannot be demonstrated. The findings reveal that the main supply of nerves for the renal vessels comes from the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th dorsal nerves, and the existence of vaso-dilator fibers is suggested.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
