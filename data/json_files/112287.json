The results show a maximum contraction of the metal about an inch above the water-line, with the effect being more pronounced in wrought iron than in other metals tested, such as cast iron, steel, zinc, tin, and gun-metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
