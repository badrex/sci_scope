{"article_id": "103015", "revised_title": "Magnetic Virtue Destruction through Wire Bending", "topics": ["Magnetism", "Iron Wire", "Magnetic Experiments", "Magnetic Virtue", "Magnetic Pole"], "tldr": "The author discovers that bending an iron wire sharply destroys its magnetic virtue, causing it to lose its inclination to either magnetic pole. This phenomenon is observed when the wire is bent and coiled, but not when it is only bent and then allowed to spring back into place. The author shares this observation with the Royal Society, hoping it may provide insight into the nature of magnetic bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
