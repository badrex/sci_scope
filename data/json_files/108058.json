He presents new tables calculated by Mr. Dessiou and discusses the discrepancies between these corrections and Bernoulli's theory. The author emphasizes the importance of further research and improvements in tidal studies for accurate predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
