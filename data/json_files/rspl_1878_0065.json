He discovers four distinct spectra: continuous, compound line, elementary line, and the spectrum at the negative pole. The study provides insights into the behavior of gases under different conditions and helps clarify the understanding of double spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
