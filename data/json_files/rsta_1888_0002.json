They find that the spectrum consists of a succession of rhythmic series, with lines becoming weaker and more distant from the more refrangible end. The authors also note a similarity in the grouping of lines to those found in the solar spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
