L. Wharton's observations on the currents and undercurrents of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus reveal a general flow of Black Sea water through the straits to the Mediterranean, influenced by N.E. winds, water temperature, and differences in specific gravities between the two seas. The study also highlights the existence of a countercurrent setting under the surface-stream, from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrography"}
