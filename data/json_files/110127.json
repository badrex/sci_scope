He found that quicklime emitted a brilliant light with 83 times the intensity of an Argand burner's flame. Drummond successfully used this method to observe distant stations in difficult conditions, such as through fog, and proposed further applications, including to lighthouses.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Surveying"}
