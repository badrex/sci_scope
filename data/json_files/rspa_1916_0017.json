They find that the main cause of broadening is the electric field of neighboring particles, rather than the movement of the luminous particle as a whole or the charge carried by the particles. The study also shows that the magnitude of the broadening decreases as the pressure decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Spectroscopy"}
