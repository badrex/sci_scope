The experiment involved using an improved apparatus and three distinct series of observations. The results showed a mean resistance of 23.612 (in units of 10^9 CGS) for the platinum-silver standard, with a resistance at 13' of 23.935 in terms of B.A. units, resulting in 1 B.A. unit equal to 0.98651 eM'th *.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena"}
