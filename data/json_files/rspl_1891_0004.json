The experiment involves measuring the attraction between two known masses and using this to calculate the mean density of the Earth. The results obtained are the gravitation constant and the mean density of the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Physics"}
