The study includes observations on the structure of muscles, the distribution of blood and nerves, and the effects of blocking blood vessels and nerves on muscle function. The author concludes that voluntary muscular motion requires both a specific muscle structure and the freedom of blood vessels and nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
