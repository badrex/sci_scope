The results show that water cannot absorb a significant amount of salt without being augmented in bulk, suggesting a reevaluation of the current understanding of salt dissolution and water's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Solutions"}
