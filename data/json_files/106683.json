The author discusses the possibility of this formation being a result of an internal action in the ovarium rather than a connection with a male, as the uterus and left ovarium were not stimulated or capable of being stimulated by the male semen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Reproductive Biology"}
