The results show that endotoxins from different bacteria induce varying degrees of changes in the opsonizing action, with some causing a marked decrease followed by an increase, while others produce a more significant rise in the opsonizing index.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
