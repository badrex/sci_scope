The data is compared with Kew Observatory's continuous records to analyze secular changes in declination, horizontal force, inclination, and vertical force. The findings indicate that the mean annual changes of declination, horizontal force, and inclination differ from Kew's values, suggesting that variations of secular change are not synchronous over the studied area.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
