He establishes a connection between the area of a spherical ellipse and the length of the spherical ellipse generated by the intersection of supplemental cones. Booth also develops properties of the spherical ellipse, showing similarities to those of plane curves and establishing a point of rational section.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
