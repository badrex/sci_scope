Through spectroscopic observations, the author distinguishes three distinct yellow colouring matters and discusses their characteristics, absorption bands, and chemical properties. The study provides insights into the relationship between these colouring matters and their potential role in the depth of colour in flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
