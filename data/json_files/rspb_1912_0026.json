They conclude that acclimatization to high altitudes is primarily due to increased secretory activity of the alveolar epithelium, increased lung ventilation, and a higher percentage of haemoglobin in the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Adaptation"}
