The process involves daily exchange of wine between the casks, with the half-filled cask heating up as the vinegar is produced. The best wine makes the best vinegar, and the process must be carefully maintained to prevent contamination and ensure proper fermentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Agriculture & Food Sciences"}
