He successfully detected heat from stars Sirius, Pollux, and Regulus, but could not make quantitative estimates of their calorific power. Huggins suggests that future research with larger telescopes could provide valuable information about the conditions of matter emitting light from different stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
