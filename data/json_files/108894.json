The number of sextactic points is determined to be equal to a specific formula involving the curve's order and other mathematical factors. The study provides a deeper understanding of the geometric and algebraic properties of plane curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
