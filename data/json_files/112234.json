The study challenges the widely accepted hypothesis that the bright lines in spectra are solely determined by the chemical nature of the substances present. The author's findings suggest that the presence of certain lines is independent of the chemical nature of electrodes or media, and that the spectra's characteristics depend on factors such as density and heating power of the discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Spectroscopy"}
