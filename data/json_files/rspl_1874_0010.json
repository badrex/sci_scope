They find that the so-called cementum is actually enamel and that the arrangement of the teeth is unique to Ophidia. The study also reveals the process of tooth formation and attachment to the jaw.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
