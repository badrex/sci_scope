The study shows that isolation at a high temperature suppresses the production of sexual forms, while crowding at a lower temperature promotes their development. This suggests that an internal factor, rather than external conditions, influences sexual reproduction in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Reproduction"}
