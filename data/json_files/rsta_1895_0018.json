They discuss the effects of temperature on the rotation and compare their findings with previous studies, concluding that their results provide a more accurate representation of the true temperature variation of the rotation in carbon bisulfide.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
