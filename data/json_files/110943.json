He finds that direct currents weaken and destroy excitability, while inverse currents preserve and increase it. The study also reveals that the effects of the current disappear more rapidly on cessation when the nerve has higher excitability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
