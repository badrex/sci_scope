The study reveals that the iron's permeability decreases over time due to a physical change, similar to the hardening process. The effect of heat and magnetic action on the iron is also explored, with the author concluding that the change is not solely due to direct magnetic action but is influenced by secondary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
