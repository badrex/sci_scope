Halley, explores the proportional heat of the sun in various latitudes and develops a method to calculate the heat collected by the sun in different regions. He concludes that the polar heat is equal to that of the sun continuing 12 hours above the horizon at a 53-degree height, which is more than the sun's elevation under the equinoctial.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate"}
