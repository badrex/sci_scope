He finds that blood can absorb oxygen from both atmospheric air and oxygen gas independently of putrefaction. The experiments suggest that the lungs' primary function is to introduce oxygen into the blood and separate carbonic acid, contributing to animal heat through the fixation of oxygen in the blood and its combinations with other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathology"}
