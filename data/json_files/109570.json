Through a series of experiments, he discovers that Palladium is actually a combination of Platinum and Mercury, and not a new, simple metal. The specific gravity of this alloy is lower than expected, which raises questions about the accuracy of specific gravity measurements in determining the composition of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
