The author explains how the arc's behavior can be understood through the formation of a thin layer of vapor, a bulb mist, and a sheath of gases surrounding the arc. The study also highlights the influence of the arc's length, current, and the properties of the materials involved on its overall behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry"}
