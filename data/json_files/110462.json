Through experiments, he demonstrates that venous blood does contain carbonic acid and that it is extracted by atmospheric air. He also presents a theory of respiration, stating that the blood undergoes a change in the capillary system, forming carbonic acid and evolving heat. The bright red color of arterial blood is attributed to the action of saline ingredients in the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
