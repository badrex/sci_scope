They find that the error is due to surface tension differences between water and chloroform-benzol mixtures, causing hydrometers to show a higher specific gravity than the actual value.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Clinical Chemistry & Laboratory Medicine"}
