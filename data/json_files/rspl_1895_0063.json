The stars are found to be increasing in temperature and are believed to be meteor-swarms not yet fully condensed. The study also reveals that there is a general weakening of the continuous spectrum as the light of the star decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Celestial Mechanics"}
