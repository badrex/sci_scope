The study focuses on the efficiency of steam engines, the role of steam jackets, and the impact of liquefaction on engine performance. The author also provides exact formulae for the action of steam in jacketed cylinders and demonstrates their application to real-world steam vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Thermodynamics"}
