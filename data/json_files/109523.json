The lamb's cerebrum and nerves are absent, leading to the inference that brain sensation does not influence growth in the uterus. Further study of such cases could lead to significant discoveries in the field of physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
