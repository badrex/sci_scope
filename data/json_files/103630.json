The method is then applied to record rainfall data from April 1, 1722, to April 1, 1723, in Widdrington, Northumberland. The results show that some summer months were very wet, while some winter months were very dry, with the overall rainfall being close to the mean quantity of rain at Upminster, Paris, and Lisle.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
