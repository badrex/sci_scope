Brown S\u00e8quard's research investigates the effect of different parts of the solar spectrum on the iris and pupil constriction. He found that the yellow part of the spectrum had the most significant effect, while the other colors had little to no impact. This suggests that light's ability to stimulate the iris is due to a 'peculiar dynamical influence' rather than chemical or calorific properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Vision Science"}
