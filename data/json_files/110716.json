The clock relies on an electro-magnet and a constant voltaic battery to create and break the circuit periodically, enabling synchronization with other electro-magnetic instruments. Wheatstone also discusses alternative methods, such as using Faraday's magneto-electric currents, and modifications to improve the device's performance at greater distances.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications"}
