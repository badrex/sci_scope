They demonstrate that when there is discontinuity in the tendency to compression in a material system, all the consequences of collision can occur, including the instantaneous transmission of a finite amount of momentum from one part of the system to another.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
