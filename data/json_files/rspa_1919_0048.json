The experiments reveal that about half the current in the tube is brought up to the cathode by positively charged particles with sufficient velocity to pass through the slit. The results also suggest that the current density on the cathode surface is not solely determined by the total current passing through the tube.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Discharge & Plasma Physics"}
