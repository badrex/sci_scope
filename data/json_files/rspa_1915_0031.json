The results reveal that the pressure on the lee side of the obstacle varies during different phases of water oscillation, providing evidence for the formation of vortices and the influence of local pressure differences on water flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Hydrology"}
