The gyroscope consists of a beam that can rotate around a horizontal axis, which is itself moveable around a vertical axis. A rotating disc at one end of the beam exhibits various phenomena when the equilibrium is disturbed, such as the beam moving in different directions. The author also discusses the influence of the axis of rotation and the role of friction in the device's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Physics"}
