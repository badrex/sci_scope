Thomson and J. P. Joule investigates the thermal effects of fluids in motion, specifically focusing on the changes in temperature experienced by objects moving through the air. They explore various experiments and findings, including the relationship between velocity and thermal effects, and the impact of different materials and positions of the whirled objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
