They use a dropping pipette to measure surface tension and concentration, finding that the concentration at the interface is significantly higher than in the bulk solution, supporting Gibbs' theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry"}
