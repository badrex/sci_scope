Observations made on the Midland Railway telegraph revealed simultaneous deflections in the four main lines, suggesting a connection between the direction of the electric current and the magnetic needle. Experiments showed a regular diurnal alternation in the electric current, with the deflection direction corresponding to easterly or westerly magnetic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
