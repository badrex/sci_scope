He estimates that a single drop of water can contain thousands of these tiny organisms. He also notes that these creatures can survive in distilled and boiled water, and that they reappear after the water has been warmed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
