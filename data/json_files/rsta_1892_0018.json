The author aims to develop a single application of dynamical reasoning to derive all of Maxwell's equations and demonstrate the relationship between electrostatics, electrodynamics, magnetism, and electromagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
