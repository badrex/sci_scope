It explores the relationships between quadrics, their discriminants, and the determination of their linear factors. The article also discusses the concepts of harmonic relation, involution, and syzygetic relations between three quadrics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
