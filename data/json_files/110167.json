The method involves creating alloys of gold, silver, and platinum in varying proportions, with each alloy representing a specific temperature range. Prinsep also discusses the accuracy of his method and its potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
