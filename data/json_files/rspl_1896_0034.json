They demonstrate that the demagnetization of magnetized steel needles can be used to detect and compare high-frequency alternating currents. The research also explores the detection of electrical waves at long distances, waves along wires, damping of oscillations, resistances of iron wires, absorption of energy by conductors, and determining the period of oscillation of Leyden jar discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Waves"}
