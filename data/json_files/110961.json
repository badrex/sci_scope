He describes experiments using a frog's isolated nerves and muscles, observing spasmodic contractions and tetanoid rigidity after discontinuing the voltaic current. Hall concludes that the phenomena involve a yet-to-be fully investigated voltaic principle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
