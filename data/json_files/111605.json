Bunsen and Henry Enfield Roscoe, develop a method for measuring the chemical action of light using a flame of carbonic oxide gas and a sensitive mixture of chlorine and hydrogen. They establish a standard for comparing the chemical action of light and investigate the chemical action of direct and diffuse sunlight. The authors also introduce the concept of a \"chemical unit of light\" and explore the chemical brightness of the sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
