He presents experiments and discusses alternative hypotheses on the nature of these substances, ultimately concluding that potassium and sodium are not compounds of potash and soda with hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
