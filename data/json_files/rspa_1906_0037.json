The study explores the effects of tidal friction, angular momentum, and the deformation of the satellite's shape on its stability and figure. The findings suggest that certain configurations of liquid satellites are unstable and can lead to the formation of two separate bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics"}
