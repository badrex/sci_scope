He describes how the birds were retrieved by local boys and their revival after being warmed by their captors. This observation supports the idea that some swallows stay behind in these \"dormitories\" during winter, while others migrate away.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ornithology & Bird Behavior"}
