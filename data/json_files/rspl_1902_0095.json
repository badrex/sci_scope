The author presents a theory of sterilization in the sporophyte and explores the variations in the number of sporangia in vascular plants. The study concludes that the complexity of spore-producing parts in plants can be traced back to modifications of a radial strobiloid type.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Botany"}
