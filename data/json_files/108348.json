They find that induced contractions are exclusive to the muscle in contraction and that the turpentine coating does not affect the electric discharge. The author concludes that further research is needed to understand the relationship between induced contractions and electric discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
