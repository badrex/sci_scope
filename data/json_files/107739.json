The teeth of this herbivorous reptile are distinct from other known reptiles and are compared to those of the recent iguana. The Iguanodon's teeth and some bones found in the sandstone are similar to those of the crocodile, megalosaurus, and plesiosaurus, suggesting that they may have inhabited rivers or freshwater lakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Fossil Studies"}
