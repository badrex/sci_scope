Poynting and Lord Rayleigh investigates the transfer of energy in electromagnetic fields using Maxwell's equations. They develop a theorem that explains how energy moves through a field, accounting for the energy's transformation into electric and magnetic forms, as well as heat generated in conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
