They find that the rhythm of muscular response remains constant and independent of the excitation rate, approximately ten per second. This research provides insights into the normal rate of discharge of nervous impulses and the process of summation within nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
