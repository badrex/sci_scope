They develop an apparatus to measure these phenomena and find that the ionization produced in the gas is proportional to the pressure of the gas, while the energy of the penetrating secondary radiation is also simply proportional to the pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physics of Radiation & X-rays"}
