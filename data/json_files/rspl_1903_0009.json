They discover that the toxine is carried to the central nervous system through motor nerves and demonstrate the existence of tetanus dolorosus, a form of tetanus confined to the sensory system. They also provide insights into the period of incubation, the action of tetanus toxine, and the effectiveness of serum treatment for tetanus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
