The results indicate that an electric current is produced during contraction, which cannot be entirely attributed to secondary actions. The author suggests that further research is needed to understand the nature of this residual effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
