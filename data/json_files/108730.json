Walker, investigates the disturbances in telegraph needles caused by magnetic storms and earth-currents. He observes that these disturbances are connected to the appearance of the aurora borealis and tracks their impact on telegraph systems. Walker's observations led to improvements in telegraph technology to better handle these disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Geophysics"}
