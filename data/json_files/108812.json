They find that the Earth's rigidity is crucial in determining the deformation of its figure under the influence of lunar and solar forces, and that the actual tidal tendency is greater than if the Earth were perfectly rigid.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
