He identifies a principal line that matches the nitrogen line found in nebulae by Mr. Huggins. The study highlights the variable nature of the lightning spectrum, with varying relative intensities between the continuous and linear spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
