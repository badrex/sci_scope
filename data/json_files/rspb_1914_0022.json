It finds that anterior regeneration is dependent on the presence of the central nervous system, while posterior regeneration can occur independently. The research also explores the regeneration of the nervous system and the formation of heteromorphic forms in the species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
