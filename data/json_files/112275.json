He demonstrates the transformation of diazoamidobenzol into a new compound, nitrate of diazobenzol, and discusses the properties and reactions of this substance. Griess also discusses the formation of new compounds from nitrate of benzidine and nitrate of naphthylamin, as well as their decomposition products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Compounds"}
