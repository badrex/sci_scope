The study reveals precise measurements of magnetic elements, diurnal and annual fluctuations, and a new department of science related to magnetic action. The findings also establish a connection between the sun's physical constitution, solar spots, and the Aurora Borealis with the periodicity of magnetic fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
