The study shows that paralyzed muscles can be stimulated to contract using direct electrical current, and that the intensity and polarity of the current affect the muscle's response. The research also demonstrates the potential for electrical stimulation as a treatment for muscle paralysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurology & Rehabilitation"}
