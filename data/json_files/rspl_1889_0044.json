During the first period, a great loss of voltaic energy occurs, forming hydrochloric, hypochlorous, and chloric acids. In the second period, a slow increase in voltaic energy takes place, leading to the formation of peroxide of hydrogen and a'solution compound' represented by the formula 2HCl, H2O2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Mechanisms"}
