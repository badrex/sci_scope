They describe their experimental setup, methodology, and the accurate measurement of the spectra using a diffraction grating and photography. This work provides a foundation for further research in spectroscopy and the analysis of absorption and emission spectra of organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
