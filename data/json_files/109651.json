He discovers new substances, the bases of potash and soda, which have unique properties and affinities for oxygen. These findings expand our understanding of chemical changes and the nature of alkaline bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
