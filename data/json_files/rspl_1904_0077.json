He discovers that the emanations cause a superficial darkening of the diamond, converting the surface into graphite, and alter the body color of the stone. The study also reveals that the alteration of color may be due to a combination of physical and chemical actions, which could have commercial implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Material Science & Nanotechnology"}
