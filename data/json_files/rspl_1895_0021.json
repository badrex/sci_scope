Walker summarizes the geodetic operations in India, focusing on the Great Trigonometrical Survey and the influence of local deflections on the plumb line. The author discusses the discrepancies between astronomical and geodetic determinations and suggests combining astronomical observations in groups to eliminate errors caused by deflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Surveying"}
