He finds that the impressions made in soft bodies are proportional to the square of the velocity, while the impressions in pulverized clay and brick-dust are closer to being proportional to the velocity itself. The author suggests that this difference is due to the degree of cohesion in the soft bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Dynamics"}
