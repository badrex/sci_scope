They explore the impact of different stimuli on the retina and discuss the limitations of the Young-Helmholtz theory. The experiments conducted reveal that the contrast effect can be powerful even when the second stimulus does not directly affect the retinal area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Psychology"}
