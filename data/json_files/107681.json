The appearance was a luminous spot on the dark part of the moon, which seemed like a star of the sixth magnitude, and three others much smaller. The largest spot was surrounded by a nebulous appearance. Fallows looks forward to observing the phenomenon again when the sky is clear.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Lunar Studies"}
