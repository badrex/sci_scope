The study suggests that the supposed cycle of rainfall in Madras does not align with the sun-spot cycle, and the mean differences between the observations and the calculated means do not support the claim of a definite periodicity in rainfall.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
