Tenon", "topics": ["Pumps", "Wate", "Mechanical Engineering", "Innovations", "Hydraulic Systems"], "tldr": "W. Tenon presents an alternative design for Dr. Papin's water engine, suggesting a modification to the existing design that utilizes a cylindrical vessel, pipes, and bladders to create a perpetual pumping motion. The improved water engine would continuously pump water into the inner vessel and force air out through pipes, creating a steady stream of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Machines"}
