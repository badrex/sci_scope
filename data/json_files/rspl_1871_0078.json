The study provides evidence for the existence of a 26-day period in the Earth's magnetic force, which could have implications for understanding the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geophysics"}
