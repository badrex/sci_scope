Piazzi Smyth, describes an equatorial instrument designed to measure the right ascension and declination of the apex of the Zodiacal Light. He found the phenomenon to be more stable and determinate than previously represented, with a probable error of not more than 2\u00b0. Smyth encourages other observers in favorable positions to continue the study and shares a series of views of the Zodiacal Light's appearances at different times of the year.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomical Techniques & Methods"}
