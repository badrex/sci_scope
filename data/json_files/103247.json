Hauksbee describes an experiment in which he attempts to maintain multiple atmospheres of air within a single space. He discovers that the air's constituent parts do not fully restore themselves after being compressed, and speculates that this could lead to surprising discoveries, such as supporting thin glass bubbles in an invisible medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
