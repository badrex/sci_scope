The study reveals the importance of molecular strain in modifying chemical activity and the potential for physical strain to produce photographic effects. The research also highlights the role of sensitization in preventing self-recovery and making after-effects more permanent.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry"}
