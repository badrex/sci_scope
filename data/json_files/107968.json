The study reveals that the sleep of hybernating animals varies from ordinary sleep, with a more impaired state of respiration and heat evolution, and increased ability to withstand the absence of atmospheric air.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Behavior"}
