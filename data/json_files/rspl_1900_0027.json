They find that the mean mechanical equivalent of heat is 4.37 Joules per calorie, with a thermal capacity of water varying between 1.00 and 1.42 calories per gram between freezing and boiling points.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Calorimetry"}
