He improves the mathematical formulas representing tidal inequalities and verifies the general form of corrections for lunar parallax and declination. Whewell suggests a simple theory of tides based on equilibrium positions and introduces the concept of retroposition in longitude and time. The study's findings can be applied to understanding tides at other locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
