Halley's Table of Refractions", "Trigonometry", "Star Distances"], "tldr": "Dr. Edm. Halley discusses the impact of air refraction on astronomical observations and presents a table to help account for the effect of refraction on the apparent distances of stars. He explains that the refraction of the air causes the distances of stars to appear smaller than their true distances, and this effect is more pronounced for stars closer to the horizon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeodesy & Celestial Mechanics"}
