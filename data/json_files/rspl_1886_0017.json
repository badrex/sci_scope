They find that magnetization causes iron rods to elongate, while steel and nickel rods exhibit temporary retraction and elongation, respectively. The study also highlights the influence of the metal's temper and tension on these changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
