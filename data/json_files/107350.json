The survey involves collecting specimens of various rock types and estimating the quantity and position of each type relative to the observatories on the mountain. The findings contribute to understanding the mean density of the earth and the attraction of the mountain.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
