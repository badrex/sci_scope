Groombridge investigates the impact of atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations using a transit circle. He finds that the mean refraction is actually 58 minutes and a small fraction, and that the law of refraction at different altitudes needs to be adjusted. Groombridge's findings are compared with other astronomers' results, highlighting the need for more accurate refraction calculations in astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
