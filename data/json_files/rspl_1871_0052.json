They describe various processes, including heterogenetic biocrasis, and the role of temperature in the development of these organisms. The study provides insight into the complex interactions and transformations of microorganisms in their natural environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microbial Evolution"}
