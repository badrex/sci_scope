They find that the remaining charge after explosive discharge is not due to spreading on the glass or penetration into its substance, but rather an undischarged portion of the accumulation. The author also introduces a new form of the discharging electrometer and discusses the intensity and tension of electrical force in relation to these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena"}
