They discover that the expansion behavior is influenced by the salt concentration and can be classified as an osmotic process. The findings suggest that shellac derivatives exhibit unique properties compared to other substances like gelatine and gum tragacanth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Polymers"}
