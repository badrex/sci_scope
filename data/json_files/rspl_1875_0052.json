They use a radiometer, or light-mill, to study the mechanical action of light sources on these bodies and find that the force acting on the vessel enclosing the light-mill is equal and opposite to that acting on the mill itself. The pressure exerted by light is found to be equal to the weight of a film of water on a horizontal surface equal in thickness to the length of a wave of violet light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
