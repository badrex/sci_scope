The skeleton is incomplete, with the skull and some vertebrae missing, and the bones appear to have been damaged after their deposition. The surrounding rock is composed of calcareous sand, with shells and other marine life fragments found nearby. The author speculates on the possible age of the skeleton but cannot definitively determine it due to limited geological knowledge of the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Evolution & Paleoanthropology"}
