The author discusses the various factors involved in the transit, including the time of the event, the equation of natural days, the geocentric latitude of Mercury, and the angle of the apparent way of the transit with the ecliptic. The author also compares this transit with the one that occurred on October 24, 1697, and examines the differences between computation and observation to improve the accuracy of future calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics"}
