The study reveals the presence of substances like free cholesterol, cadaverine, putrescine, and aminovaleric acid in the ethereal extract, suggesting alternative sources for the increase in fat content during ripening.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Food Chemistry"}
