The study reveals the true homologies of teeth in Marsupialia, clarifying the confusion caused by superficial resemblances to teeth of Carnivora and other Placentals. The research also traces the history of mammalian tooth evolution, suggesting that the process of milk tooth development involved two stages: preliminary retardation of the permanent tooth and the development of a temporary tooth in the gap caused by the retardation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mammalogy & Vertebrate Zoology"}
