The method is based on the oscillation of a horizontal disc in the liquid and can be used for temperatures up to 1200\u00b0C. The main challenge in this method is preventing surface oxidation of metals, which can spoil the observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
