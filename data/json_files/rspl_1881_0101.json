The author finds that the conductivity is lowest when the glass is an exact chemical compound and that the conductivity may increase with time. The study also reveals a marked connection between electric conductivity and density in lead or flint glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
