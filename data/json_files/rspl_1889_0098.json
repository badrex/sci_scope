The author finds that adding material above and below a section can increase the bar's resistance to shearing stress, and that the resistance to direct shearing is approximately half the resistance to direct tension. The appearance of steel bar fractures is also discussed, revealing that fractures occur along planes of least resistance to shear when stress is uniformly distributed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
