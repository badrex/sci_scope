The study reveals that the observed effects of lunar and solar parallax and declination can be accurately represented by the theoretical formula, providing valuable insights into the behavior of tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
