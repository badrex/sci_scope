The Zariffa's stomach has four cavities, with the second cavity lacking the cellular structure found in other ruminants. The cud formed from the Zariffa's natural diet of acacia leaves and twigs is so succulent that it does not require additional moisture in the second stomach, unlike grass-eating animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
