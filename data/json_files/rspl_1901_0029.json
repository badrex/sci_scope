Comparing the star's spectrum with other Novae and stars like a Cygni, the author concludes that the enhanced lines of iron are present in the Nova Persei spectrum, suggesting a connection between the Novae and the enhanced lines of certain substances in other stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Cosmology"}
