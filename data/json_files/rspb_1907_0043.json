The study demonstrates that heated serum exerts a marked inhibitory action on the opsonins of fresh normal serum, suggesting the presence of opsonic amboceptors in normal serum that inhibit phagocytosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
