The author uses a steam calorimeter to measure the thermal capacity of the gases, finding that the method is accurate and consistent, with potential for further improvements in future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
