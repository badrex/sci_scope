The organism is a large, straight or slightly curved bacillus that prefers acidic media and behaves differently in the presence of carbohydrates. It is a facultative anaerobe and has various growth characteristics, including spore formation, motility, and involution forms. The bacillus is non-pathogenic and has similarities to other well-known species but cannot be accurately referred to any specific species at present.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
