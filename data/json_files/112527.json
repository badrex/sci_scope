The author provides additional details and more accurate figures to describe the muscular coat of the veins of the bat's wing and compares it to the muscular coat of arteries. The study also investigates the microscopical characters of the lymphatic hearts of the frog and the caudal heart of the eel, finding similarities and differences with other rhythmically contractile tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
