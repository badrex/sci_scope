The research shows that the emissivity increases with decreasing wire diameter and rising temperature, affecting the loss of heat from thin wires and having implications for electrical engineering applications such as glow lamps, hot-wire voltmeters, and fuses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
