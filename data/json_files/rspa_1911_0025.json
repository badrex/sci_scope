They measure the energy, absorption coefficients, and corpuscular emission of the radiation, providing insights into the dependence of these properties on the nature of the anticathode and the velocity of the parent cathode rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
