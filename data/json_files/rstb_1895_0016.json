The authors analyze the structure and organization of the roots, including their lacunar cortex, absence of nodes, solid pith, and lack of canals accompanying vascular bundles, to establish their morphological nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
