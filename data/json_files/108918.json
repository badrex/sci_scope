Bashforth, investigates the resistance of air to elongated projectiles with variously formed heads, finding that the resistance increases as the cube of the velocity. He develops a chronograph to measure the time occupied by a projectile in passing over successive equal spaces, providing a more accurate method for determining air resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
