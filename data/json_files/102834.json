He discusses the arguments of other antiquaries, such as William Camden, and presents new evidence from the discovery of strange teeth and bones in the form of a well in Chartham. Wallis suggests that the isthmus was worn away by the sea over time, leading to the current narrow passage between Dover and Calais.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geomorphology"}
