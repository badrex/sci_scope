The observations were compared with the Variation Chart published in 1756 and showed a considerable increase in variation near the coast of Portugal, Cape Saint Vincent, and around Gibraltar. The author suggests that these changes may be due to local attractions in the West Indies and recommends further investigation into the cause of these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
