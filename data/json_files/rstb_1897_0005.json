The study aims to understand the degree to which certain movements are represented in specific segments and the relationship between the representation of one movement and another. The research focuses on the dog and monkey species, using electric stimulation to observe resulting movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
