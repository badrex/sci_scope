The author identifies the cause as pyrites, marcasites, and other minerals in the cliffs, which ignite when exposed to air, water, and the electrical charge of lightning. The author suggests that subterranean fires, hot springs, and even earthquakes may be caused by the same process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Mineralogy"}
