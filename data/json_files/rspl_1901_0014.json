The author calculates the magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constant, and electrical conductivity, and discusses the optical control, dispersion, and polarization effects. The results are compared to experimental observations and other theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
