They find that the grains consist of a water-soluble proteid (hemialbumose) and another proteid that is insoluble in distilled water but soluble in 10% sodium acetate solution. The findings suggest that these grains have varying degrees of complexity in their composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Biochemistry"}
