They derive formulas for the magnetic potential and induced current-function, and discuss the specific case of a disk rotating in a uniform field. The results have implications for understanding the behavior of electrical currents in various systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields"}
