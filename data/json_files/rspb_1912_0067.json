The results show that ricinus lipase, emulsin, and autolysed yeast-juice have varying degrees of hydrolytic action on hexosephosphate, while autolysed ox pancreas and zymin extract have little to no action. An alcohol-ether precipitation of autolysed yeast-juice also demonstrates significant activity towards hexosephosphate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
