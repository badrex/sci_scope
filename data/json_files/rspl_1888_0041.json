It examines the structure, development, and evolutionary implications of the electric organ in R. radiata, which is smaller and less complex than that of R. circularis. The research suggests that the electric organ in R. radiata is in a state of progressive development, despite its small size and apparent uselessness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Comparative Anatomy"}
