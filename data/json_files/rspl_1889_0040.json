The experiments conducted on various mountains and the Rigi Staffel provide evidence that altitude affects respiration, with an increased expiration of carbon dioxide at higher altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Respiration"}
