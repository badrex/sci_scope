Through a series of experiments, he demonstrates that pressure can induce a uniaxial double refraction in the molecules, and discusses the implications for the origin and general phenomena of double refraction in regular crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Crystallography"}
