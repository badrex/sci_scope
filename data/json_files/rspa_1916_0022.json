They find that changing the speed of the tests significantly affects the range of non-elastic strain, with slower speeds leading to increased strain and faster speeds leading to decreased strain. The results suggest that the main factors affecting the alteration of non-elastic strain are variation in mobility in the steel and the speed of the cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
