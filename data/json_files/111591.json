He also observes that the insulating power of a substance is greater in proportion to its degree of polarization and that the electric capacity of a conducting body is higher when surrounded by insulating substances like sulphur.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
