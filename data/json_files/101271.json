They conclude that the deficiency of vision is likely due to the varying magnitudes of the optic nerve in different eyes, and question whether vision is made in the retina or the choroid layer of the eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Vision Science"}
