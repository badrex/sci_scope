This hypothesis suggests that electro-negative and electro-positive atoms have different electron pathways, and that the formation of molecules, such as hydrogen, can be explained by the interaction of these electron pathways.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Molecular & Atomic Chemistry"}
