He argues that the incipient chorda dorsalis is the last-formed row of cells and is not the \"axis around which the first parts of the foetus form\" as Von Baer suggested. Barry also discusses the role of the nucleus of a cell in the development of the embryo and its implications for understanding the origin of the embryo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
