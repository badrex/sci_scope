The study shows that the observed deviations from the average size of each organ cluster symmetrically around the mean value, and the degree of correlation between organs is consistent across both samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
