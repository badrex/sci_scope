He finds that steel is closer to copper in thermo-electric position, and that cast iron surpasses copper. Joule also discovers that stretching a solid body causes a decrease in temperature when the stretching weight is applied and an increase in temperature when the weight is removed. This study confirms Professor Thomson's theoretical investigations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
