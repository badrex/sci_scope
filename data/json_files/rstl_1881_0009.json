The study considers the effects of tidal friction on the configuration and rotation of the planet, as well as the orbital dynamics of the satellites. The findings suggest that tidal friction plays a significant role in the evolution of planetary masses and the overall stability of the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Astronomy"}
