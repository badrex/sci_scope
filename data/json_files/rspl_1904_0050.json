They develop a method to measure the volume of emanation and helium produced from a known weight of radium bromide and find that the emanation from thorium is chemically inert, similar to the members of the argon family.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry"}
