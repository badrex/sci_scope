By examining the specific gravities of gold and silver, the author concludes that the thickness of the gold layer is extremely thin, and that a single grain of gold can cover 98 yards of wire. This finding supports the atomic theory and the notion that gold atoms are very small.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic Theory & Materials Science"}
