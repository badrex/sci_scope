W. Johnston, examines pigotite, a substance found in caves on the east and west coast of Cornwall. He identifies two organic acids, mudesous and mudesic, and their compounds with alumina. The study provides insights into the formation of pigotite and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Mineralogy"}
