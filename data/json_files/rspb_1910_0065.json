The endotoxins were found to inhibit phagocytosis, and the new method demonstrated specificity between closely related organisms, such as the typhoid-paratyphoid group. The endotoxins were also found to be thermostable, maintaining their ability to exert their specific action even after exposure to high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Immunology"}
