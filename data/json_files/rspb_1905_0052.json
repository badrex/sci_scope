They find that glucose can exist in two stereoisomeric forms, and that enzymes selectively act on these forms, leading to the formation of different products. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of enzyme action and the role of stereochemistry in biochemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
