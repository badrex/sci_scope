Child conducted twenty experiments on spontaneous generation using milk and meat samples in various gas atmospheres. The results showed that low organisms were found in most cases, except when using nitrogen gas or boiled substances. The study highlights the importance of the gas atmosphere and temperature in the development of microbial life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microbial Ecology"}
