These specimens display various features such as teeth and tubercles, suggesting they may belong to a previously unknown species. The author speculates that these fossils could be the remains of a fish-like or reptilian animal, providing insight into the diverse marine and terrestrial life forms that existed in the past.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth & Environmental Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Fossil Record"}
