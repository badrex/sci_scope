They recommend using copper wires and placing the apparatus outside the building to prevent lightning from entering. They also suggest increasing the number of lightning protection systems and adapting them for powder magazines by detaching them from the building and placing them near the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Lightning Protection"}
