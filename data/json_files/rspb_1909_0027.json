The results show that heat causes currents in the tissues that are opposite to the currents caused by electrical or mechanical excitation. This study provides insight into the physiological responses to heat and the underlying mechanisms of tissue electrical activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Biophysics"}
