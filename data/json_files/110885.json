Baden Powell, investigates the elliptic polarization of light by reflecting it off metallic surfaces. He explores the effects of varying the inclination of incident rays, the position of the plane of analysis, and the use of different metals as reflecting surfaces. The study employs the undulatory theory of light and includes a description of a unique polariscope used in the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
