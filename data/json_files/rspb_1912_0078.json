The study reveals that the apparent dissociation of these processes in earlier stages of narcosis may be illusory, and that both conductivity and excitability are affected by narcotics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
