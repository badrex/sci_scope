The authors discuss various experiments and observations that support or challenge the 'all or none' theory, concluding that further research is needed to fully understand the complexity of neuronal activity and reflex responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
