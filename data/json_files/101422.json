The mineral is similar to lead ore and is mined in underground tunnels. Brimstone is extracted by heating the ore in clay crucibles and collecting the melted sulfur, while vitriol is produced by boiling the ash from the ore with water and allowing it to cool and separate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
