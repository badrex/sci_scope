The study aims to determine the mean temperature of every day in the year and identify patterns and anomalies in temperature distribution. The findings reveal significant variations in temperature throughout the year, with notable periods of increase and decrease, and provide insights into the challenges of assigning physical causes for these temperature fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
