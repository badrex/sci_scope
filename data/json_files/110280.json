The device can be applied to control dampers, letting in cold air or water, or closing fireplace draughts, and is proposed for use in regulating safety valves of steam boilers.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Thermodynamics"}
