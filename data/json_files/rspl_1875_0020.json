They discover that on calm days with a downward temperature gradient, sound can travel further due to increased refraction, allowing distant sounds to be heard more clearly.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
