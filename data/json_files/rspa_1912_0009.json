The results show that the current varies inversely with the cube of the distance between the plates and is proportional to the square of the potential difference, confirming the applicability of Rutherford's equation for the current between two plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
