The study reveals that the deflections are influenced by the position of the needle and the iron shell, and provides insights into the distribution of magnetism and the underlying principles of magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
