A. Claudet investigates the focus adjustment in the Daguerreotype process and discovers that the focus of photogenic rays is not coincident with the visual focus in achromatic object-glasses. By adjusting the focus according to the nature of the lens and the intensity of light, the author achieves perfect delineations of objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
