The crane features a horizontal wheel with an upright axle, three trundles with different numbers of staves, and a winch for turning the trundles. The design allows for different power levels depending on the weight being lifted, ensuring a safer and more efficient lifting experience.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Design"}
