He demonstrates the ability to generate electricity using a helix and the Earth's magnetic field, and explores the potential for using this method to indicate disturbances in magnetic forces. Faraday also discusses the evolution of electricity by means of the magnetism of the globe and the possibility of using the Earth's magnetic field to create electrical currents without the use of ferruginous materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
