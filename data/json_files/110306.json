The author, William Whewell, and John William Lubbock analyze the complex calculations required to determine the magnitude and period of this inequality, drawing comparisons to previous investigations of similar phenomena in the planetary system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics"}
