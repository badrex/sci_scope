The findings suggest that the laws regulating the effects on voluntary and involuntary muscles are different, and that mechanical and chemical stimuli have varying impacts on these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
