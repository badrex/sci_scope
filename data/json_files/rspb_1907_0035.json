They also find that the opsonic power of both normal and immune serum decreases rapidly upon heating, suggesting the involvement of a thermostable substance and a thermolabile factor in the sensitizing action of serum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
