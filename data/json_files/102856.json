He discusses the methods used by ancient and modern astronomers to measure the Earth's dimensions and the possibility of the Earth being flattened at the poles or having an elliptical shape. The author also mentions the observations of the inequality of degrees in the meridian line, which could challenge the Earth's perfect roundness.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
