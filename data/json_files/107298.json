The method involves slow combustion and the use of oxygen gas to determine the composition of the gases. The author also discusses the limitations of the current methods and proposes a new process for decomposition of the gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
