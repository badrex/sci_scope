They observe the presence of various spectral lines, including those of sodium, calcium, and iron, and discuss the possible sources of these lines. The study also explores the effects of introducing different substances and compounds into the explosion chamber.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
