The author discusses the importance of adopting the same scale values for similar instruments at different observatories and presents tables of simultaneous disturbances, reduced to Greenwich mean time. The author also attempts to apply Gaussian analysis to sudden magnetic disturbances and provides the values of the Gaussian functions for 20 different observatories.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
