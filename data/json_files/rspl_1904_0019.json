Through a series of experiments, Massee concludes that chemotaxis plays a significant role in this process, with certain substances in the plant's cell-sap attracting or repelling fungal growth. This research demonstrates that parasitism in fungi is an acquired habit and can be influenced by environmental factors such as turgidity and the presence of chemotactic substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Pathology & Mycology"}
