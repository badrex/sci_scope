They discover that the electrification of air by drops of water or bubbles through water is a significant factor in indoor experiments and can be tested using different methods. The authors also explore the properties of cathode rays and their differences from ortho-cathodic and para-cathodic rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
