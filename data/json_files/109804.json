He discovers that the peculiar phenomena of mother-of-pearl are due to a specific configuration of its surface, which consists of grooves that affect the axis of extraordinary reflection. Brewster also finds that the colors seen in mother-of-pearl depend on its thickness and that it polarizes light in a unique way compared to other crystallized bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
