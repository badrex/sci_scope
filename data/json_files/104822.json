He examines the stones' composition, shape, and texture, and conducts experiments to determine their specific gravity and chemical makeup. The author concludes that these stones are primarily composed of earth, volatile alkaline salts, water, oil, and a small amount of air, and that their composition is more similar to deer horn than human calculi.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Veterinary Medicine & Animal Health"}
