Echidna and Ornithorhyncus exhibit different methods of heat regulation, while marsupials show evidence of utilizing variations in heat loss. The development of mechanisms controlling heat production and loss has allowed warm-blooded animals to adapt to a wider range of temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Developmental Biology"}
