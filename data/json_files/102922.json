He observes that sea water particles can be carried far inland during a storm and can cause damage to windows and other structures. Using a microscope, he examines the salt particles in the water and concludes that they can be beneficial to the soil, potentially increasing its fertility.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
