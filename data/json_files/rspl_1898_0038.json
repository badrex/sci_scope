Gotch and G. J. Burch, successfully measure the electromotive changes in nerve response to a single stimulus using a capillary electrometer. They provide detailed descriptions of their experimental setup and findings, including the effects of different stimulus intensities and the role of the electrometer contacts' positions on the nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
