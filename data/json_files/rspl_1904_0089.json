The authors also compare the venoms' antagonism with Calmette's serum and their effects on the respiratory mechanism and cardiac function. The results show that Enhydrina venom is the most lethal substance, with a direct action on the respiratory center and no direct action on the heart or arterioles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Toxicology & Venoms"}
