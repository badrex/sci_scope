These particles grow and increase over time, suggesting that mineral earths may grow and increase in a similar manner. The experiment also demonstrates the abundance of nitrous particles in the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
