The author also investigates the local attraction at Arthur's Seat and the Royal Observatory at Edinburgh. The study finds that the unequal distribution of matter in the vicinity of these stations, such as the Firth of Forth and the Pentland Hills, causes the deflection. The paper concludes with the statement of the principal results, including the effect of the attraction of the Pentland Hills, the calculated attractions of the mass of Arthur's Seat, and the mean density of the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
