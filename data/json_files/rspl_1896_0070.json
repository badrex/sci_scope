The study reveals that the gases are likely a result of the rocks being crystallized in an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and steam, in contact with easily oxidizable substances at moderately high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Mineralogy"}
