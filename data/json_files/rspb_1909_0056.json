The research finds that these tsetse flies are infected with both Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma gambiense, which causes sleeping sickness. The exact reservoir for the virus remains unknown, but the study suggests examining buffalo, waterbuck, and other antelope living near Lake Victoria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
