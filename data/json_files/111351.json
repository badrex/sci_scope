He posits that the gland provides rigidity, tension, and flexibility to the vocal cords, allowing for a wide range of tones and pitches. Additionally, the thyroid gland acts as a loader, enhancing the sonorous quality of the voice. This function is essential for the perfection of human speech and expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Endocrinology & Physiology"}
