He uses a helix and various substances to measure any possible electrical currents caused by gravitational forces. Despite numerous tests, no conclusive evidence is found to support the connection between the two forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
