The study aimed to determine the relative magnetic forces at various locations using different instruments and needles. The results were compared with the horizontal force at Plymouth, and the final conclusions were drawn based on the collected data.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
