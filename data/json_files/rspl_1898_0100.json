The authors identify three types of electromagnetic waves and analyze their velocities and phases, providing insights into the limitations of Hertz's original theory and suggesting improvements for interference experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Waves"}
