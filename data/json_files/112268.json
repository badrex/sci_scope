They propose that the balance between acidity and alkalinity in the stomach and blood provides protection from self-digestion. Experiments show that when this balance is disrupted, the stomach can be digested by its own secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Gastroenterology & Digestive System"}
