They argue that Anoplotherium is a reduced and aberrant branch of the Paridigitata family tree, and that its limited number of specific forms and reduced skeletal structure make it an unlikely progenitor for the diverse Miocene and modern Paridigitata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
