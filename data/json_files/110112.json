The observations involved the use of signals, such as explosions of gunpowder, and were conducted by British and French teams. The final result found the difference in longitude between the two observatories to be 9\u00b0 21' 1 6, with a high degree of accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomical Observations & Measurements"}
