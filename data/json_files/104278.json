He discovers that the plant's volatile salt changes its nature as it approaches the sun, becoming less pungent in the warmer climate of Greenland. Nicolson also notes that the plant's properties change when brought to London, suggesting that climate plays a significant role in the plant's characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
