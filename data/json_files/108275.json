They find that induced contractions cannot be attributed to derived currents and suggest that they are the result of an electric discharge during muscle contraction. The author also explores the effects of various solutions on muscle conductivity and the differences between muscular and proper currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurophysiology & Muscle Physiology"}
