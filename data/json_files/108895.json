The study reveals that Sigillaria gradually transforms into ribbed and furrowed Sigillaria as it ages, and that it possesses two woody cylinders and a central axis composed of hexagonal vessels. Evidence is also presented to support the idea that Stigmaria is the root of Sigillaria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolution"}
