The experiment involves dissolving a mixture of helium and argon in water and observing the changes in the residue. The results suggest that helium is present in the atmosphere in very small quantities, possibly less than a ten-thousandth part.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Gas Chemistry"}
