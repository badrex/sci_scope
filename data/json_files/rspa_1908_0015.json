They determine the temperature at which the conversion occurs and analyze the gas emissions during the process. The experiments reveal that the diamond disintegrates and increases in volume, resembling coke, with a temperature of 1890\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical and Optical Physics"}
