The results show that the attractions and repulsions are between the substances, not the currents. This conclusion has implications for our understanding of molecular changes in bodies due to electric currents and magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
