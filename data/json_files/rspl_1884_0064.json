The author assumes that stress is transmitted in six direction lines at right angles to the crystallographic axes and derives the force function using general differential equilibrium equations. The nature of the boundary is determined, which can be either plane or spherical, and the force functions can be independently deduced without the assumption from any primitive form of the systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solid State Physics & Materials Science"}
