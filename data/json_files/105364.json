The woman, a cook-maid, initially had very dark skin, but gradually, her skin became lighter, eventually turning mostly white. The change was observed to be most prominent in areas not exposed to the sun, suggesting that sun exposure was not the cause. The author, Mr. James Bate, discusses various possible explanations, but does not reach a definitive conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Dermatology & Skin Conditions"}
