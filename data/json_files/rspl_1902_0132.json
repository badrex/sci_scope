They found that adverse conditions acting on the eggs gave rise to differences in the larvae, but these differences were not due to a change in the dominance of characters. The authors also showed that seasonal changes observed by Vernon were likely due to differences in temperature and not a change in dominance accompanying maturity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Evolution"}
