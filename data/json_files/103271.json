Hauksbee conducts an experiment to investigate sound propagation in a vacuum. He encloses a bell in a receiver and exhausts the air between the receivers. When the bell is struck, the sound is still vigorous, indicating that sound can propagate through a vacuum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
