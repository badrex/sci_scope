They find that the refractive indices change with temperature, and they introduce the term'sensitiveness' to describe the amount of change in refractive index per degree of temperature. They also observe that the length of the spectrum decreases as the temperature rises.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
