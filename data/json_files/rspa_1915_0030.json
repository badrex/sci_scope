They find that both radium B and radium C emit three types of radiation, which are exponentially absorbed. The results are in agreement with previous studies on the spectrum of the penetrating y-rays from radium B and radium C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nuclear & Particle Physics"}
