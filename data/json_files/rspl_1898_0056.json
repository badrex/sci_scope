They observe that the active area's dimensions and intensity vary with the degree of exhaustion and distance between the cathode and anti-cathode. The study also reveals that a significant portion of R\u00f6ntgen rays comes from the glass of the tube that shows green fluorescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
