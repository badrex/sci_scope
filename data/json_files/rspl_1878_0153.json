The presence of chlorophyll and starch in the animal's tissues suggests a more vegetable-like mode of life, challenging the traditional view of these organisms as purely carnivorous.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Development"}
