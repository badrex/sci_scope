The theory attributes the origin of electric and magnetic phenomena to the mutual actions between the medium and the electrified or magnetic bodies, rather than direct action between the bodies themselves. The paper also introduces the concept of 'electrotonic state' and provides a mathematical framework for understanding electromagnetic quantities and their relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Maxwell's Equations"}
