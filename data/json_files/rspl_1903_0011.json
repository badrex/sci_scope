The study shows that when dogs are fed milk, their pancreas secretes lactase, a ferment that inverts milk sugar, while dogs not fed milk do not produce this enzyme. The research suggests that the pancreas adapts to different foodstuffs by modifying its secretion, and that this adaptation is not solely due to a nervous mechanism but is influenced by a chemical stimulus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
