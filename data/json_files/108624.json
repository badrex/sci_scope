They find that the reaction does not occur instantaneously, but gradually increases over time. The study sheds light on the factors influencing the induction and the role of mass in the reaction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
