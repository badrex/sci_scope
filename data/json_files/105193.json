The instrument uses a micrometer screw to determine the changes in length and can accurately measure minute alterations in the metal bars. The author also discusses the importance of using a consistent basis for measuring expansions and the need for a controlled environment to ensure accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Measurement & Instrumentation"}
