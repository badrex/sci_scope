The humerus exhibits similarities to monotremes, edentates, and certain carnivores, but the author does not classify it as a monotreme. The new order, Gennetotheria, is associated with Stereorachis, and the author discusses the differences and similarities between this new order and other reptiles and mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Evolution"}
