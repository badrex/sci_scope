The study reveals that the two persistent carpals in the bird's wing, the intermedio-radiale and centralo-ulnare, are compound structures containing remnants of an intermedium and a centrale. The research also provides insights into the development of the metacarpal bones and the distal phalanges in the fowl.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
