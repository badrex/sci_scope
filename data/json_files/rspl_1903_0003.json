They prepare and characterize various derivatives, including methylstanniodoform, methylstannoxylic acid, methylstannibromoform, and methylstannichloroform. The reactions and properties of these compounds are discussed, providing insights into the chemistry of organotin compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic & Coordination Chemistry"}
