The method involves observing the relative position of fifteen small images formed by the binary combinations of the reflexions of the six surfaces of the glasses, and adjusting the glasses using four screws to ensure they are well-centered.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
