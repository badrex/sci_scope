The study reveals that the axis of a rifled projectile tends to align with the tangent of its trajectory due to the gyroscopic effect, and the air resistance acts as a force that counteracts gravity, affecting the projectile's range and motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
