Todd conducts experiments on the Torpedo electricus, investigating the voluntary power over its electrical organs and the effects of various incisions on the production of shocks. He observes that the shocks continue even after significant alterations to the electrical organs, suggesting a complex nervous system at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Neurophysiology"}
