The study reveals that the solubility of these compounds is influenced by the presence of excess silver nitrate and the concentration of the solution. The findings have implications for the experimental determination of the electrochemical equivalent of silver.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
