He found that after dividing these nerves, the fibers underwent disorganization and eventually disappeared. However, when the cut ends of the nerve were allowed to reunite, the nervous fibers were restored to their natural condition. Waller concluded that the disorganization and absorption of the nerve fibers were due to an interruption of their nutrition caused by the disruption of the nervous current.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
