These bees are distinct from other types of bees, such as wood-borers and leaf-cutters, as they create cases for their young rather than laying them directly in holes in the wood. The author discusses the nesting behavior of these bees and provides a specimen for further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Behavior"}
