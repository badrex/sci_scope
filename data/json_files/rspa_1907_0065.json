The authors find that alcohol and hydrogen chloride have different effects on the solubility of chlorides, with alcohol being a weaker dehydrant and hydrogen chloride a stronger one. The results suggest that the degree of dissociation of a dissolved salt is influenced by the presence of compounds containing its ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
