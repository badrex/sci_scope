The method provides the appropriate developments for the radius-vector, longitude, and latitude, and accounts for periodic and secular inequalities. The paper also discusses the advantages of this approach and the factors involved in its analytical circumstances.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Dynamical Astronomy"}
