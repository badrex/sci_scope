They find that the acid radical determines the value of surface-energy and that molecular volumes do not admit of regular comparison at temperatures with equal surface-energy. The study also reveals that boiling points at corresponding pressures do not bear a constant ratio to temperatures of equal molecular surface-energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
