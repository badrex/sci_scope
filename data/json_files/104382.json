The invention involves a cone-shaped vessel with a disperser that showers water onto the sides of a heated vessel, causing the water to be rarefied into steam. This steam can then be used to power machinery and engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Machinery"}
