The results show a steady growth of pressure, with a maintained increment of approximately 0.37 cubic millimeters of gas per gram of radium per day. The author also explores the possibility of helium occlusion in the cooled charcoal and surrounding glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry"}
