The results indicate that the apparent conducting power of water comes out a little greater with the screen than without, suggesting that conduction down the walls of the bath is not a significant factor in heat transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
