The author finds that the experimental curve lies slightly outside the theoretical ellipse, with differences increasing as the wavelength decreases. The results suggest that the surface of wavefront curvature in Iceland Spar is an oval curve rather than an ellipse.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Crystallography"}
