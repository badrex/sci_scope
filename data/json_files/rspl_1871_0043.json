Crace-Calvert investigates the role of oxygen in the development of putrefactive vibrios and the transformation of monads into microzyma. He demonstrates that oxygen is essential for the growth of vibrio-life and that the products emitted by these microorganisms can be detrimental to their development and locomotion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
