They discover that nerves acquire a secondary electromotor power when traversed by an electric current, which can produce an electric current in the opposite direction in a conducting circuit. This phenomenon is independent of the vital properties of the nerves and can be observed in both living and dead animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
