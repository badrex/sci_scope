It proposes that the energy distribution among degrees of freedom is not uniform and can vary with temperature. The paper also suggests that the velocity of sound in a gas depends on the ratio of the distance between the center of mass and the geometric center of the molecules to their radius.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics"}
