He provides experimental evidence using a sensitive flame and a sounding reed, suggesting that the position of the zone of silence depends on the height of the signal, the observer, and the pitch of the whistle's note.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
