He examines their properties and interactions, particularly focusing on the effects of potassium on these compounds. Davy also explores the potential for new compounds and the role of muriatic acid in these reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
