The instrument allows for the observation of phosphorescence in low-pressure environments and reveals differences in the duration and color of the residual glow among various yttrium components.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
