The experiment demonstrates that the refractive power of dense air is proportional to its density and expansions, with implications for astronomical observations and the measurement of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
