Smeaton observed the solar eclipse of June 4, 1769, at the Austhorpe Observatory near Leeds. He used an equatoreal apparatus and a 31/2 feet treble object-glass telescope to measure the duration and the part of the Sun's diameter remaining uneclipsed. Smeaton also noted the Moon's protuberant parts, which he believed were caused by mountains on the lunar surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Eclipses & Observational Astronomy"}
