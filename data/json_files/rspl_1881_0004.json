They conclude that the processes of cell growth, zymogen formation, and enzyme conversion occur simultaneously and that differences in histological changes among animals are due to varying rates of these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
