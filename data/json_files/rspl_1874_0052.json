By analyzing the specific gravity, boiling points, and expansion rates of phosphorus trichloride, oxychloride, and thiochloride, the author concludes that phosphorus is trivalent and that the specific volumes of oxygen and sulfur in oxychloride and thiochloride are consistent with their values when not 'within the radicle.' The author also discusses Buff's hypothesis on the variation of specific volume with chemical value and finds no evidence to support it in the case of phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
