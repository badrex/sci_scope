The study includes the use of gauges to measure rainfall and the observation of weather patterns in the region. The author also discusses the relationship between altitude and rainfall, finding that the amount of rain increases with altitude up to around 2000 feet, after which it decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
