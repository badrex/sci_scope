The study highlights the importance of the diaphragm's passive tension in retaining supplemental air in the lungs, restoring equilibrium, and maintaining pericardial space. The author also refutes common misconceptions about abdominal and thoracic breathing in males and females.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
