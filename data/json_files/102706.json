The phenomenon was visible for about a quarter of an hour after sunset and was similar in shape to the Aurora Borealis, though with a different color. Derham suggests that the atmosphere's disposition, including haze and vapors, might have caused the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Phenomena & Observations"}
