The study reveals a complex relationship between magnetic disturbances and non-cyclic changes, with oscillations in declination and a prevalence of disturbed days, even during seemingly quiet periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
