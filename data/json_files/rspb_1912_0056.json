It demonstrates that the orientation of bacteria in an electric field is influenced by the conductivity of the surrounding liquid and suggests that the conductivity of bacteria and liquid should be considered to effectively control the bactericidal action of electrical currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
