They discover that cathode rays can be deflected electrostatically and that the size of a cathodic shadow depends on the electric state of the object. The author also identifies and describes para-cathodic rays, which are emitted from the anti-cathode and have similar properties to Rontgen rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
