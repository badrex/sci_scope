The results show that the magnetized iron bar becomes more electrochemically positive compared to the unmagnetized bar, suggesting that magnetization affects the electrochemical position of iron in a solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Corrosion"}
