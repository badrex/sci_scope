As water vapor ascends and cools, it condenses, releasing heat and warming the surrounding gases. This process creates ascending currents, cloud formation, and ultimately, rain and winds. The extent of these disturbances depends on the amount of vapor condensed and the local climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
