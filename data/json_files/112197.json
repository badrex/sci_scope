The method involves the use of rational approximation, partial fractions, and quadratures to facilitate computation. The author also provides auxiliary tables and formulae for using trigonometrical tables with greater precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Approximation Theory"}
