Results show that rebreathing leads to a decrease in the volume of air breathed to expel a given amount of carbon dioxide, indicating changes in the chemical phenomena of respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
