They develop a method to control the light source's intensity and composition, allowing them to study the reaction's velocity and the laws governing chemical equilibrium under the influence of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry"}
