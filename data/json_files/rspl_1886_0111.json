He finds that the dielectric constant values are consistent with the electromagnetic theory of light and that the property of double refraction in liquids under powerful electromotive forces is very small, showing a close approximation to proportionality.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
