The study reveals that the cooling process causes certain alloys to separate, with the more fusible constituents forming the outer layer and the less fusible ones moving to the center. This knowledge can be valuable for understanding the behavior of these alloys in industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
