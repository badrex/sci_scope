The results show that the distal part of the optic nerve remains unaltered, while the central part behind the section becomes disorganized. The disorganized fibers can be traced back to the left optic tract, supporting the idea of decussation in the optic chiasma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
