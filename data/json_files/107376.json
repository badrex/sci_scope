He compared his catalog with Dr. Bradley's from 1756 and observed that the error in the earlier catalog did not exceed a quarter of a second. He also provided a table of mean barometer and thermometer readings for easy correction in other refraction tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
