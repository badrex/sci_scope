They compare its behavior with that of cane sugar and find that raffinose is less easily hydrolyzed, with a rate nearly one-fifth less than cane sugar. The study provides insights into the action of enzymes and the chemical properties of raffinose and cane sugar.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
