The process involves careful preparation and handling of the films to ensure a high-quality reflection. These mirrors offer good definition and extreme lightness, making them useful in various applications where weight and clarity are important factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
