Smith suggests that in negatively electrified bodies, the redundant electric matter tends to escape, leading to a destroyed equilibrium of cohesion. As a result, two such bodies repel each other, confirming Franklin's theory of electrostatics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
