By incorporating ocean attraction corrections into Captain Clarke's calculations, the author improves the resulting ellipse and reduces errors in latitude. The author concludes that the discrepancies between the Indian Arc and the mean ellipse may be due to significant changes in the Earth's surface and level relative to the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
