The study uses picric acid as a hardening agent for better results and describes the process of nerve development, including the attachment of nerves to the neural canal and the differences between anterior and posterior roots of spinal nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
