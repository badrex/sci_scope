They found that antelope can be infected by laboratory-bred and infected Glossina palpalis, but they do not transmit the infection to other susceptible animals effectively. This suggests that antelope may not be a significant reservoir for the virus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
