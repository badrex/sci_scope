The memoir discusses the Numerical Generating Function (N.G.F.) and the Beal Generating Function (B.G.F.) of covariants, as well as the theory of syzygies and segregates, and their applications to the canonical form of the quintic equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
