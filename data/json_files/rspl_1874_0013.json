The experiments involve suspending blood samples in a magnetic field and observing their orientation and movement, providing insight into the role of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood's magnetic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
