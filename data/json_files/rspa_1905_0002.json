They record the temperature of the rocks and analyze the factors affecting the thermal conditions of the region, providing insights into the Earth's temperature gradient and the challenges faced during the tunneling process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
