He discovers that the lens has a complex structure with a central nucleus, an outer spherical shell, and an intermediate shell in a state of contraction. This structure is essential for correcting spherical aberration and has different optical properties in different directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Optics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optical Physics & Instrumentation"}
