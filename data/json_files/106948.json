He finds that the loss of the eighth pair of nerves leads to fatal consequences, regardless of whether the division is sudden or gradual. This study aims to determine the nature of the substance that unites the extremities of divided nerves and whether it possesses the characteristics of the original nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
