Additionally, a new mode of respiration in Myriapoda is observed, and a study on the ginger-beer plant and its organisms is conducted, contributing to the understanding of fermentation yeasts and bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
