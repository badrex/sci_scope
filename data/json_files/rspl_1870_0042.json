The study provides a mathematical formula for calculating the discharge per unit of time from a pipe of given radius, which can be used to determine the velocity of the central filament and the resistance of each film.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics"}
