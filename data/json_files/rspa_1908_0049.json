They find that the permeability of Stalloy is high for small values of magnetic induction but decreases rapidly as the induction increases. The hysteresis loss for both materials lies between the losses for pure iron and Swedish iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
