He discovers that the dentinal tubes extend into the enamel, forming a significant portion of its composition. This finding distinguishes marsupial teeth from those of other mammals and provides insight into their dental development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
