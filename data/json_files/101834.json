When the valve is opened, the pressure of the atmosphere pushes a lead ball out of the barrel with considerable force, similar to a wind gun using compression. This experiment shows the potential for using rarefaction to create powerful weapons.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics"}
