He also provides analytical expressions for the development of R to terms multiplied by the squares and products of eccentricities, as well as terms in r(d) multiplied by the first power of the eccentricities.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics"}
