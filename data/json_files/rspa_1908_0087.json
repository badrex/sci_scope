They find that the arc spectrum of scandium consists of two distinct sets of lines, with each set behaving differently in solar spectra. The study suggests that the majority of scandium absorption in the solar spectrum originates at a higher level than iron absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
