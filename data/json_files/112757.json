Porcupine: Species Analysis and Distribution", "topics": ["Marine Biology", "Dee", "Coral Reef Ecology", "Paleontology", "Marine Geology"], "tldr": "The author analyzes the species of stony corals (Madreporaria) dredged up in the H.M.S. Porcupine expedition, providing information on their localities, depths, and temperatures. The study reveals the deep-sea coral-fauna's composition, including species that have lasted since the early Cainozoic period, species common to the area and the Mediterranean Sea, and species found on the area dredged and as fossils elsewhere. The author also discusses the variability of coral species and their distribution in different regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Ecology"}
