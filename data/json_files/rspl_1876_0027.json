They find that cotton-wool is unsuitable for covering these solutions and that using paper or tinfoil reduces the risk of crystallization. The author also explores the effects of different surfaces and the role of adhesion in crystallization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Solutions"}
