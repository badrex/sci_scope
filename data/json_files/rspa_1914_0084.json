They find that while argon is produced in some experiments, they could not detect any neon or helium. The presence of argon is attributed to a possible leak in the apparatus, and the entire investigation is considered negative for the production of rare gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
