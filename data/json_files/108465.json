He discovers that bismuth, when subjected to a magnetic field, exhibits a strong diamagnetic response and takes up a final position determined by its crystalline structure. This phenomenon is observed to be independent of the shape of the bismuth sample, but rather dependent on its crystalline condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
