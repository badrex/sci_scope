The research compares two filtration methods, 'contact' and 'continuous,' and examines the organisms involved in nitrification, comparing them to those found in soil by Winogradsky.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental Microbiology & Biotechnology"}
