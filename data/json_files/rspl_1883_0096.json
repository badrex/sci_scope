According to this law, energy moves perpendicularly to the plane containing electric and magnetic forces, with the amount crossing unit area proportional to the product of the two intensities and the sine of their angle. The authors apply this law to various current-bearing circuits, providing a new understanding of energy flow in electromagnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism"}
