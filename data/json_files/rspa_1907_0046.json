The study faces significant challenges due to the salts' low solubility and high refractive indices, but eventually determines their specific gravity, molecular volume, and optical character.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography"}
