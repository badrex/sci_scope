He observes and documents these changes over time, providing valuable information for future astronomers to study and compare. The findings contribute to the understanding of variable stars and their potential use in determining differences in terrestrial longitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Observational Astronomy"}
