They find that the globulin causes inflammation, oedema, and local ecchymosis when applied to the conjunctiva or injected subcutaneously, and can be fatal when a certain dose is reached. The study also reveals that the rapidity and intensity of the action are proportional to the quantity used.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Toxicology & Pharmacology"}
