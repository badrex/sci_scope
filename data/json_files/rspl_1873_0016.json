He discovers that the effectiveness of these signals varies greatly depending on atmospheric conditions and that the acoustic transparency of the air can change rapidly. Tyndall also observes that audible echoes can be reflected from an optically transparent atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Acoustics"}
