They find that the greatest changes in muscle swelling occur near the neutral point, and that different buffer solutions affect the degree of swelling. The iso-electric point for muscle colloids is determined to be within the pH range of 5 to 7.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
