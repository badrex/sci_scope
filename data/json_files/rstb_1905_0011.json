The research focuses on determining the minimum lethal dose, protective power of Calmette's serum, and the impact on nerve endings. The findings indicate that krait venom has a higher lethal action on rabbits compared to rats and that Calmette's antivenomous serum is ineffective against krait venom.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Toxicology & Pharmacology"}
