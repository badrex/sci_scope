The formula suggests that the primary disturbance required for this energy distribution is a solution of the equation expressing the motion of an aperiodic dynamical system. The author also compares their formula with Planck's formula and finds that they agree to within 3% for total radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics & Statistical Mechanics"}
