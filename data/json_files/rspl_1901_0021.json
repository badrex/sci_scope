The seed-like organs of Lepidocarpon are considered to have close analogies with true seeds but differ too widely from the seeds of known Spermophyta to indicate any genetic connection between Lycopods and Gymnosperms or other Phanerogams.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobotany & Plant Evolution"}
