They find that the flies can remain infective for up to 75 days, with the first signs of infection appearing 18 days after the initial feed on an infected animal. This study provides crucial insights into the transmission and development of sleeping sickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
