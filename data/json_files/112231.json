They argue that smaller disturbances, with periods of a few minutes, are not caused by earth-currents, and propose that peaks and hollows in the magnetograph curves represent rapid changes in the intensity of the whole disturbing force acting on the magnet.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geomagnetism"}
