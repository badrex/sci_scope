J. Frodsham's paper demonstrates the benefits of attaching a brass tube, called an 'isochronal piece,' to the top of a pendulum. This device allows for more precise control over the pendulum's vibration and can make unequal arcs of vibration correspond to equal intervals of time.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Timekeeping"}
