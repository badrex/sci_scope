The experiments show that the negative leak from lime is much greater than that from calcium. The authors also discuss the possible connection between the large emissions of negative corpuscles and the glowing property of alkaline earths when heated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Discharge & Plasma Physics"}
