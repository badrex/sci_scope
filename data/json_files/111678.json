The study confirms the dichromic theory of color vision, where the red element of color is eliminated, and the green and blue elements remain the same. The results show that the extreme red ray of the spectrum represents the defective element in color-blind vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Perception"}
