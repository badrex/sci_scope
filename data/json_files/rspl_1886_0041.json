The study reveals luni-solar variations in magnetic declination and horizontal force, with the variations being related to each other in a definite manner. This is the first time such luni-solar variations have been described, and the author believes that expressing these variations in a compact form with a definite physical significance will help in discovering the underlying physical conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
