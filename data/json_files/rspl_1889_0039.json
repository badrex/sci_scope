The study finds that horse urine varies widely in composition, even when the horse's diet and conditions remain constant. The author discusses the physical characters, such as turbidity, smell, reaction, consistency, specific gravity, and quantity of horse urine, and their variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Nutrition"}
