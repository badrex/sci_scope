They find that disintegrated cells do not induce immunity and often cause hypersensitivity in the animals, suggesting that the immunizing power of tumors is abolished when cells are mechanically injured.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Pathology"}
