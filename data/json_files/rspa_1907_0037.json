The author examines the continuous spectra of various alkali-metal salts and observes a multitude of bands in the rays of lithium, sodium, and potassium, which occupy spaces within specific wave-lengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
