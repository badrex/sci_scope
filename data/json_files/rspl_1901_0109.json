The prothallium varies in external form, but all require specific conditions and the presence of a fungus for germination. The prothallium is monoecious, with archegonial necks and antheridia present. The development of the embryo is similar to that of L. cernuum, with the embryo growing obliquely downwards and outwards, forming a protocorm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
