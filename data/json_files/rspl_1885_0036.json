The study reveals that the electrical resistance of cobalt increases with longitudinal traction, while the resistance of nickel decreases. The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between stress, strain, and electrical properties of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science"}
