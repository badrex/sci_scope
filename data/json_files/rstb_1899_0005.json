Megatherium Type", "topics": ["Bacterial taxonomy", "Soil microbiology", "Bacterial growth", "Bacterial isolation", "Gelatinous sheath"], "tldr": "The author isolates a large, unique soil bacterium that grows well on saccharine gelatine and has a gelatinous sheath. The organism can be isolated from other bacteria using acid media and is identified as a type of De Bary's B. Megatherium. The bacterium's growth characteristics vary on different media, and the gelatinous sheath gradually disappears with repeated transfers or aging cultures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
