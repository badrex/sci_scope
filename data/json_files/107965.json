He demonstrates that voltaic action can occur without the contact of dissimilar metals and that free electricity developed by heat does not become voltaic. The study also highlights the differences between free and voltaic electricity, as well as the limitations of existing theories on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
