The research focuses on three main experiments that demonstrate how environmental factors can impact the offspring's physical characteristics, such as the ratio between the total length and the width of the carapace. The findings suggest that environmental changes affect the metabolic products in the protoplasm, which are then passed on to the next generation, influencing their development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Genetics"}
