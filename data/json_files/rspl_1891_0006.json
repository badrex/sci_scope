They propose improvements to the design and provide a detailed analysis of the effects of the guard tube on the instrument's sensitivity and the law connecting the deflection with the potential of the needle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Measurement"}
