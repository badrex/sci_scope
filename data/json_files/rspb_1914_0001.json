They refute previous criticisms and demonstrate that their results are consistent even when stray light is rigorously excluded, suggesting that color perception is influenced by after-images and contrast effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Perception"}
