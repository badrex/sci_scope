The filtered water would be conducted through a main pipe or tunnel to a well, where it would be drawn up by steam power and distributed to the houses. The plan includes detailed instructions for constructing the filtering chamber and apparatus using materials such as brickwork, granite blocks, and layers of flints, sand, and gravel.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil Engineering & Infrastructure"}
