He suggests that the iron in ships becomes magnetic, affecting the balance of chronometers and causing alterations in their rates. Fisher also shares some experiments on the action of magnets on chronometers and discusses the possible influence of the balance spring.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Navigation & Instrumentation"}
