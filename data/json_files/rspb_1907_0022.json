They compare the French method of Maurice Nicloux with their own method and find that the Nicloux method is simple and rapid, but not as precise as desired. They also discover that allowing blood to clot before analysis can lead to inaccurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pharmacology"}
