They find that the proportion of heat lost through radiation varies significantly with the mixture strength, with stronger mixtures losing a larger percentage of heat. The authors also provide equations to estimate the total radiation received by the walls and the proportion of heat lost through radiation in hydrogen and air mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
