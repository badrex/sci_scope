Through a series of experiments, he explores artificial respiration, circulation, and the effects of temperature on the body, concluding that the motion of animals is produced by the force evolved in the process of combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
