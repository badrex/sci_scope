Although the brass work of the instrument was later found to be magnetic, these observations indicated the agency of the sun in producing the daily variation, leading to further, more extensive research.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
