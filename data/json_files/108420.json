W. Beechey reports on his systematic investigation of tidal streams in the English Channel and North Sea, combining data from various sources to create a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. He anchors vessels at different stations, observes the direction of the tide, and uses current logs to measure the rate of the stream. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of tidal streams and their impact on coastal regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrography"}
