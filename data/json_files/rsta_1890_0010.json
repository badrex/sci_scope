By observing the flow of water through a glass tube before and after silvering the interior surface, the author finds no significant difference in the time of flow, suggesting that the alleged slipping effect is either negligible or does not exist.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Rheology"}
