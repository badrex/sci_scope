They find a strong similarity between the flame spectra and oscillatory spark spectra of iron, nickel, and cobalt, suggesting that temperature may be the primary factor influencing the observed similarities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
