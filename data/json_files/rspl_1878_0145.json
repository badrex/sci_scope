It discusses the distinct features of the mammalian pelvis, such as the ilium's oblique direction and the changes in the symphysial union of the ischia. The author also compares the pelvis of various mammal species, including Monotremes, Ornithorhynchus, Echidna, and other mammals, and contrasts them with reptiles and birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Evolution"}
