The author also investigates the relationship between the lifting powers of electro-magnets and the length of the magnetic circuit, finding that the attraction is not inversely proportional to the length.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Induction"}
