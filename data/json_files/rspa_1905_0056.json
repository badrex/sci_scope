The authors analyze historical data from 1883 to 1903, finding a close association between rainfall and pressure, and a lag in the river's response to rainfall. The findings contribute to understanding the impact of weather changes on river flow and flood risk.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Water Resources"}
