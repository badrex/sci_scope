They explain how the union, separation, and fusion of cords affect the arrangement of floral organs and provide insights into the phenomena of cohesion and adhesion in plants. The study also clarifies the structure of axile and free central placentations in flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
