The study reveals differences between the maxima of absorption and selective reflection, particularly in the infra-red region, where the maximum of selective reflection is often significantly displaced from the natural wavelength or the position of maximum absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
