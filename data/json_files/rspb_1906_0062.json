The authors conclude that the axis cylinder, the essential part of a nerve fiber, has an exclusively central origin, and that the activity of neurilemmal cells is related to the development of new nerve fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
