The method measures small differences in pressure accurately and can detect differences in gas densities down to 1/5000 parts. The author demonstrates the method's effectiveness by comparing the densities of producer gas and air, finding a density of 0.001102 grams per cubic centimeter for the producer gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis"}
