The study includes records of observations, calculations of hypothetical diurnal tides, and comparisons with actual observations, leading to the conclusion that a second empirical diurnal lunar tide may be necessary for accurate predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
