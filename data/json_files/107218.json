The gizzards of grazing birds have unique adaptations for grinding and breaking down tough plant material, similar to the teeth of ruminating animals. This study provides insight into the digestive systems of birds that primarily consume grass and other vegetation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
