They use the Wheatstone bridge method and observe no significant effect, suggesting that the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction may be masked by other compensating changes or that the specific resistance of the material changes direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Relativity"}
