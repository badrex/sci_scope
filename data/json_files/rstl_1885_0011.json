They discover that the coloration in Actinia mesembryanthemum closely resembles that of reduced haemoglobin, and they successfully extract pigments using glycerin. The author also explores the decomposition products of these pigments, finding similarities to those obtainable from haemoglobin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
