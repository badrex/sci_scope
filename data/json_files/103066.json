De Moivre, presents a new curve of the third order resembling the Foliate curve and provides a method for its description and quadrature. The curve has similarities to the Foliate curve, but differences in its equation and properties, such as the greatest breadth and the relationship between its ordinate and the Foliate curve's ordinate.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Algebra"}
