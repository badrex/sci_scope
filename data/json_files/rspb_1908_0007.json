The study reveals that the average periodicity of the tremor ranges from two to eight per second, and the muscle's ability to maintain a rhythmic contraction decreases with fatigue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Muscle Physiology"}
