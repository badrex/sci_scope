The research finds that the barium sulphate acts as a cement, binding the sand grains together and providing durability to the sandstone structures, such as the Hemlock Stone and Bramcote Hill.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geomorphology"}
