They find that the loss of energy from air friction can be characterized as the dragging of the air, and the results show a close agreement with previous methods. The mean value of the coefficient of viscosity of air obtained is 0.00017746 at a temperature of 12.650 \u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics"}
