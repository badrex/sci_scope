He discusses the inability to distinguish certain colors, such as red and green, and the uniformity of the phenomena associated with this defect of vision. The study also offers insights into the primary colors and the potential use of dichromic vision as a tool for analyzing colors in the normal system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Vision Science"}
