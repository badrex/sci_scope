The authors find that paraffin oil shows a slight deviation from Ohm's law, while other liquids tested, such as benzene and olive oil, follow the law closely. The conductivity of all tested liquids increases with temperature, similar to electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena"}
