He explains that the asbestos is essentially calcined iron, and by adding phlogistic, it can be restored to its original state. The discovery of other geological features, such as lava and pumice stones, suggests that land may have been formed by subterranean fire.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineralogy & Geology"}
