He observes that the veins of the uterine decidua convey blood from the deciduial cavity into the veins of the uterus, suggesting a constant flow of maternal blood from the chorion cells through the decidua reflexa into the deciduial cavity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Reproductive Biology"}
