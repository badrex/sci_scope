It discusses the application of this principle to determining the number of conics that meet specific conditions, such as contact with a given curve. The author also introduces the concept of the \"supplement\" to account for special solutions and provides a method for determining the expression of the supplement.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
