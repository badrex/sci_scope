The results show that the right hand is larger than the left hand, and all the first joints for the left hand are more variable than the corresponding joints for the right hand. This suggests that there may be greater adaptation and selection occurring in the right hand.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Biology & Anthropology"}
