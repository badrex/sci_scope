They find that movements are primarily represented in the postero-external column of the spinal cord and that there is a lateral arrangement of points for producing different movements. Additionally, they observe a functional distinction between anterior and posterior roots, with anterior roots causing extension and posterior roots causing flexion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
