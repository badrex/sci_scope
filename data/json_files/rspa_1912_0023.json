They discuss the challenges in measuring the wavelengths and oscillation frequencies, and present a formula to calculate these values. The study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the properties of alkali metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
