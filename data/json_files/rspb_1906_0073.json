The research demonstrates that ethyl chloride has a paralytic effect on heart muscle, but a larger quantity is required compared to chloroform for similar results. The study also highlights the importance of further research to ensure the safety of this anaesthetic agent.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anaesthesiology & Pain Medicine"}
