They discover that conduction can occur downward and cellulipetal along ascending axons, propagating impulses in opposition to the usual orthodrome direction. This finding sheds light on the complexity of neural communication and offers a valuable tool for neurological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
