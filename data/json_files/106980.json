This heart had a single arterial trunk that divided into the aorta and pulmonary artery, bypassing the typical double-chambered structure. The child lived for seven days before passing away, and the heart was studied post-mortem to understand its structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular System"}
