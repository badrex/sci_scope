The method involves transforming the equation and using continued products to find the roots. The author demonstrates the method on equations of the 4th, 5th, 16th, and 622nd degrees.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Numerical Analysis & Optimization"}
