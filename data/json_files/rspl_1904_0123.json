The research finds that all common metals and alloys become more tenacious at low temperatures, with the increase in tenacity solely due to the low temperature and persisting only during its continuance.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science & Engineering", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Corrosion"}
