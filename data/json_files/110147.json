H. Christie, investigates the mutual action of magnetic particles and the law of variation of magnetic forces during rotation. He discovers that the greatest development of magnetism in a disc occurs when the axes of the magnets are vertically under points bisecting the radii, and that magnetism decreases rapidly as they approach the edge. The author also establishes a law of variation of magnetic force, which varies inversely as the 4th power of the distance between the poles of the magnets and the corresponding poles in the ring.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
