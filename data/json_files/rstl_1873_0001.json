The study reveals that the wind and barometer variations follow distinct patterns, with the wind's east-west movement influenced by land and sea breezes and the double diurnal oscillation of the barometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
