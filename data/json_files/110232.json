Frederic Daniell, invents a new register-pyrometer that can measure the expansions of solids and determine higher degrees of temperature on the common thermometric scale. He compares his results with previous experimentalists and finds a close agreement, establishing the reliability of his instrument.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
