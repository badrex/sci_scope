The study reveals a regular progression of morphological and optical constants with the atomic weight of the alkali metal, demonstrating the isomorphism between the ammonium and rubidium salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography"}
