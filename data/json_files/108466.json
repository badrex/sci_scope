He observes that some materials exhibit magnecrystallic phenomena, while others show only diamagnetic properties. Faraday also notes that the magnecrystallic axis plays a significant role in determining the orientation of these materials in a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
