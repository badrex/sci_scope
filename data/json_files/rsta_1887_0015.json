Thore", "topics": ["Rotational Phenomenon", "Ivory Cylinder Rotation", "Observation and Experimentation", "Magnetic and Gravitational Forces", "Thermal and Light Effects"], "tldr": "The author examines the 'new force' phenomenon discovered by M. J. Thore, where a delicately suspended ivory cylinder rotates when brought close to another object. The author conducts various experiments to determine the factors affecting the rotation and rules out the influence of heat, light, magnetic, and gravitational forces. The results suggest that the force might originate from the observer, but further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
