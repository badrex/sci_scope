The study reveals that the circulation in Vermes is reversed, with aerated blood going to the heart and then being propelled to the body's organs. This distinction highlights the essential purpose of the different circulatory systems in various animal classes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
