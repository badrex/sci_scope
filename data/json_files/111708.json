W. Hofmann investigates the decomposition of monammonium salts under heat and discovers that they undergo an analogous decomposition, allowing for both ascent and descent in the scale by substituting hydrogen for radicals. He also explores the potential for transforming triethylphosphine into diethylphosphine but remains unsuccessful.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
