He finds that the washed tree increased by 2 inches and 5/10ths, which is one-tenth of an inch above double the increase of the unwashed tree. The experiment suggests that washing and rubbing tree stems can significantly improve their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Forestry & Arboriculture"}
