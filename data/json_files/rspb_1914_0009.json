The results show that the optimum temperature remains constant regardless of substrate and enzyme concentrations, indicating that these factors do not influence the enzyme's activity at its optimal temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
