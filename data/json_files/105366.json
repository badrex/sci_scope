The process is observed in the mountain de Poligne, which the author believes was once a volcano. The author also suggests that a deluge may have contributed to the accumulation of wood in the mountain.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Mineralogy"}
