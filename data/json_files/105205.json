The fire-ball moved quickly across the sky, had a distinct shape with a nucleus and tail, and was not accompanied by any noise or explosion. Hirst compares his observation to another reported in the Gentleman's Magazine, suggesting that the fire-ball's height in the atmosphere must be considerable.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
