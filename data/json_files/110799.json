The study reveals that there are two distinct tidal periods per day, and that high tides do not always occur at noon. The findings challenge previous assertions by explorers like Kotzebue and Beechey.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
