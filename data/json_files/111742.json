The results suggest that the reducing power is not due to the presence of grape-sugar or other related substances, and further research is needed to determine the exact nature of the reducing agent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurochemistry & Neurobiology"}
