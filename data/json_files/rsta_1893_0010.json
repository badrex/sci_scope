They used a thermo-electric couple and a unique method to measure the distribution of temperature along the bars. The results showed that the thermal conductivity of iron decreases with increasing temperature, while that of copper increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
