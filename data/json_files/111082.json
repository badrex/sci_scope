He presents findings from Toronto and Hobarton, showing that the magnetic needle approaches the vertical position more in the winter months at both locations, and the total force is greatest from October to February and least from April to August.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
