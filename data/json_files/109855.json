He discovers that the diamond must be placed at a specific angle to the glass surface and that the cutting action is due to a continuous crack being made in the glass, which can then be extended with minimal force.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Hard Materials"}
