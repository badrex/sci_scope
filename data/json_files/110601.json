The study finds that a regular form and good approximation for the semimenstrual inequality can be obtained from one year of observations, and the lunar parallax corrections can be determined from a series of three to four years. The lunar declination corrections are more irregular but become apparent in a series of four to five years.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Geophysics"}
