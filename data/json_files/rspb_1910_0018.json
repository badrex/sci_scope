The results show that the liver appears hypertrophied in all cases, while the relative weight of the alimentary canal diminishes with the size of the tumor. The findings provide important insights into cancer metabolism and the influence of diet on tumor growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cancer Research & Oncology"}
