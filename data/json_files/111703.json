Instead, the organ constantly circulates electricity in its environment, and its activity can be renewed through nerve stimulation. This research contributes to a better understanding of animal electromotive apparatuses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Neurophysiology"}
