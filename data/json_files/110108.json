He divides the nerves supplying the deer's velvet and observes a decrease in temperature. The results support the idea that nerves can affect heat production independently of blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
