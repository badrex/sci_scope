The observations were made to establish a connection between the observations in India and other parts of the world. The final results show an excess of 0.64 of a vibration at Kew over Greenwich, which is considered a fairly probable value.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
