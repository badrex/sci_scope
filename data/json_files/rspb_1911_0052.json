They find that both substances are formed in a green leaf and that the bleaching of chlorophyll in sunlight is due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. The presence of carbon dioxide is necessary for the detection of formaldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Photosynthesis"}
