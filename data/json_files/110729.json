He observed elliptical particles and filaments, which he believed were not muscular fibers. The fish's blood and mucus also contained various globules, contributing to its unique properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
