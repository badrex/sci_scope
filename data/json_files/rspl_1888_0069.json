They use a sensitive Lippmann's capillary electrometer to detect the changes and find that the mammalian nerve shows a marked demarcation current and a small quick movement of the mercury following the application of a single stimulus. The results provide insights into the relationship between the cortex and the spinal cord in the production of epileptic convulsions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
