The author finds that the teeth of rodents have distinct structural features that set them apart from other mammalian teeth. These features are mainly present in the enamel and are consistent across different rodent species. The study also reveals that the teeth of some rodent species have specific structural characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from other known teeth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
