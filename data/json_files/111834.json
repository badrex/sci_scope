B. Airy, investigates compass deviations in both wood-built and iron-built ships, proposing a theory that combines polar-magnet-deviation and quadrantal deviation to explain observed deviations. He provides tables and methods for correcting compass deviations based on this theory, emphasizing the importance of using corrected compasses for accurate navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
