The author presents experiments that challenge the previously held belief that the descending limb of the respiratory wave coincides with chest expansion in inspiration and the ascending limb with chest collapse in expiration. The results suggest a more complex relationship between respiration and circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Respiratory Medicine"}
