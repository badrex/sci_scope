The author discusses the sequences in the second and third groups of the periodic table and provides evidence that these sequences depend on atomic volumes. Probable values of densities for europium and radium are also calculated based on their series formulae.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Atomic Theory"}
