The study reveals differences in the composition and amount of gases released from the two samples, with the Virginia iron producing a larger quantity of gas and a different composition of constituent gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
