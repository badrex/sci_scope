Norman Lockyer, describes his spectroscopic observations of the Sun, focusing on the chromosphere and its prominences. He discovers that these prominences are local aggregations of a gaseous medium that envelopes the Sun and suggests the term \"chromosphere\" for this envelope. Lockyer also notes variations in the thickness of the chromosphere and the intensity of spectral lines, and discusses the possibility of determining the temperature and pressure at the chromosphere's surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
