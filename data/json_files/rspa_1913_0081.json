They discuss the effects of such a shift on colour perception and present the results of a series of measurements, showing that these shifts can sometimes occur. They also explain how to detect these shifts using a simple spectrum test.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Sensory Systems"}
