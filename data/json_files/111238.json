The author identifies the need for a more accurate determination of the acceleration and presents a new term in the expression for the Moon's coordinates, which affects the secular acceleration.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Lunar Theory"}
