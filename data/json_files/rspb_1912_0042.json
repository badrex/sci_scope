The results show that immune rats resist tumor growth, while normal rats allow for successful graft establishment. The study concludes that the immune response plays a crucial role in preventing cancer growth in the host.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Pathology"}
