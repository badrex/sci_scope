The study focuses on the phosphorus series, where triethylphosphine exhibits distinct characteristics and provides a clearer understanding of the relations between monatomic and diatomic bases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
