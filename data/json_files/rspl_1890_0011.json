The study reveals that the atrial chamber originates from the fusion of longitudinal folds on opposite sides of the body, rather than from the growth of epipleural folds as previously believed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
