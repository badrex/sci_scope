The results showed that the horizontal directive force in Paris was greater than in London, with a ratio of 1068:1000. Additionally, the intensity of the directive force on the dipping needle was found to be greater in London than in Paris by about 15 parts in 1000.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
