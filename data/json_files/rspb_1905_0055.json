The research focuses on the Rothamsted experimental plots, which have been receiving consistent manure treatments for over 50 years. The findings reveal that the application of manures and the process of nitrification contribute to the loss of calcium carbonate in cultivated soils.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Soil Science & Management"}
