The author finds that tartrate of ammonia has no significant impact on urine acidity, while tartrate of potash makes the urine alkaline. Carbonate of ammonia also does not diminish urine acidity, and may even increase it. The author suggests further research to determine the cause of these differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nephrology & Urology"}
