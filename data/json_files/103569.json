They find that injecting dogs with the plague bile results in symptoms similar to the human plague, including buboes, carbuncles, and gangrenous inflammation. The study provides insight into the transmission and pathology of the plague.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Epidemiology & Infectious Diseases"}
