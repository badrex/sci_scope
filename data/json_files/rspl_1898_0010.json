The study reveals that the enamel layer in Elasmobranch fish teeth is a joint product of the enamel organ and dentine papilla, differing from mammalian enamel formation. This research sheds light on the evolution of enamel as a separate tissue and its development in different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Comparative Anatomy"}
