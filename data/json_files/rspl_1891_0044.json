They provide new insights into the pre-sphenoid region, basi-cranial fontanelles, and the presence of a ligamentous pro-coracoid in A. australis. The study also highlights the avian characteristics of the brain in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Comparative Anatomy"}
