Bradley, provides a detailed account of his observations of a comet that appeared in September and October 1757. He used the Royal Observatory to track the comet's movement and position, comparing it to nearby stars. The observations were made using a micrometer and a seven-foot telescope, and the data collected allowed Bradley to determine the comet's trajectory and its position in relation to the sun and the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics"}
