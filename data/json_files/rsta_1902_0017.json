They find that the velocity of the reaction is directly proportional to the amount of light energy introduced, and that the law governing chemical kinetics in this case is similar to Faraday's law of electrolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
