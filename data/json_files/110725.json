Robert Grove, investigates the formation of electro-nitrogurets through electrolysis and their properties. He discovers that using oxidable metals at the anode can create permanent compounds with nitrogen and hydrogen. The experiments also provide insights into the non-permanence of mercurio-ammoniacal amalgam and the decomposition of ammonia over heated metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
