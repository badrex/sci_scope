The study reveals that the spirometric range varies between individuals and is influenced by factors such as age, weight, and frame size. The findings suggest that one effect of frequent climate change is to increase the vicarious capabilities of excreting organs within certain bounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
