He discovers that drills can acquire a vigorous polarity during the hardening process and that heating an iron object through motion, such as drilling, can also bestow magnetism. The author also discusses the limitations of his experiments and the need for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
