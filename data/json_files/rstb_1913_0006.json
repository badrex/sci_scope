They observe symptoms of mountain sickness, analyze the oxygen pressure of arterial blood, and study the process of adaptation to high altitudes. Their findings contribute to understanding the human body's response to reduced atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Adaptation"}
