Sylvester, introduces and proves theorems on the degree and weight of the resultant of a multipartite system of equations. These theorems apply to homogeneous equations with various sets of variables and provide insights into the coefficients and degrees of the resultant equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
