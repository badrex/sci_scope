The study supports the tidal hypothesis, suggesting that the electrical conductivity of atmospheric layers responsible for the lunar magnetic variations is similar to that of the solar diurnal variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
