Results show that increasing fat in the diet leads to a decrease in urine quantity and an increase in faeces quantity. Nitrogen metabolism is also affected, with the total absorption of protein decreasing and the absorption of fat increasing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Metabolism"}
