The study explores the impact of this phenomenon on the ellipticity of the Earth and the importance of understanding the density variations within the Earth's interior for accurate geodetic measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
