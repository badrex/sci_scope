This observation provides evidence of Jupiter's rotation around its axis, similar to the way Earth rotates around its axis. The author also discusses the possibility of other planets having secondary planets and their potential rotation around their axes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Dynamics"}
