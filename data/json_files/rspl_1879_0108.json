William Siemens investigates the effects of electric light on plant growth and photosynthesis, finding that electric light can promote vegetation and enhance plant growth when combined with sunlight. The experiments demonstrate that electric light can be used in conjunction with solar light in greenhouses, but the loss of effect in such cases must be considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
