This effect is more pronounced at lower pressures and when the inner coating of the glass tube is positively charged. The phenomenon is not observed when the inner coating is negatively charged or when the magnetic pole-pieces are both north or both south.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
