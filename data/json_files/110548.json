The author, William Henry Barlow, investigates the principles of illuminating power and intensity of artificial light, and compares the use of reflectors and lenses in lighthouses. He concludes that lenses are more economical and efficient due to their reduced divergence of rays and smaller illuminated space in the horizon. Barlow also classifies lighthouses into three categories based on their functions and provides rules for their optimal design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optical Engineering & Design"}
