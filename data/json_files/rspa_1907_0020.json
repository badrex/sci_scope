They find that the equation can represent the experimental data, but only over a limited range of values, and discuss the implications for the freezing and saturation points of the solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Equilibrium"}
