They discover that the plant's mode of development depends on the size of its tuber, and that the root is of exogenous origin. The study reveals similarities between Phylloglossum and young plants of Lycopodium cernuum, suggesting that Phylloglossum may be a permanently embryonic form of a lycopodiaceous plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
