The energy required for cyclical changes in magnetization differs between these states, with iron requiring more energy when a larger force is applied to create previous history. The study also reveals differences in the shapes of hysteresis loops and the relationship between the required force and previous history force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
