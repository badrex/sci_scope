The research focuses on the changes in mineral composition and structure as a result of the intrusion of granite. The altered rocks exhibit various mineralogical and structural changes, including the formation of new minerals and the transformation of existing ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geochronology"}
