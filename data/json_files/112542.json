He observes distinct lines in some spectra, while others show only continuous streaks or no visible lines. He also studies the spectrum of lightning and notes numerous bright lines, including the blue nitrogen line and a suspicion of the red hydrogen line.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Spectroscopy"}
