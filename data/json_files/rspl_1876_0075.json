Through the addition of valuable materials and supplementary information, the author demonstrates that the round-headed division of tortoises is limited to Aldabra and not found in the Mascarene Islands. The study also provides a synopsis of the differences between the tortoises from these two regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Evolutionary Biology"}
