Magnesia is found to be effective in preventing the formation of red sand, while mineral acids can cause a return of red gravel. Vegetable acids, such as citric and tartaric, are less likely to produce this side effect and are recommended for treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
