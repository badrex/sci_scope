The study reveals that most metals, except platinum, exhibit volatility, particularly manganese and iridium. The spectra analysis provides insights into the characteristics and extent of various elements and compounds when exposed to high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
