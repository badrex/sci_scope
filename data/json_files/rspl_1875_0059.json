He observes that the glass case rotates in the opposite direction when a magnet is brought near, and discusses the internal friction affecting the movement. This study contributes to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of radiometers and their response to external forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Experimental Physics & Optics"}
