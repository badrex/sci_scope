W. Hofmann investigates the reaction between bisulphide of carbon and triethylphosphine, resulting in a new crimson-colored compound. The substance is insoluble in water and ether but soluble in alcohol. It has potential applications in chemical analysis and detection of trace amounts of triethylphosphine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
