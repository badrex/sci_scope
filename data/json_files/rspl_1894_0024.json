They identify the wavelengths, intensities, and origins of the lines in the spectra and determine the relative quantities of different substances present in the meteorites, concluding that the chief chemical difference between the two meteorites lies in the presence of calcium, nickel, barium, and strontium.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteoritics & Planetary Science"}
