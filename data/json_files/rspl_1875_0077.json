They find that the internal friction of the steel point on the glass socket, the vanes against the residual air, or both, is considerable. The results show that the movement of the radiometer is influenced by the force of radiation from the candles and magnets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
