The results show immediate paralysis below the lesion, followed by gradual recovery. Sensation is always affected on the side of the lesion, with painful sensations felt less on the paralyzed side, and tactile sensations only felt on the non-paralyzed side. Microscopic examination reveals descending and ascending degenerations in the spinal cord.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
