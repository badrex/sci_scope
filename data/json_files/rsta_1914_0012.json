He examines the impact of these glasses on ultra-violet and infra-red radiation, concluding that heat rays, rather than ultra-violet rays, are the primary cause of glass workers' cataract. He suggests that a protective glass should be opaque to infra-red rays and have a neutral or grey tint.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
