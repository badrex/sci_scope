He discovers that heat radiated from luminous hot bodies is divided into two portions by a glass screen, one being stopped by the screen and the other passing through without raising its temperature. The author also finds that the non-transmissible portion of heat is absorbed more readily by blackened surfaces, while the transmissible portion is equally absorbed by black and white surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
