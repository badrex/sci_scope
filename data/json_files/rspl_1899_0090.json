The research examines various salts and acids, finding that the ionization decreases more rapidly at higher temperatures and that the drop in ionization at extreme dilution may be due to interactions with solvent impurities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
