The author finds that the upper wind's direction aligns closely with surface isobars, and wind velocities observed match those calculated from pressure gradients. The study also reveals that the effect of the Earth's surface, apart from friction, reduces the velocity in a given direction in a constant ratio depending on the location.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
