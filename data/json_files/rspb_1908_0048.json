The research confirms that the ovule is cauline and suggests that the female cone and male flower may have evolved from an amphisporangiate strobilus similar to Bennettites. The endosperm development in Welwitschia is compared to Gnetum and found to be different from Ephedra. The study also proposes that the Gnetum-Welwitschia alliance has its origin in the same stock as angiosperms but separated before the carpel became the pollen-receiver.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
