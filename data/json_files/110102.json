Pond examines the annual variations of 23 principal fixed stars using observations from Dr. Brinkley and the Astronomer Royal. The results show mixed southern and northern deviations, with some stars indicating greater deviations than previously thought. Pond acknowledges the difficulty in determining such small quantities through astronomical observations and hopes for a resolution in the near future.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
