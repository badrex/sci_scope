The technique involves standardizing bacterial cultures and using a diluting pipette to create accurate dilutions. The study aims to understand the comparative bactericidal effect of human blood under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Immunology"}
