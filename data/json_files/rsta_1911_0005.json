They analyze the fundamental equations and discuss the conditions required for the conductor, ultimately concluding that the tangential component of electric force should vanish at the surface of the conductor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
