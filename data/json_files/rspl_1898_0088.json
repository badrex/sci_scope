They observe that when the electrodes are oppositely magnetized, green patches on the inner glass surface vanish, and a hazy blue cloud forms between the points. A luminous ring appears within the bulb when the electrodes are magnetized, and this ring is sensitive to changes in the charge on the glass walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
