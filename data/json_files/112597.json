The study reveals a minimum in 1864 and a maximum in 1859, with the ratio of these values being 2.6 to 1. The author also discusses the need for improvements to the observatory, such as acquiring magnetographs, a suitable room, and additional computers to process the old observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
