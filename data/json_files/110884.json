He found that the barometer often rises as well as falls under the influence of strong winds, and that the winds can blow with greater force with a rising barometer. This study contributes to the understanding of how weather phenomena, such as wind and atmospheric pressure, are interconnected.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
