Experiments on rabbits and a dog demonstrate that the brain is not directly necessary for heart action, and that the cessation of circulation is due to the suspension of respiration. The study also shows that respiration tends to cool the body rather than support animal heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
