The research highlights the frequency of mammary tumors, lung adenomas, and lymphomatous tumors, and examines the role of physiological factors and pathological changes in tumor development. The findings suggest that factors other than physiological demands on the mammary gland contribute to cancer development in mice, and that inflammation and hypertrophic changes in the mammary gland may play a significant role. The study also explores the success of tumor transplantation and growth in both spontaneously affected animals and normal mice, demonstrating the potential for mouse models in cancer research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cancer Biology & Oncology"}
