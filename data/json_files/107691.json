The experiments reveal that light alone cannot decompose corrosive sublimate, and that it requires the aid of other affinities. The author also discovers new compounds and reactions between corrosive sublimate and other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
