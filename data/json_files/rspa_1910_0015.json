They use a systematic recrystallization process to purify the materials and a precise balance to weigh the substances. The results contribute to the understanding of atomic weights and the accuracy of modern atomic weight estimations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
