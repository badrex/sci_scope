They propose a new method of analyzing the interference patterns, suggesting that the primary radiation can be considered continuous or as a series of independent pulses, simplifying the understanding of crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
