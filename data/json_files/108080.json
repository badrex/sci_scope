He finds that the spark passes through the air and the metallic conductor in less than one-thousandth of a second, and that the duration of electric light at each point in its path can be determined by observing the reflected image in the mirror.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
