They find that the iron specimen exhibits exceptional performance, with low hysteresis and high permeability, but is still inferior to transformer plate. The study also explores the effects of induced currents in the iron and the role of molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
