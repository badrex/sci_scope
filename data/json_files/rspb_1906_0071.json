The authors find that the extent of hydrolysis depends on the amount of enzyme and the proportion of acid present, and that larger proportions of glycerol can slow down the process. They also suggest that the selective action of lipase is controlled by the carboxyl radical in the ethereal salts being hydrolyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
