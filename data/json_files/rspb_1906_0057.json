They find that variations in the race, age, and site of the mice, as well as the amount and character of the cancerous tissue, can affect the growth of cancer. The study provides insights into the nature of cancer and potential therapeutic approaches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cancer Biology & Oncology"}
