The research reveals that the strain closely resembles other wild Glossina morsitans strains and belongs to the same species as the trypanosome occurring in humans, wild game, and wild Glossina morsitans in the \"Proclaimed Area\" of Nyasaland. The study also highlights the differences in virulence and morphology between the naturally infected dog strain and the parent species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Pathogen Biology"}
