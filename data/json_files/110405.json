B. Williams, presents evidence that most combustible substances undergo a low-temperature combustion process, producing light and heat. This phenomenon is observed in various organic compounds, and the author believes it can explain cases of spontaneous combustion in porous materials and heaps of coal, charcoal, and other combustible substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
