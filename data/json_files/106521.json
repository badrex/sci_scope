By forming two series from fractions and continuing them both ways, the fractions formed by dividing each term of the first series by the corresponding term of the second series will converge to the roots of the equation. This method allows for approximating two roots at once using one and the same series.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
