Hauksbee conducts an experiment to demonstrate the pressure of air on hemispheres. He uses two brass hemispheres connected by a wet leather seal and a glass receiver. By injecting an atmosphere of air into the system and measuring the weight required to separate the hemispheres, Hauksbee shows that the pressure of the air plays a significant role in the separation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
