Despite various attempts using sealing wax, a deal stick, and a coal cinder, no light was produced. The experiment ended with the globe breaking into pieces, possibly due to its imperfect spherical shape. Hauksbee concludes that if there is a quality like light that can be excited from a brass body under the mentioned conditions, the attritions used were too weak to force it out.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena"}
