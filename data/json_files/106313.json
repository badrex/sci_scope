He uses a ballistic pendulum to measure the velocity of the balls and investigates the relationship between the initial velocity, weight of the shot, and quantity of powder. This research is crucial for understanding the effects of gunpowder and the flight of projectiles in military applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Ballistics"}
