The study focuses on the impact of this phenomenon on practical navigation and compass bearings, providing detailed observations and comparisons of magnetic declination at various locations along the British coastlines.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
