He finds that certain wind directions are more prevalent during specific lunar phases and that the average annual rainfall in the area is 25.17 inches. He also deduces the effects of atmospheric tides on temperature fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
