Ward's Paper", "topics": ["Magnetic Rotation", "Double Refraction", "Polarization of Light", "Villari Effect", "Optical Rotation"], "tldr": "The authors analyze Mr. A. W. Ward's paper on the magnetic rotation of light in doubly refracting bodies and identify mistakes in his mathematical deductions. They argue that Ward's single differential equation should be replaced with two simultaneous differential equations to accurately represent the effects of double refraction and rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Electromagnetism"}
