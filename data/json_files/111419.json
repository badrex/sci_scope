The author also explains the difference between stereoscopic and pseudoscopic effects and proposes a new method for constructing a stereoscope using a single image composed of two images with different perspectives.", "scientific_discipline": "Optics & Light", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Imaging & Visualization"}
