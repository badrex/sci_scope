He investigates the effects of varying intensity, gas type, and exhaustion levels on the molecular disturbance and its illumination. The study also explores the convergence of molecular rays and the nature of green phosphorescent light produced under high exhaustion levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
