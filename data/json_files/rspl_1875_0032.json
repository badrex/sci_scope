The study reveals that the poison-fangs in viperine snakes develop in two parallel series, while in colubrine snakes, they develop in a single series similar to other Ophidian teeth. The research also discusses the unique features of the individual tooth-germ and the process of tooth fixation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Evolutionary Biology"}
