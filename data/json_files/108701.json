The study focuses on the pressure theory and stratification, comparing the structure of glaciers to the cleavage of rocks. The author presents evidence from various glaciers, concluding that the veined structure is not always consistent with stratification, suggesting that pressure may be the primary cause of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Glacial Geology"}
