The accounts describe the events, their impacts, and the reactions of the people who felt the tremors. The author suggests that such events may occur more frequently than commonly believed, as they often go unnoticed or unreported due to lack of significant damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Studies"}
