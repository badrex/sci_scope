Wollaston investigates the unique ability of diamonds to cut glass and discovers that the natural curvature of the diamond's edge is crucial for this process. He also finds that other hard stones, such as sapphires and rubies, can cut glass temporarily when given a similar curved edge.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Crystallography"}
