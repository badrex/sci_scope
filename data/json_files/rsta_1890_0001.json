They find that the specific inductive capacity increases with temperature for solids and decreases for liquids, except for one substance. The results suggest that the specific inductive capacity has a maximum value near the melting point of a substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Dielectric Materials"}
