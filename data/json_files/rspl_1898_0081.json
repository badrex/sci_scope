They find that the conducting power of salt vapors increases with increasing concentration and temperature, and that the molecular conductivity of salts varies depending on the type of salt and its concentration.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
