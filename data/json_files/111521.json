These peroxides are prepared by reacting anhydrous acids or their corresponding chlorides with barium peroxide. The author describes the preparation process, properties, and analysis of these peroxides, and discusses potential future research directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
