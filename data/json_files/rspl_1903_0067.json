Instead, they conclude that the sensation is caused by light rays emitted by the tissues of the eyeball, such as the cornea and lens, when they are traversed by alpha and beta rays from the radium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Systems"}
