They find that the layer, in which little temperature change occurs, cannot have significant convection currents. The study also explores the effects of radiation equilibrium and the role of energy transfer in maintaining temperature gradients in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
