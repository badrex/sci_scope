The study provides a comprehensive analysis of magnetic dip, horizontal force, and declination, offering insights into the complex relationship between Earth's magnetism and celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geophysics"}
