The research demonstrates that stimulation of the gills or other parts of the fish can lead to cardiac inhibition, and the mechanism involves the branchial nerves transmitting the afferent impulse to the medulla, which then sends an inhibitory impulse to the heart via the vagus nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
