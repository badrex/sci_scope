The experiments reveal that the tenacity of gold is affected by elements in the order of their atomic volumes, suggesting a connection between the periodic law and the behavior of impurities in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
