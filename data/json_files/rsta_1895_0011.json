They measure the electrical work done in a conductor and keep the electromotive force constant, allowing them to avoid estimating the excess temperature of the wire and measure time more accurately. The results provide a useful test of the agreement in determining the mechanical equivalent of heat through the heating of water by an electric current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
