The research reveals that these elements alter the composition and solubility of carbide in austenite, affecting the dissociation and precipitation of free carbon. The findings provide insights into the behavior of free carbon in various iron-based materials and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
