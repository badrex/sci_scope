The author demonstrates the duality and symmetry in elliptic space and extends the theory to solid geometry, kinematics, and the dynamics of a rigid body. The motion of a body is expressed in terms of six symmetrical angular velocities, and the theory of screws is also considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
