He discusses the unique features of the bridge, such as the unequal angles and the use of jetting to break the force of the Rhone River. He also suggests that the design could be useful for building bridges in Yorkshire, where streams are often torrents with rocky bottoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil Engineering & Infrastructure"}
