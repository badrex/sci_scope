He compares the Anglo-Gallic, Russian, and Indian arcs and deduces the mean semiaxes of the Earth, concluding that local attraction has a significant impact on the accuracy of these measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
