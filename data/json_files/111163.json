He discovers that the perceived magnitude of an object varies with the convergence of the optic axes and the magnitude of the images on the retina, challenging the prevailing theory on visual perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Psychology"}
