He finds that these disturbances follow periodical laws, similar to those previously discovered in magnetic declination, with periods of 1 solar day, 1 solar year, and approximately 10 solar years, corresponding to the Schwabe cycle of solar spots.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geomagnetism"}
