It creates a moving, three-dimensional image of an object by using a revolving drum with eight stereoscopic pictures and an eye-cylinder with two apertures. The Stereotrope allows the viewer to see the object in motion and with an appearance of relief, as if it were in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optical Engineering"}
