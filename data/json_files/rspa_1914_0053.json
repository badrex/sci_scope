They propose that the building to which the lightning rod is attached modifies the electric field, drawing the discharge to its upper parts, thus protecting the region around its base. Vertical rods rising from the corners of the structure to a height of about half its breadth can lift up the field of concentrated electric force, taking the discharge instead of the upper part of the structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
