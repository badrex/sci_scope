They find that the bark is the primary source of these alkaloids, with the trunk bark being the richest. The leaves and other parts of the plant contain minimal amounts of alkaloids, making them unsuitable sources for extraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
