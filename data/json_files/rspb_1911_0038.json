They find that under normal conditions, oxygen absorption is by diffusion alone. However, during muscular work or when breathing low-oxygen air, the lung epithelium is excited to secrete oxygen actively, indicating a new aspect of the physiology of mountain climbing, balloon ascents, and ordinary muscular work.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
