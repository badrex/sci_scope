He deduces mean values and formulas from these results, testing the accuracy of the observations and determining the degree of confidence that can be placed in them. Glaisher also discusses the temperature of the dew-point, the influence of latitude on weather, and the importance of comparing observed and calculated values.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
