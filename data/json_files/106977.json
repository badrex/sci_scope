They discuss the limitations of existing theories and propose a new approach to understanding ship stability, taking into account the specific gravity and dimensions of the vessel.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture"}
