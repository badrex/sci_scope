He demonstrates various geometric properties and representations of the catenary curve, including the connection between the catenary and the parabolic or logarithmic plus, and the graphical representation of angles added together by the parabolic or logarithmic plus.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Trigonometry"}
