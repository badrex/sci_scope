They find that when leaves are injured, the restriction in infection powers of certain 'biologic forms' breaks down, allowing them to infect plants that are normally immune to their attacks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Pathology & Mycology"}
