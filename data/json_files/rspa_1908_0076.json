The device consists of two posts connected by a line, with a float carrying a pulley for the support of the plummet line. The device is portable, can be used where no boats are available, and is unaffected by ordinary breezes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
