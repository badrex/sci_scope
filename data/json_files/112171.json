They observe that these birds have a lower temperature than expected and find that their bones contain air instead of marrow. Further investigation reveals that blood vessels are present in these bones, which shrink and are absorbed during the bird's growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
