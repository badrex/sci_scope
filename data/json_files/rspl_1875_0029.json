The researchers discovered a previously undescribed tissue and found that the lymphatic vessels and thyroid vesicles share morphological and staining similarities, suggesting a possible role in the formation of a material that enters the bloodstream.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
