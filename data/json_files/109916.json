Despite fifty-four observations, no appearance of parallax is found, and the author considers it a challenging task to establish its existence on a star far from the zenith. However, he plans to continue the investigation and communicate the results to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
