They find that cooling the bismuth reduces its resistance, and when transversely magnetized, the resistance increases. The resistance curves cross at specific points, depending on the temperature and magnetic field strength, revealing unique behavior of bismuth under these conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Condensed Matter Physics"}
