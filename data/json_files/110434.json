He examines various locations, including Calmar, Stockholm, and Upsala, and concludes that the elevation of the land has occurred over time. The phenomenon has been observed in the presence of shells, plants, and artificial marks in rocks, which indicate a change in the relative level of the sea and land.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
