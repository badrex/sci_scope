The authors determine the freezing points of various compositions and analyze the alloys' microstructures. They find that the alloys exhibit complex phase behavior and discuss the implications of their findings for the understanding of gold-aluminium alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
