The study reveals that the laws of terrestrial magnetism are inconsistent with those of a permanent magnetic body and are in accordance with a body in a transient state of magnetic induction. The findings support the idea that electric currents induce magnetism in the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
