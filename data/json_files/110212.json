He highlights the influence of oxidizing action, acid types, and metal properties on galvanic effects, suggesting that the electric current's direction is determined by the nature of the acid used.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
