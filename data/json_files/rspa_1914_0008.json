The method involves measuring the momentum of the rod and the end-piece after impact, allowing for the determination of both the duration of the blow and the maximum pressure developed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Materials Science"}
