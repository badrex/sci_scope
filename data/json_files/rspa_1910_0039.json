They determine the velocity of alpha particles at different points in their path and find that the velocity is proportional to the cube root of the range remaining. The study also reveals that the ionization curve for a pencil of alpha particles is different from that obtained for a single alpha particle due to variations in velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nuclear Physics & Radioactivity"}
