This system uses self-contained vibrators and avoids the use of the earth as a terminal, allowing for better tuning and selective reception of messages without interference from other stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Telecommunications & Wireless Systems"}
