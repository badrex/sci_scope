He examines various lenses from different animals and observes the succession of structures and their refractive actions. Brewster also discusses the implications of his findings for the cause and cure of cataract.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
