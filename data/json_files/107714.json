He finds that cast iron is the most effective protector and that the deposition of alkaline substances on the copper surface can be prevented by controlling the electrical power of the copper.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Corrosion Science"}
