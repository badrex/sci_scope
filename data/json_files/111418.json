They find that heat is evolved during compression and absorbed when the compressing force is removed. The results show that the force of elasticity in metals is not affected by heat, and they provide a mathematical expression for the work gained from the cycle of operations involving changes in pressure and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
