They find that 100 parts of carbonic acid contain 28.6% of carbon and conclude that the diamond is pure carbon. The study also reveals that charcoal, when properly prepared, does not contain hydrogen and does not act as an oxide of carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
