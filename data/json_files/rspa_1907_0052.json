They find that the discharge moves like a flexible conductor carrying a current and rotates continuously in the magnetic field. The speed of rotation is dependent on the magnetic field strength and gas pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
