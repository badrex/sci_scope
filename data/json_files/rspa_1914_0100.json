They find that the nature of the break and the type of electrode material can influence the results, and that the minimum detectable quantity of neon is comparable to that in a few cubic millimeters of atmospheric air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
