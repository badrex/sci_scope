He demonstrates the possibility of finding three arcs with specific properties, which was previously deemed impossible in the ellipse and hyperbola without the addition of algebraic quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Calculus"}
