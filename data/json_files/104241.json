He observes that when two threads are suspended near an electrified glass tube, they repel each other. The author also notes that the repulsive force is not solely due to the vibration of the tube's parts, as silk and thread exhibit different behaviors in response to the electrical effluvia.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
