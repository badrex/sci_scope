H. Jacobi's study on the reabsorption of mixed gases in a voltameter reveals that the gases diminish in volume and eventually disappear when in contact with the fluid that produced them. Jacobi hypothesizes that this phenomenon may be due to the gases being recombined on the surface of platinum plates, which is then renewed with every fresh portion of the gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes"}
