The authors developed a new method to measure the density of steam and the rate of expansion of superheated steam. The results show that the density of saturated steam is always greater than that derived from gaseous laws, and the rate of expansion of superheated steam varies depending on the temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
