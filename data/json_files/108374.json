Despite these irregularities, the tidal curves for the tides on both sides of a particular low water point are undistinguishable, suggesting that the observed peculiarities are real and not due to accidental circumstances of weather.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
