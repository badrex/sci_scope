The experiments reveal that sugar is constantly being formed in the healthy animal body, and the liver plays a crucial role in this process. This challenges previous theories that suggested sugar formation only occurred post-mortem.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Metabolism"}
