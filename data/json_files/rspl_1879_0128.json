They find that the display reaches maximum brightness at a height of 37.67 miles and is visible for up to 585 miles. The color of the discharge varies with the tenuity of the air, with carmine, salmon, and pale milky white tints observed at different altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electricity & Magnetism"}
