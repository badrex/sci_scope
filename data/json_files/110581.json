Cauchy and Mr. Kelland. He compares observed refractive indices with the results of Mr. Kelland's theory in the cases of sulphuret of carbon and oil of Cassia, finding a close agreement between the results of observation and theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
