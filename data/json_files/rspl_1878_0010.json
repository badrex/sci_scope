They also describe the different layers of the cortex, including pyramidal and oval cells, and discuss the discrepancies between Meynert's and Baillarger's descriptions of cortical layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
