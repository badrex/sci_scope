Mairan that the Earth's oblate spheroid shape is inconsistent with pendulum observations. Desaguliers argues that the Earth's shape is determined by gravity and centrifugal force, and that Mairan's calculations are based on incorrect assumptions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
