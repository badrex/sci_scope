The study demonstrates a regular penetration by vascular tubes and a secreting structure in the enamel organ, providing insight into the functional significance of the tubular enamel in these fish species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Ichthyology"}
