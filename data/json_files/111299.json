They discover that the refracting stereoscope causes anomalies in the illusion of depth, and explain the cause of this phenomenon, which is a defect detrimental to the beauty and correctness of stereoscopic representations. The author also proposes a new stereoscope design to overcome this issue.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
