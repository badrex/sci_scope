Sherrington observes that the direction of reflex movements can be influenced by the initial posture of the limb, suggesting that the spinal condition and reaction are affected by the posture already present in the limb at the time of stimulus application.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
