They describe the changes in cell division and the resemblance in the formation of giant cells, suggesting that these similarities may shed light on the nature of malignant growths and their remote causes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Genetics"}
