The authors use instantaneous photography to study the water surface configuration and the formation of bubbles and jets. They also explore the effects of surface conditions, dust, and temperature on the splash, as well as the influence of a flame on the splash's character.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics"}
