He describes the internal structure of the Squalus acanthius and the role of the oviduct in shark reproduction. Additionally, the author explores the unique properties of a gelatinous substance surrounding the ova and its role in aeration, comparing it to star-shot jelly and the jelly found in frog oviducts. Lastly, the author discusses the methods by which different animals supply their fetuses with oxygen, including the role of water and plant life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
