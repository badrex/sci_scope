{"article_id": "112508", "revised_title": "Investigation of Air Resistance on Rifled Projectiles", "topics": ["Aerodynamics", "Projectile Motion", "Ballistics", "Resistances", "Velocity"], "tldr": "The author examines the resistance of the air to rifled projectiles and develops a formula to calculate the resistance based on the initial velocity, projectile diameter, and weight. The formula provides a more accurate prediction of resistance than previous equations, and the author discusses the implications of this new understanding on projectile motion and trajectory calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics"}
