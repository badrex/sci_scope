They identify distinct areas of the cortex and analyze the lamination and cell layers, concluding that the Mole and Shrew have more specialized motor cortex due to their greater motor accomplishments compared to the Hedgehog.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
