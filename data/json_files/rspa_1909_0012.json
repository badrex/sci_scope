The results show that the secondary cathode rays emitted by the substances have varying penetrating powers, and the methods used help to determine the coefficients of absorption and the fractions of radiation that penetrate different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Subatomic Physics"}
