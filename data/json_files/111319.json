The instrument consists of two thermometric tubes with different bore sizes, connected by a bulb. The instrument can be used to measure fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and estimate the heating effect of a source of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
