The results show that the heart contracts before the pulse is indicated at the wrist, and provide insights into the intervals and synchronization of heart and pulse movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology"}
