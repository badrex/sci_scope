The results show that the proportion of yellow and green seeds in the offspring remains consistent regardless of the parent plants' ancestry, suggesting that heredity is determined by factors other than ancestral distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Heredity"}
