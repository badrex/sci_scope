They study the differences in the magnitude and character of motions produced at various stations and the relation between normal and transverse vibrations. The experiments provide a relative estimate of the amount of motion at different observing stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Engineering"}
