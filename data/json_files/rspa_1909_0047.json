The results show that the capacity of the ebonite condenser changes relatively to the air condenser, with a slow increase after a temperature increase and a slow decrease after a temperature decrease.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
