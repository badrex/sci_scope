They found that blood volume can be accurately expressed by the formula B = W, where B is the blood volume in cubic centimeters, W is the animal's weight in grams, and k is a species-specific constant. This indicates that smaller animals with a greater body surface have a relatively larger blood volume, making it misleading to express blood volume as a percentage of body weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
