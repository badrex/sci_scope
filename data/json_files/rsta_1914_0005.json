The theory is applied to various problems, including the stability of thin plates, struts, and boiler flues. The author also discusses the limitations of existing theories and the potential for future research in this field.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
