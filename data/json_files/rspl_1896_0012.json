The study suggests that the placenta serves as a storage site for nutritive fat, which is essential for fetal nutrition. The author also briefly discusses similar fat deposits in the placentae of other mammals, highlighting the importance of this finding for understanding fetal physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproductive Biology & Embryology"}
