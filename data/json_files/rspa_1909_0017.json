The results show that the fatigue process remains the same for both types of light sources, with the photoelectric activity decaying as the sum of two exponential terms. The study also observes minor variations in the observations, which are attributed to fluctuations in the intensity of the emitted light from the sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
