They derive the equations for the envelope of these caustics and determine that the secondary caustic is a sextic curve, which is a unicursal curve with the maximum number of nodes and cusps. The author also discusses the geometric construction of the secondary caustic and its properties, such as nodes and cusps.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
