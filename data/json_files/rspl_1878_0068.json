The researchers found that the duration of ventricular systole, the interval between auricular and ventricular contractions, and the effects of injuries on the heart's electrical activity can be observed and measured.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
