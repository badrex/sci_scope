He finds that they are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate of soda, with slight variations in specific gravity between different types of eyes. Chenevix also suggests that the density of the crystalline lens may play a role in the development of cataracts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
