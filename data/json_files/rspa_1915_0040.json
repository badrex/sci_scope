They also determine the minimum arcing potential differences required to produce many-lined spectra for each element. The results suggest that the conditions for obtaining these two types of spectra are sharply differentiated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
