The high specific gravity of the sandstone is due to the barium sulphate acting as a binding or cementing material. The author explores the possible ways in which the barium sulphate might have been deposited, including the influence of local geological and chemical factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geochemistry"}
