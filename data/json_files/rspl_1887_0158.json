Results show that the latency period is longer when the occipital lobe or superior-temporal gyrus is stimulated compared to the frontal area, suggesting additional nerve centers are involved in the latter case.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
