They discover that the cohesion and capillarity of a liquid depend solely on temperature, and that pressure has no effect on these properties. The study also reveals that the less soluble a gas is in a liquid, the less effect its presence has at any pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
