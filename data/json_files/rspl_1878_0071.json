The study shows that the earth must be significantly stiffer than pitch to resist tidal forces, suggesting that the interior of the earth cannot approach the fluid condition. The author also develops a theory for the bodily tides of an elastico-viscous spheroid, which can be used to analyze the effects of geological changes on the earth's rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
