The study concludes that the method of argument adopted by Professor Tyndall is not universally applicable, and alternative properties of the internal medium can be considered to avoid contradictory conclusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
