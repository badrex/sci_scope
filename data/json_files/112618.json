The primary mineral components are identified as nickel-iron, protosulphuret of iron, chrome-iron, and chrysolith (peridot or olivine). The meteorite's soluble mineral is found to be chrysolith, with magnesia preponderating over iron. The author also compares the Dhurmsalla meteorite's composition to that of another meteorite that fell in Dundrum, co. Tipperary.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteoritics & Planetary Science"}
