The study reveals that the membrane's ability to resist the transition of aerial vibrations and the Eustachian tube's role in sound transmission play a significant role in hearing and deafness.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Otolaryngology & Audiology"}
