They find that the actual brightness of the corona was likely not very different between the two eclipses, and the slight apparent diminution observed in 1893 is probably due to air haze and sky illumination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
