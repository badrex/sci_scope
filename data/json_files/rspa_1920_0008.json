The instrument uses an electromagnet, a magnetic circuit with a silicon alloy core, and a phosphor-bronze strip for greater sensitivity. The authors describe the apparatus, its operation, and preliminary experiments, and discuss the advantages of the new method over previous techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
