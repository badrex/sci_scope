He finds that the air is fatal to animals when passed through quicksilver or water, but can be made less dangerous by shaking it for an extended period. The author also discovers that breathing inflammable air through the mouth, rather than the nose, does not protect animals from its lethal effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
