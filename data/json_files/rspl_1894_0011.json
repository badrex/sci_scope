The study reveals that each lateral half of the cerebellum can act independently, and that the cerebellum influences the excitability of the opposite cortex cerebri. The research also identifies symptoms resulting from experimental cerebellar lesions and discusses the role of the cerebellum in coordination, rigidity, and motor paresis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
