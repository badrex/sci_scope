The process involves creating pits, filling them with earth, and treading it to reduce it to a pap-like consistency. The water is then passed into another pit where it crystallizes into saltpetre. The saltpetre is further purified by boiling and exposed to clear nights to remove impurities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
