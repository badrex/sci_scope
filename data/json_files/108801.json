They find that thallium and iron exhibit different percentage decrements in conducting-power compared to other metals, and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the behavior of metals and their alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
