They discover new aldehyde isomers, such as metacrolein and elaldehyde, and study their properties and reactions. The findings contribute to the understanding of aldehyde chemistry and the formation of isomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms"}
