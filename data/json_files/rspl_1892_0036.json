They observe hydrogen lines, sodium lines, and other spectral features, concluding that the star's spectrum has no direct relationship with that of bright-line nebulae, comets, or carbon oxide spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Stellar Spectroscopy"}
