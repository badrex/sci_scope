This method is more sensitive than traditional spectroscopy techniques and can detect gold in various fineness levels. Further research is needed to fully examine and describe the properties of the films created through this method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Materials"}
