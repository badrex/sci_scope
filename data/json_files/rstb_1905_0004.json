The author discusses various theories about the nature and function of these structures and concludes that they are groups of alveolar cells altered by fatigue, which can be reconverted into alveoli during rest.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Endocrinology & Hormones"}
