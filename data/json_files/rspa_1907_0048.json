They also discover that canal rays make one side of the mica vane much hotter than the other, suggesting a radiometer action. The authors conclude that canal rays produce similar mechanical effects as cathode rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
