The study suggests that the pressure of radiation from the Sun causes negatively charged particles to be driven away, charging the atmospheres of celestial bodies and potentially causing discharges and cathode rays. The research also explores the connection between sunspots and magnetic storms, finding that the time between a sunspot passing the central meridian and the occurrence of a magnetic storm is approximately 42.5 hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
