He finds that the withdrawal of air from these bodies extinguishes their light, while the reintroduction of air restores it. This suggests a connection between light and air, and the importance of the environment in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
