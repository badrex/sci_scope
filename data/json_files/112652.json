W. Siemens demonstrates that permanent magnetism is not necessary to convert mechanical force into electrical force. He describes an experiment using an electromagnetic machine with a rotating keeper and a commutator, which produces powerful electrical effects without the need for permanent magnets. The mechanical resistance increases rapidly, leading to either the driving-strap slipping or the insulated wires heating up and potentially igniting their insulating silk covering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
