He suggests that the acidity of the soil, specifically the presence of carbonic and nitric acids, plays a significant role in dissolving and softening the bones, leading to the distortion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Soil Chemistry & Archaeology"}
