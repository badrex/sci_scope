He finds that the quantity of earthy phosphates is greater after consuming food, while the alkaline phosphates are present in higher amounts after exercise and when consuming bread alone. The author also examines the alkalescence of urine, identifying two types: ammoniacal and from fixed alkali.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
