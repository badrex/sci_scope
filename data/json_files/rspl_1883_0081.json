The study shows that an aqueous extract of the seed-capsules can coagulate milk and has potential for use in cheese-making. The optimal extraction method involves using a 5% sodium chloride solution, and the extract can be used as a substitute for animal rennet.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Biochemistry"}
