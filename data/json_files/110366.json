He also determines that the resistance to a flat surface does not exceed 1251b per square foot at a speed of one mile per hour, increasing at a rate higher than the square of the velocity for greater speeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Oceanography"}
