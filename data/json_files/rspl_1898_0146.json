The study reveals that stomata in terrestrial plants partially close during the night, while aquatic plants show little to no closure. The hygroscope also demonstrates the effect of various factors, such as light, temperature, and mechanical stress, on stomatal opening and closing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
