Rutherford investigates the succession of changes in radioactive bodies and the decay of their activity. He discovers that the decay follows an exponential law and that the products of these changes undergo further transformations. Rutherford also examines the nature of radium, its decay, and its potential disintegration products, including the possibility of radium being a product of uranium, thorium, or actinium present in pitchblende.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry"}
