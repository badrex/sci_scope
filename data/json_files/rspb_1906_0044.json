They also observe that these forms are present before the nuclear membrane has disappeared and the spindle fibers have acted on them, suggesting that the different forms are not due to the fortuitous manner in which the gemini may become attached to the spindle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Cytology"}
