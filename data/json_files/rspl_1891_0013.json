The study reveals that certain sensory impulses pass mainly up the same side, while painful impressions travel up both sides. The findings also show vaso-motor disturbances, degenerations, and the origin and course of long and short tract fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
