Joule investigates the thermal effects of elastic fluids, particularly air, when exposed to pressure and passing through a plug of non-conducting porous material. They describe their large-scale experimental setup and findings, including the cooling effect that occurs when air is forced through a narrow aperture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
