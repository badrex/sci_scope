They find that the extent of disintegration depends on the metal's nature and that the presence of oxygen can augment the effect. The study also provides evidence of the emission of metal particles at right angles to the heated metal surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
