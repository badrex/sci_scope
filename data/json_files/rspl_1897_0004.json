They find that excitation of the cerebellum causes a distinct relaxation of the triceps and contraction of the biceps when the 'acerebral' tonus is established, indicating a central effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
