Norman Lockyer, investigates the wave-length of the chief fluting in the spectrum of manganese and compares it to the aurora spectrum. He redetermines the wave-length with increased dispersion and discusses the discrepancies in previous observations. The study aims to determine if the spectrum of the aurora might be partially due to meteoric dust in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Elemental Analysis"}
