The research shows that gravity influences the organisms' orientation and movement patterns, leading to network-like aggregations. These aggregations are essential for maintaining the organisms' circulation and preventing overcrowding, which could harm their existence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
