The authors use a spark of an induction coil as the light source and analyze the absorption through spectroscopy. The results show the different absorption patterns and limits for each substance, providing insights into their chemical properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Chemical Analysis"}
