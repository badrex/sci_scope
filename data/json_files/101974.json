The findings suggest that gunpowder's force is not solely dependent on the length of the cannon and that further improvements in shooting can be made by optimizing the composition of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
