The results show that increased temperature within physiological limits does not directly quicken the heart rate in mammals, contrary to the findings in cold-blooded animals like frogs. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the complex physiological mechanisms and extrinsic nerve centers in mammals when interpreting the effects of temperature changes on heart rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
