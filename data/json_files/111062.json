The phenomenon was characterized by a belt of light extending across the sky from east to west, with a brown vapory cloud extending along the horizon. The light emitted from the zone was milky white and compact, with motion observed only in the zenith where it intersected the Milky Way. The author concludes that the dark cloud may have served as a conductor, feeding the zone and drawing off the matter of the aurora from the north.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences"}
