The method involves observing the coincidence of images formed by the two segments of the divided object-glass and measuring the distance between them. This technique allows for more accurate angle measurements, especially when used with reflecting telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
