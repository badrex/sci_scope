They use a hydraulic press to apply pressures up to 13,000 atmospheres and observe the marble's deformation and changes in appearance. The results provide insights into the processes of rock deformation and folding in the Earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
