It shows a progressive decrease in the number and intensity of disturbances over the years, with a minimum in 1863, during the first half of the decennial period. The study also examines the distribution of disturbances affecting the forces in different years, months, and hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
