By examining beans, Waller discovers that the presence of an unequivocal blaze current indicates a living seed, while the absence of this current suggests a dormant or non-living state. This research provides a foundation for further investigation into the relationship between electrical activity and plant vitality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
