By applying a process of interpretation based on physical grounds, the author aims to discover the results due to physiological differences and separate them from those caused by physical factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
