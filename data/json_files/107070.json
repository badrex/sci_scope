The study reveals that these humours are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate, with the basis of the aqueous humour being soda. The specific gravity and chemical properties of each humour are also examined and compared across different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
