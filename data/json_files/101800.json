Du Vernay, examines the structure of the nose and its role in odor perception. He observes that the labyrinthine structure of the lamellae and the presence of glands in the nasal tunic help trap and analyze odorant particles, contributing to the nose's sensitivity. The study also compares the nose structure and smelling capabilities of various animals, such as hounds, hares, foxes, wild boars, and humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
