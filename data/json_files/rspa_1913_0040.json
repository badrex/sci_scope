They discover three distinct peaks in the reflection intensity at specific angles, which are common to various crystals. The authors also discuss the absorption coefficients of the reflected rays and the potential for diffraction effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
