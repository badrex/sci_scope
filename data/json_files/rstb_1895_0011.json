The author presents a critical analysis of existing evidence and new experimental data, concluding that stomata play a significant role in gaseous exchange, with both cuticular and stomatic pathways contributing to the overall process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Ecology"}
