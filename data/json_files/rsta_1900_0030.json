They demonstrate the accuracy of this method by comparing experimental results with calculated values for an elliptical and circular cylinder. This method can be applied to practical problems in two dimensions, such as magnetic fields in dynamo or alternator armatures and cylindrical cases for magnetic shielding.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
