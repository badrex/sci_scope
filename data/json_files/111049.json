The paper also discusses improvements to the adjustment of lamps and the use of naphthalized gas and oil lamps for photographic registration. A new method for determining the scale and temperature coefficients of force magnetometers is presented, which may provide greater accuracy than previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences"}
