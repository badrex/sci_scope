The study reveals the process of egg development and the role of germinal vesicles, granules, and oil-globules in the formation of ephippial eggs. The author also discusses the anatomy of the ovary and the receptacle, as well as the differences in reproductive processes between Daphnia species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
