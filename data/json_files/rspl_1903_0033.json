They find that the anterior limit of the motor field is not abrupt and that faradization of the cortex can elicit various movements. They also observe the recovery of movement after ablation of the facial area of the motor region and discuss the similarities between anthropoid and human brains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
