He observes significant temperature differences between the earth's surface and the air above it, and demonstrates how atmospheric conditions, such as humidity and cloud cover, can impact the rate of heat loss from the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate Science"}
