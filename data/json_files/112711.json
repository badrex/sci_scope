The study reveals that commissural fibers are more extensive than previously described, and that many convolutions have no direct connection with the crus, central ganglia, or corpus callosum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
