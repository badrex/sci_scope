They also construct a new entropy-temperature diagram for saturated gas at low temperatures and provide data for specific volume, relative densities, and dilatation and elasticity of liquid carbon dioxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
