He incorporates new information from Major Strachey's work on the physical geography of the region and adjusts the assumptions about the height of the table-land. The resulting northern deflections and errors in astronomical amplitudes are discussed, highlighting the need for accurate deflection data to improve geodetic calculations and mapping precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
