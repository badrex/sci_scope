The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that acute affections of the nervous system are the only diseases with an excess of phosphatic salts in the urine. In functional diseases of the brain, such as delirium tremens, the secretion of phosphates is significantly diminished.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Medical Chemistry"}
