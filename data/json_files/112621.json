He discovers that rubber films can selectively absorb and separate gases, allowing for the creation of a dialyzed air with unique combustion properties. Additionally, certain metals like palladium and platinum exhibit a high capacity for absorbing hydrogen gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry"}
