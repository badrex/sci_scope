He discovered a brilliant elliptic ring within the nebula, which was well-defined and had no connection with the surrounding gaseous envelope. The ring's form is either elliptic or circular, seen in a line nearly perpendicular to its plane. Lassell's observations suggest that more gorgeous systems may exist beyond our view.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
