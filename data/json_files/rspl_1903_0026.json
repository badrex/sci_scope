They argue that the process involves a longitudinal fission of the spireme thread and the formation of U-shaped chromatin bands, which are later separated into the reduced number of chromosomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Genetics"}
