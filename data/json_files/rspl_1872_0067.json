The study reveals that a heat of 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) is often sufficient to kill bacteria, while a higher heat is necessary to prevent putrefaction in organic infusions. The author suggests that the delayed putrefaction may be due to the influence of the non-living organic matter in the inoculating compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Pathology"}
