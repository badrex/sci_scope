They develop a thermodynamic argument to determine the osmotic pressure corresponding to the concentration at the top of a column, allowing for a comparison between osmotic and vapour pressures at the same concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
