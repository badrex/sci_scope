The author provides a historical summary of previous research and findings, and discusses the significance of Antedon as a 'typical form' in understanding the broader Crinoidea group. The study aims to contribute to the understanding of the structure, physiology, and life-history of this species and its implications for the Crinoidea order as a whole.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
