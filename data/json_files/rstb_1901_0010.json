The yeast is found to be a high-temperature form, with optimal growth occurring at 25-30\u00b0C. The organism reproduces through vegetative propagation by budding and the formation of spores, with spore-containing cells consisting of two cells joined together by a neck.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Cell Biology"}
