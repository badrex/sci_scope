The authors find that a structural mechanism exists to protect capillaries from the maximum secretory pressure within the gland's alveoli and ducts. This mechanism involves a dense network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli and a strong, structureless membrane called the membrana propria, which limits the expansion of alveolar cells and supports the capillaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
