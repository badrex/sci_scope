The salt has the formula K3Ca(C2O4)4\u00b74H2O and can be prepared through various methods. The author also discusses the crystal's solubility, stability, and color variations under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography"}
