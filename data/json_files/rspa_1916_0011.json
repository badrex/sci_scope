They compare their findings to previous research on iron flame spectra and solar iron lines, discussing the implications of their results for understanding the behavior of iron in different environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
