He conducts experiments with various gas combinations and concludes that chlorine and oxygen, and hydrogen and carbonic oxide, are the most effective in producing a voltaic current. Grove also discusses the battery's potential use in eudiometry and explores theoretical views on the contact theory and the source of caloric evolved during voltaic action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Batteries"}
