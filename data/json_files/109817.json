He compares the cooling rates of equal volumes of venous and arterial blood, as well as their temperatures in different parts of the body. The results suggest that venous blood has a slightly higher capacity for heat than arterial blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
