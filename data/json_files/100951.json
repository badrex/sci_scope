Hugens investigates the cause of quicksilver remaining suspended above the usual height in Torricellian experiments. He suggests that a subtle matter, more potent than air, contributes to the pressure that keeps the quicksilver suspended. This hypothesis is supported by three experiments, including a siphon experiment that refutes the concept of fuga vacui.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
