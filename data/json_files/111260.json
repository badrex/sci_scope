Sabine about his calculations of magnetic inclination formulae for various locations in Europe. He discusses the annual variation of the magnetical inclination and the approaching dip to a minimum. Hansteen requests more recent observations from other scientists, including those from London, to improve the accuracy of his calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
