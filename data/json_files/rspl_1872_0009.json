The reaction results in the formation of various aromatic compounds, including dimethyltoluidine, methylxylidine, and trimethylophenylamine, demonstrating a method for rising from one carbonated series to another.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms"}
