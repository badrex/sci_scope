Akin, investigates the electromotive force of thermo-electric couples and the role of metal tensions in their function. He demonstrates that the electromotive force can be expressed as the difference between two quantities, dependent on the temperature and the nature of the circuit. Akin also explores the influence of the texture and chemical nature of substances on thermo-electric function and discusses the possibility of thermo-electric inversions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
