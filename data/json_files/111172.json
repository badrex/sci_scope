They demonstrate that the iris is influenced by the ophthalmic ganglion, sympathetic system, retina, and cerebral nervous arc. The study also reveals that contraction is the active state of the iris, while dilatation is its enervated condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
