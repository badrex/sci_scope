By placing two equal circles in the same plane and allowing them to dilate while maintaining the equality of their diameters, the author believes that the Theory of Parallels can be established without relying on the axiom of the straight line.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
