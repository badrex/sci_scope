He discovers that the magnetic power is proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through a given space, and that the finer the wires, the stronger their magnetism. He also demonstrates that the magnetic effect can be produced at a distance through air, water, and even through thick plates of glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism"}
