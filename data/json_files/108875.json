Miller, describe their efforts to analyze the spectra of fixed stars using a specially designed apparatus. They discuss the difficulties they faced due to the Earth's atmosphere and the feebleness of starlight. Their observations led to the identification of dark lines in the spectra of stars, similar to those found in the solar spectrum, which they attribute to the presence of specific elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Spectroscopy"}
