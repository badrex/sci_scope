Luteine is present in various parts of animals and plants, and its spectrum is distinguished by its brilliant red, yellow, and green parts and three absorption bands in the blue, indigo, and violet spectrum. The discovery of luteine's identity in mammals and eggs may lead to a revision of current theories on the homologies of various parts of animal ova and eggs of birds and lower animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic & Biochemistry"}
