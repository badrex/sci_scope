They calculate the thermal efficiency and the work output per unit of heat applied to the system, providing valuable insights into the potential advantages of air-engines over steam-engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Energy"}
