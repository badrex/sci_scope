The researchers found that weak stimuli tend to produce reflex contraction, while stronger stimuli cause reflex inhibition. They also discovered that galvanic currents are more effective in inducing reflex contraction compared to faradic stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
