He suggests that this phenomenon may explain discrepancies in solstice observations and the apparent projection of red stars onto the moon's surface. Lee also provides recommendations for improving the accuracy of atmospheric refraction measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Atmospheric Science"}
