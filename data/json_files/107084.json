The patient consents to surgery, and the nerve is divided, resulting in immediate retraction of the cut ends. However, post-operative complications arise, including swelling, pain, and a return of spasms. The patient eventually recovers, but the hard state of the cicatrix, including the end of the divided nerve, is identified as a probable cause for the return of spasmodic attacks.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurology & Neurosurgery"}
