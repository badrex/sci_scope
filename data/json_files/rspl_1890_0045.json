They conduct experiments using carcinomata and other tumours, attempting to cultivate micro-organisms and transplant cancerous tissues into animals. Despite negative results in cultivating micro-organisms, the authors do not dismiss the possibility of cancer being micro-parasitic in origin and suggest further research into suitable culture media.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oncology & Pathology"}
