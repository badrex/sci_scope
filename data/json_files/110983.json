Norton, proposes a new approach to understanding terrestrial magnetism by connecting it to the thermal elements of the Earth. He establishes that the horizontal intensity of magnetism is nearly proportional to the mean temperature, while the vertical intensity is related to the temperature difference between two points. This connection suggests that the laws of magnetism and heat distribution are closely related, and the mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism is accurate in its essential features.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
