They develop a table to resolve odd numbers up to 191 into not exceeding four square numbers, and demonstrate how this can be extended to divide any odd number from 4n^2 + 2n + 1 to 4n^2 + 2n + 191 into square numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Number Theory & Algebra"}
