The child's bones were dislocated, and some were ossifying, making reduction difficult. The cause remains uncertain, but the mother's fall before delivery is suspected. The child's condition is monitored, and if it dies, the author intends to donate the body to the Royal Society for further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pediatrics & Neonatology"}
