He discovers that the red ray has the highest heating power, while the violet has the least. He also finds that the maximum illumination lies in the yellow or pale green range. Furthermore, Herschel suggests that radiant heat may be of different refrangibility and proposes using dark-green and smoked glasses for viewing the sun through telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
