Cayley investigates the invariants and covariants of binary quintics, focusing on the covariants of degree 6 and their syzygies. It also explores the theory of equation character determination and the Tschirnhausen transformation, with a particular emphasis on the bicorn curve and its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
