He examines the concept of the magnetic axis and the duality of magnetic force centers, analyzing the equations of dipping needles in various locations. While the results do not definitively confirm or deny the duality hypothesis, they provide valuable insights into the nature of magnetic phenomena and the need for more accurate and extensive observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
