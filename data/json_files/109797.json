He discovers that the number of plates required for complete polarization varies with the angle of incidence and the refractive density of the materials. This research provides a connection between the properties of doubly-refracting crystals and the polarization of light by oblique reflection, offering a potential explanation for the leading phenomena of double refraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
