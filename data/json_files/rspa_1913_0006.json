They find that hydrogen crystallizes in the regular system, forming needle-shaped crystals, while oxygen's solidification is a complex process involving a viscous liquid phase and slow crystal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solid State Physics & Cryogenics"}
