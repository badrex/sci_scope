The study concludes that the coagulable lymph in dog blood coagulates between 114\u00b0F and 120.5\u00b0F, while the serum requires a higher heat of 160\u00b0F to coagulate. The author also finds that inflammation may actually reduce the blood's coagulation tendency, contrary to previous beliefs.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hematology & Blood Disorders"}
