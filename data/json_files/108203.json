He demonstrates that when viewing a painting and a real object with both eyes, the visual appearance and perception differ due to the dissimilar perspective projections on the retinae. This finding challenges the possibility of creating perfect representations of three-dimensional objects in art.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Psychology"}
