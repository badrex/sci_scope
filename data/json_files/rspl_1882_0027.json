The study reveals that the oldest rocks in Socotra are gneisses, with granites and felsites present in various regions. Limestone is also prevalent, with some specimens showing partial dolomitization. The island's geology suggests a complex history of volcanic activity and erosion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
