They demonstrate that the electric inertia of 'electrons' at speeds comparable to that of radiation depends on the energy of a steady state and propose a new method to determine the motion of charged conductors and insulators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
