Hannay's Microrheometer", "topics": ["Viscosity", "Water", "Microrheometer", "Capillary flow", "Fluid dynamics"], "tldr": "The author analyzes the viscosity of water using Mr. J. B. Hannay's microrheometer and finds that the calculated values for the viscosity of water are discordant and absurd compared to other observers' results. The author suggests that it is premature to discuss Hannay's observations on saline solutions or criticize his generalizations until the discrepancies are resolved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
