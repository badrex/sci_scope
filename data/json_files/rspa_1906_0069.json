The results show that at temperatures between -183\u00b0C and -160\u00b0C, the velocities of both positive and negative ions are nearly directly proportional to the absolute temperature, but at -160\u00b0C, the velocities are equal and smaller than expected from the linear relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Fields"}
