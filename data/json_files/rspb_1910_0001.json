They find that metals like aluminum and zinc exhibit bactericidal effects, while copper does not produce peroxide of hydrogen. The study suggests that the bactericidal action of these metals is related to the presence of dissolved oxygen and the production of hydrogen peroxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental Chemistry & Materials Science"}
