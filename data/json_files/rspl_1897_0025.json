Sherrington explores the mammalian spinal cord as an organ of reflex action. It discusses the connection between spinal nerve-centres, the various laws of Pfluger, the distinction between spinal reflexes and cortical reactions, and the solidarity of the isolated spinal cord as a'reflex' organ. The lecture also touches upon the influence of afferent spinal roots on willed movements, cortical reactions, tonus, and rigor mortis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
