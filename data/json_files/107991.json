The gases were found to be a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, with a higher concentration of nitrogen. The author speculates on the possible sources of this gas mixture and its implications for the understanding of volcanic activity and hot springs.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Volcanology & Geochemistry"}
