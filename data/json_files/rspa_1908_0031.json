The study explores the relationship between periodic time, total current, and the magnetic induction, as well as the energy dissipated by electric current overcoming resistance and magnetic hysteresis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
