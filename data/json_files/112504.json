The paper demonstrates that every odd number can be expressed as the sum of four squares, and every even number can be expressed as the sum of two, three, or four squares. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between polygonal numbers and the properties of odd and even numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Number Theory & Algebra"}
