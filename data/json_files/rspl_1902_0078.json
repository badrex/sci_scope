The authors find that gold-silver alloys are isomorphous and that their freezing point depression follows a straight line. They also observe that the alloys have a fine-grained structure and recommend using silver as the alloying metal for trial plates in the coinage process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
