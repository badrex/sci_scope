He discusses its unique anatomy, including the absence of digestive organs, and presents a new theory on the mechanism of circulation and respiration in rotifers. The animalcule's transparency and observable development make it valuable for embryological studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Biology"}
