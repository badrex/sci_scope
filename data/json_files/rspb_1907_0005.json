They observe the process of encystment and suggest that the cysts may be passed out of the fly and play a role in the parasite's life cycle. The author also discusses the difficulty of tsetse flies infecting themselves through cysts, as they have a different feeding and reproductive behavior compared to other insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Protozoology"}
