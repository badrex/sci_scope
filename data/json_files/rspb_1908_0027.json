The researchers observe that the number of chromosomes in some eggs exceeds the expected somatic number, and discuss possible reasons for this phenomenon. They also describe a process of parthenogenetic segmentation in some eggs, which eventually leads to degeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Development"}
