He finds that Vesta appears as a point of intense light, similar to a fixed star, and estimates its diameter to be half that of Saturn's fourth satellite. Vesta's small size and intense light suggest that it is near Earth and may share a cosmological origin with other planets in the same region.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Asteroids"}
