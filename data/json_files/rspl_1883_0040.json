Experiments show that the sound-post contributes to the support of the belly and influences the nodal arrangement of the plates. The author also explores the impact of different materials and structures on the sound quality and vibration transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound Engineering"}
