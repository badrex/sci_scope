The experiments reveal that mercury freezes at 40 degrees below the zero mark. The author also shares Dr. Joseph Black's letter, which provides additional insights and suggestions for conducting similar experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
