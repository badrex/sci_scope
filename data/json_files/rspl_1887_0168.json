They also find that pearls have a different composition than mother-of-pearl, with pearls containing more organic matter and less water. The authors question the origin of a cocoa-nut pearl they examined, as its chemical composition and structure closely resemble those of shellfish pearls.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
