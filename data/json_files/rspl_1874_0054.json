He discovers that the action of cold substances is actually repulsion by radiation and that the attraction and repulsion are influenced by factors such as the density of the substance, its surface, and the surrounding gas. The author also demonstrates that the sensitivity of the apparatus to heat rays is greater than that of an ordinary thermo-multiplier.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
