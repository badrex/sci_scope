The authors found that the average maximum pressure of bile secretion in cats was 304.4 mm, and in dogs, it was 300 mm. The research also discusses the methods employed to measure bile pressure and the potential factors affecting the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Gastroenterology & Hepatology"}
