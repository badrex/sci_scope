The study concludes that these phenomena are not solely due to physical attractions or light influences, but rather involve complex interactions between vital irritability, chemical agents, and environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
