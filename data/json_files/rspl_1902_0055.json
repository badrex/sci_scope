G. Lyons and Professor R\u00fccker conducted magnetic observations in Egypt from 1893 to 1901, using a Declinatorium and Kew Magnetometer. They recorded declination, dip, and horizontal force at various locations, including Cairo, the Lybian Desert, and the Nile Valley. The study aimed to understand the magnetic field variations and the impact of geological features on the observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
