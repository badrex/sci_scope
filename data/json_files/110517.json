He concludes that sugar is not the only vegetable matter decomposed during fermentation and that olefiant gas plays a significant role in the process. The author also discusses the formation of carbonic acid and other substances during fermentation and challenges the concept of alcohol and ether as separate, distinct principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
