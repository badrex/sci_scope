The hypothesis is applied to various planetary systems, including the Aristarchian, Ptolemaic, and Tychonic systems, and is used to generate a vortex motion that aligns with the elliptical hypothesis of planetary motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
