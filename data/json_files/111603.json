Gassiot investigates the electrical discharge in vacuo using an extended series of the voltaic battery and discovers that the stratified discharge can be obtained without an induction coil. He also observes a change in the character of the stratifications when heating potassa, indicating a chemical reaction taking place in the battery.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Fields"}
