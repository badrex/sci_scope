They demonstrate that these cells play a crucial role in the transference of food materials from the intestinal epithelium to the lacteals, and that they disintegrate and dissolve in the chyle, releasing proteins and other nutrients.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
