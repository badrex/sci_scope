He describes the improvements in apparatus and technology that have facilitated these investigations, such as the D'Arsonval galvanometer and the thermostat. The author also highlights the importance of the vaso-motor center in temperature regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
