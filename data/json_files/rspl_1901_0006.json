The research finds that these outgrowths are formed in a moist atmosphere with adequate light and heat, and are likely due to the local accumulation of osmotically active substances produced under abnormal conditions of reduced transpiration and excess carbohydrate development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Botany"}
