They used a modified light source and improved their experimental methods to achieve greater accuracy in their measurements. The results were compared to previous findings, showing that their new values did not differ by more than 2% from the previously published values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
