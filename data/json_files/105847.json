The first event showed a gradual shift from a typical aurora borealis to a rare aurora australis, while the second event displayed a red, fiery appearance in the sky. These observations provide valuable insights into the atmospheric conditions and celestial phenomena of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
