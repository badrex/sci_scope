The cone's structure and affinities suggest it is closely related to the Sphenophyllaceous plants, a group of plants with undetermined affinities. The discovery of Cheirostrobus in such an ancient deposit highlights the possibility of finding synthetic types of plants with combined characteristics of distinct orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Systematics & Evolution"}
