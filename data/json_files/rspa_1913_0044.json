They observe a reduction of stress after yield, with stress remaining at a constant value over a strain several times the elastic strain. The results suggest that the stress reduction lies between 25% and 33%.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
