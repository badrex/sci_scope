The study involves determining the electric and magnetic forces at the surface of the obstacle and the distribution of sources inside it, leading to the conclusion that the principal part of the effect of the obstacle is obtained by assuming specific electric and magnetic current distributions on the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Wave Propagation"}
