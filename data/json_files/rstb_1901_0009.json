They find that choline, derived from the breakdown of lecithin, is present in higher quantities in the fluid and blood of patients with degenerative diseases of the nervous system. The authors also explore the relationship between choline and the Marchi reaction, a method used to detect nerve fiber degeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
