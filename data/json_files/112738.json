He finds a close agreement between the irregularities of the two phenomena, with galvanic irregularities usually preceding magnetic ones. The study also reveals a constant turn towards the north and a larger force towards the west in the galvanic currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Geophysics"}
