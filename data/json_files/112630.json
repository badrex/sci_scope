The fatty acid is found to be white, crystalline, and has a melting point of 54\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and ether. The author speculates that it may be a mixture of stearic and palmitic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Metabolites"}
