The patient's condition was not improved by traditional medical treatments, so a paracenthesis was performed, drawing a significant amount of fluid from the patient. Upon the patient's death, the liver was dissected, revealing its glandular nature and confirming the observations made during the patient's life.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Pathology"}
