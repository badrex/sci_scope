They also observe that the temperatures of these contractions correspond with the proteids' coagulation points as determined by von Firsch. The study includes experiments with both frog and mammalian muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
