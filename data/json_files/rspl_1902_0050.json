The study investigates the elastic equilibrium of a long bar and provides solutions for different cases, including the effects of external stresses, total tension, total shear, and total bending moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
