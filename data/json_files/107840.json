The proposed design utilizes sulfur carbide as the fluid medium, offering advantages such as high dispersive power, colorlessness, and transparency. The author demonstrates the feasibility of this approach and discusses the potential benefits of this novel construction method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Astronomical Instruments"}
