They develop a comprehensive theorem for the transformation of these operators and discuss their applications in various cases, including the transformation of annihilators of invariants and reciprocants.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Analysis"}
