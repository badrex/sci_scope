They demonstrate that the force is not due to residual magnetism but rather the lines of magnetic force of the earth, and discuss the effects of magnetic circuits on the retention of magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
