The freezing point is determined to be near 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and the optimal strength for congelation is found to be very determinate, with a small variation above or below this point rendering the acid incapable of freezing without a considerable increase in cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Properties"}
