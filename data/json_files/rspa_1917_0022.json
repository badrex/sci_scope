The method involves constructing time-velocity and time-distance curves, and applying step-by-step calculations to determine the trajectory's elements, such as vertical and horizontal velocities, time-intervals, and direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering"}
