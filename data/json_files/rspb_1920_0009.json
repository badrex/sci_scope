They find that these rogues arise sporadically from self-fertilized seeds and have a unique set of genetic properties. The authors also investigate the distribution of these traits in the offspring of crossbred plants and observe the progressive assumption of rogue characters in intermediate plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Genetics & Breeding"}
