The research explores the properties of these currents, their relationship to the normal electrical response, and the effects of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and prolonged darkness or illumination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
