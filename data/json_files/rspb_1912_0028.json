They find that acetylmethylcarbinol is produced in all cases, while glyceraldehyde is not detected, challenging the theory that sugars undergoing bacterial fermentation break down primarily to trioses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Biochemistry"}
