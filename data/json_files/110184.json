The process involves purifying the platinum, reducing it to powder, and casting it into a mold. The resulting malleable platinum can be forged into various forms, demonstrating its tenacity and ductility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
