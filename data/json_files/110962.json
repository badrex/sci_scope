He suspects that these discrepancies are caused by magnetic influences on the masses and balls used in the experiment. The author concludes that these influences are independent of gravitation and proposes methods to eliminate this source of error in future experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
