He demonstrates their evolution and the tissues they are composed of, establishing their classification as ductless glands. The study also refutes existing theories about the spleen's function and blood-disc formation and destruction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
