The researchers demonstrate that temperature plays a crucial role in the development of the phenomenon, with agglutination occurring more readily at lower temperatures. They also find that the serum of infected animals contains auto- and iso-agglutinins, which contribute to the agglutination process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Pathology"}
