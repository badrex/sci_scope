He discovers that the reflected light's color changes depending on the angle of incidence and the type of media used. This phenomenon can be explained using the undulatory theory of light, suggesting that the density or elasticity of the ether varies near the surface of different bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
