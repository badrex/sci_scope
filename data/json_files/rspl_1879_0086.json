Mills discovers a new phenomenon called 'chemical repulsion,' where chemical reactions can occur at a distance and exclude one another. He demonstrates this through experiments using baric chloride and hydric sulfate, showing that chemical action can take place at a distance and that multiple identical chemical actions can completely exclude one another.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Dynamics"}
