They explore the relationship between conductivity and electromotive force, concentration of salt, and the behavior of different salts in various flames. Their findings suggest that the coloration of flames and their electrical conductivity when containing vaporized salts may be due to a common cause, involving the presence of free ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
