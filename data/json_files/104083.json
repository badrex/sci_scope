He shares his experience and progress in developing this method, which involves a series of accurate observations of the Moon taken at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Halley's method aims to improve the accuracy of determining longitude at sea, which was a significant challenge for sailors during that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Navigation"}
