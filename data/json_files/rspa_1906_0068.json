The dredging operations have deepened the channel, allowing larger vessels to navigate the river more easily. The British Association for the Advancement of Science analyzed the tidal curves before and after the dredging to understand the changes in the tidal patterns and their effects on the river.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Oceanography"}
