They found that the previous formula for calculating sound velocity needed to be adjusted for atmospheric conditions and the effects of wind. The experiments were conducted with great attention to detail and accuracy, using advanced instruments and techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
