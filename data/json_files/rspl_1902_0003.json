The study reveals that the spectra of metals in water-spark discharge exhibit broadened and reversed lines, which are similar to the spectra of new stars. The phenomenon is attributed to pressure, which causes the duplication and broadening of lines in the spectra of new stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
