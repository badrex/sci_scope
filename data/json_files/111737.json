This research helps establish the third hypothesis, which states that vitreous electricity carries heat in an unequally heated copper conductor, and resinous electricity carries heat in an unequally heated iron conductor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Thermodynamics"}
