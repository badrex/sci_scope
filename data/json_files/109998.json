He compares it to a comet observed in 1593 and discusses the challenges in computing its elements due to its proximity to the sun. He requests Dr. Wollaston to present his method for calculating the comet's elements to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrodynamics & Orbital Mechanics"}
