He suggests that the presence of a large coronal atmosphere in stars may result in visible bright lines alongside dark lines in their spectra, making it difficult to distinguish between stars and nebulae.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Spectroscopy"}
