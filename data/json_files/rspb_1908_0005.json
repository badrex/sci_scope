The study focuses on various measurements and angles, such as calottal height, Schwalbe's angle, and the frontal and orbito-frontal angles, concluding that the Neandertal race has unique features, particularly in the bones of the face and basi-cranial axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anthropology & Human Evolution"}
