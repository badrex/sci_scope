The author examines the influence of temperature, illumination, and nutritive solutions on leaf development. The study concludes that the osmotic substance causing initial water accumulation in intumescences is likely an acid, possibly oxalic acid, and that root pressure is not involved in their formation. The paper also compares nuclear phenomena in intumescences, wound-callus, and pathological tissues in plants and animals, finding similarities in their rapid formation and amitotic nuclear division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
