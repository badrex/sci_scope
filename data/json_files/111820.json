He suggests that the sun has magnetic poles and that its magnetic axis may not coincide with its axis of rotation. This hypothesis could explain the observed changes in the Earth's magnetic declination and the connection with the sun's position during the year.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
