He finds that even minor vibrations can cause a significant loss of magnetic power, which becomes permanent after reaching a certain point. This suggests that magnets possess a specific retentive force that cannot be further diminished by additional agitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
