He examines the work of previous researchers, including Sir David Brewster, Mr. Airy, and Professor Lloyd, and conducts his own experiments on various surfaces and films. The study reveals regular changes in the form of reflected light rings, which support Mr. Airy's formula for the periodical colors of films.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
