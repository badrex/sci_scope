He found that the vessels of the bark are better suited to carry fluids towards the roots than in the opposite direction. This was demonstrated through experiments with vine shoots, cuttings of gooseberry and currant trees, and inverted grafts of the apple-tree. Knight's observations support the idea that plant vessels have valves, similar to the venous system in animals, which direct the flow of sap.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
