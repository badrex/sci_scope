The integrals are derived from Kirchhoff's method and can represent disturbances as due to two types of sources: Hertzian vibrators and sources with interchanged electric and magnetic forces. The author also discusses the application of these integrals to problems of diffraction and the communication of electrical oscillations from condensers and vibrators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Waves"}
