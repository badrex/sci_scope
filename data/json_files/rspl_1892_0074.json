The study shows that the instability is not solely due to viscosity but is influenced by the action of the boundary on the liquid. The results indicate that the tendency to instability increases with velocity, tube radius, and coefficient of sliding friction, while it decreases with viscosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics"}
