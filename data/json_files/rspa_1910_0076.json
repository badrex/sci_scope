The process involves the movement of sand grains towards the middle of the water due to the push and pull effect of the water's oscillation, leading to the formation of a primary ridge and subsequent ripples.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geomorphology"}
