The theory is applied to various phenomena, including diffusion, viscosity, and heat conduction, leading to the determination of coefficients and the prediction of gas behavior in different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
