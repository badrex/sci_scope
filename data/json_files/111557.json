He presents exact and approximate formulas for the work of steam, considering the expansion with heat and efficiency in producing motive power. The study confirms the theoretical conclusion that a portion of steam must be liquefied during expansion, and the steam-jacket invented by Watt prevents this liquefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Thermodynamics"}
