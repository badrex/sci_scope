The study compares the initial movements of magnetic elements at various observatories and finds that these movements are often simultaneous, suggesting a global connection between magnetic disturbances and earth currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
