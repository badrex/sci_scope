The author establishes a more general theory for determining the character of equations of any order and applies it to the quartic and quintic equations. The article also discusses the Tschirnhausen transformation and the canonical form used in the investigation of the quintic equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
