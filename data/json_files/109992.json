He conducts experiments in Regent's Park to determine the dip of the magnetic needle in London, resulting in a mean dip of 70\u00b003'. Sabine emphasizes the importance of avoiding local attractions and using suitable locations for accurate magnetic observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
