He conducts experiments on a rabbit's stomach and concludes that a significant amount of unsaturated muriatic acid exists during digestion. Prout also infers that muriatic acid performs the same function in the human stomach.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Anatomy"}
