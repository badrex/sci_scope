The study provides experimental evidence for the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory effects on vaso-constrictor and vaso-dilator nerves, contributing to a better understanding of vascular regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
