The study reveals that the semi-diurnal variation is likely due to temperature oscillations and that the wave velocity is influenced by the extent to which the temperature gradient deviates from the convective value.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
