The study reveals that the intensity of reflection decreases as the refractive indices of the media approach equality, and when they are equal, reflection ceases, and the ray continues in the second medium unchanged.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
