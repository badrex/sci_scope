Slare, conducts a series of experiments to study the properties of phosphorus and its relation to lightning. He observes that phosphorus emits flashes of light in warm weather and discusses the differences between the effects of phosphorus and lightning on combustible materials. Slare also explores the chemical reactions between various liquids and their potential to produce fire and light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Analysis"}
