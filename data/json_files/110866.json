He finds that a mechanical force equivalent to raising 823 pounds one foot is required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. This supports the dynamical theory of heat, which posits that heat is a form of energy, rather than a material substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Energy Conversion"}
