These formations indicate that either this form is a rare feature of prominence material or that the envelopes seldom appear broadside-on on the limb, allowing the arch system to be fully displayed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
