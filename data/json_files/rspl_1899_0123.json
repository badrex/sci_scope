He also hypothesizes that contact sensitiveness is a periodic function of an element's atomic weight and that radiation causes molecular changes or allotropic modifications in the substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
