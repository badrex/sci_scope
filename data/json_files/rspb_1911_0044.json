The research examines the transmission of cancer liability from parents to offspring and analyzes the impact of cancerous ancestors on the likelihood of developing cancer. The findings suggest a significant difference in cancer rates between mice with recent cancerous ancestry and those with more remote cancerous ancestry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Heredity"}
