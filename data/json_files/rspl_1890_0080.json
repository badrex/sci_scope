Bowmanites, a plant with an articulated stem and fructification, has distinctive reproductive organs. Chiopteris ramosa, a Pterid-like organism, may be a more developed form of Rachiopteris hirsuta.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Paleobotany"}
