He investigates the role of elastic fluids, or inflammable air, and their nature during the conversion process. The experiments provide insights into the chemical reactions and factors affecting the transformation of cast iron into a more malleable form.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
