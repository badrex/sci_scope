He compares it to the curdling agent in the stomach, suggesting that they may be the same ferment. The study contributes to the understanding of digestion and the role of the pancreas in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
