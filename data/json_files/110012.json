He describes the complex joints and articulations that allow for great motion in the neck without injury to the spinal marrow. The author also discusses the prevention of compression of the spinal marrow during various neck motions and the correspondence between the extent of motion and the size and form of the canal in the human spine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
