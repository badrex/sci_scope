They investigate the reaction of light passing through suspensions of finely divided sulfur and find that the transmitted light changes from red to blue, indigo, and finally white. The research provides insights into the growth of particles and their effect on light transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
