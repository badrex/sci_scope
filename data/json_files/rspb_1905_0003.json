They find that the rate of absorption is directly related to the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide in the air, and that the method provides accurate results when certain precautions are taken.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences"}
