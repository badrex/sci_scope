They observe three strong, sharp lines characteristic of boron and a strong spectrum with a group of lines attributed to silicon. The wave-lengths of these lines are measured and compared to other spectra for verification.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
