This phenomenon, called star-drift, suggests that certain stars may form distinct systems related to the galactic system. The author also discusses the implications of these findings on the understanding of the solar motion and the possible center of the sidereal system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics"}
