The authors find that while some plants contain a cyanogen glucoside and the corresponding enzyme, others do not. They also observe differences in enzymic activity among specimens from various locations, suggesting a correlation between the presence of the cyanophoric glucoside and the enzyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
