He finds that the direction and strength of the needles are not affected by the touch or the type of load-stone, but rather by the nature and temper of the steel used. He also claims to have successfully infused such magnetic virtue into a piece of steel that it can take up a piece of iron and give a needle the ability to conform to the magnetic meridian without the help of a load-stone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
