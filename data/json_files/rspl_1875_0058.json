The author, Wm. Turner, examines the gravid uteri of various lemurs and concludes that their placenta is diffused and non-leciduate. Additionally, William Crookes presents an experiment involving a radiometer, which provides insights into the theory of these obscure actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Anatomy"}
