Faraday, investigates the reaction between sulfuric acid and naphthaline, resulting in a new acid called Sulpho-naphthalic Acid. This acid has distinct properties and forms a new class of salts with different bases. The composition of the acid is determined through a rigorous analysis of its compound with baryta.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Acid-Base Chemistry"}
