Hauksbee", "topics": ["Sound Propagation", "Atmospheric Pressure", "Acoustics", "Experimental Physics", "Condensed Air"], "tldr": "F. Hauksbee conducted experiments at Gresham College and an open field to study sound propagation in condensed air. He found that sound was more effectively propagated in compressed air, and that the sound's intensity increased with the number of atmospheres introduced. However, after a certain point, the sound propagation became less efficient, possibly due to air leakage or inefficient valve operation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Soun"}
