The instrument records the differences in expansion due to heat through a series of multiplying levers and a pencil that marks changes on paper wound around a clock-work driven cylinder.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
