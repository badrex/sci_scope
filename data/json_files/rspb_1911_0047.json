They find that the gibbon's remarkable use of its arms and hands correlates with an expanded cortex in the precentral region, and they confirm their deductions through cortical stimulation and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
