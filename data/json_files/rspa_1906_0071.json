They find that the specific inductive capacity varies among different samples of paper and that the testing methods yield consistent results. The study provides valuable insights into the electrical properties of materials used in telephone cables.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrical Engineering"}
