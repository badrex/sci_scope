The lepra bacillus grows slowly but eventually forms well-formed, acid-fast rods. This method may lead to the development of a vaccine for leprosy and further research on related acid-fast bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Virology"}
