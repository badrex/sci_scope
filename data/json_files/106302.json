Whitehurst's experiments show that metals may become lighter when heated due to the ascent of rarefied air and the expansion of the metal. He also speculates that Buffon's experiment might have been affected by differences in the expansion of the iron mass and the beam it was hung on.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics & Calorimetry"}
