He examines the structure and origin of these deposits, concluding that they were formed by long-term river action rather than a catastrophic event. The author also discusses the differences between high-level and low-level gravels and their respective locations and contents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Stratigraphy"}
