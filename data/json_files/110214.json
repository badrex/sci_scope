He finds that the Pacific is 13.55 feet higher than the Atlantic at mean tides and 6.51 feet lower at low water. The survey also reveals a break in the mountain chain at the narrowest part of the Isthmus, making it an ideal location for a rail-road connection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geography & Topography"}
