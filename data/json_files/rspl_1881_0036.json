They find that electrical stimulation can have varying effects depending on the timing, strength, and location of stimulation. Cold prolongs the systole, refractory period, and latency of induced contractions, while strychnine lengthens the refractory period. Ammonia and its salts, as well as hydrocyanic acid, have different effects on muscle and nerve contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
