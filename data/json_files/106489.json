The lightning passed through a leaden pipe and struck a crank iron, shortening the wire of a night-bolt. The wire was found straight and tight, with a musical tone produced when struck. This instance suggests that lightning often breaks or contracts wires, and the author presents samples for the Royal Society's inspection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
