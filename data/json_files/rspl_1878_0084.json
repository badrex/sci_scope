The results show that the temperature differences between the right and left sides are generally small, with the majority of spaces having equal or nearly equal temperatures. The study provides a detailed analysis of the temperature distribution in the head, which can be useful for understanding human physiology and temperature regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Neuroscience"}
