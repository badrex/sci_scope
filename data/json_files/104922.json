The sheep's horn was so large that it required great strength to move and hold it up, yet the animal was able to adapt to its unusual condition. The stuffed skin of the sheep, with the horn still attached, is now on display in the museum of the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
