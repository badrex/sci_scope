The meteor appeared as a bright, tennis ball-sized ball of fire with a train of blue sparks. It moved in an arc from northwest to southeast and was visible for about two seconds. Colebrooke also mentions that Mr. Peers, another observer, saw a large star fall into a meadow at the same time, suggesting it was a spark from the meteor.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences"}
