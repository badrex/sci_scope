They observe that the dark reversal line in sodium spectra disappears when a magnetic field is applied, and that the effect is proportional to the wavelength. The study also reveals that the magnetic effect is better seen when a nicol is interposed in the path of the light, but is cut off when the nicol is rotated 90 degrees.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Spectroscopy"}
