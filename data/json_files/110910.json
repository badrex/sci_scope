He describes a method for estimating the quantity of ammonia in a solution and the decomposition of hydrocyanic acid and its compounds. Additionally, he explores the use of hypochlorites and chloride of lime for the decomposition of uric acid and as a method for estimating nitrogen in urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
