The author demonstrates that the magnetic force causes ions to be deflected in their free paths, resulting in spirals with axes along the direction of the magnetic force. The rate of diffusion of ions in directions perpendicular to the magnetic force is less than the rate of diffusion in the direction of the force. The study has implications for understanding phenomena in discharge tubes and the behavior of ions under electric forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
