The authors found that the nature of the arterial wall significantly affects the conduction of pressure waves, influencing the shape of sphygmograms and arterial pressure readings taken with a sphygmomanometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Vascular Medicine"}
