The method involves drawing a quadrant of a circle and constructing a chord within it, followed by a series of steps that result in an approximation with an error of less than one-fourth of a thousandth part of the side of a square with the same area.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Geometric Constructions"}
