The first is a green mineral with a prismatic system and nearly approximates the formula of olivine. The second mineral is silica, possibly tridymite, with a distinct crystalline system and lower density than quartz.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineralogy & Petrology"}
