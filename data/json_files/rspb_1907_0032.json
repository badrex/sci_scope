The results show that the uterus undergoes degenerative changes after the removal of ovaries, suggesting a strong interdependence between the two organs. Furthermore, injecting ovarian extract did not prevent uterine degeneration, indicating that the uterus's functions are not solely dependent on ovarian influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproductive Biology & Endocrinology"}
