The results show that both sodic and potassic sulphates have a significant impact on the reaction, with the reaction being accelerated as more sulphate is added. Furthermore, equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have nearly the same working effect, suggesting that their chemical equivalents are equal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Equivalents"}
