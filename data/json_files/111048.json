He discovers that the transpiration velocity of gases is related to their densities and that the transpiration time of gases is inversely proportional to their density. Graham also finds that transpiration is generally promoted by density and that the resistance of a capillary tube to the passage of a gas is directly proportional to the length of the tube.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
