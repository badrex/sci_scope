He constructs a new table by mixing absolute alcohol and distilled water in fixed proportions and determining their specific gravity. The table is useful for understanding the fermentation of sugar and molasses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis"}
