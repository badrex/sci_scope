He observes their industriousness in constructing their nests and compares their methods to those of honeybees. He also notes the appearance of larger, presumably queen wasps, and speculates on their role in the colony's reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Behavior"}
