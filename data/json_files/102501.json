The experiment shows that stopping respiration leads to blood stagnation in the lungs and vital organs, proving that respiration is essential for life and plays a crucial role in maintaining blood flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
