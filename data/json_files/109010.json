Dupr\u00e9 and F.J.M. Page, investigate the specific heat of mixtures of ethylic alcohol and water. They find that the specific heat of these mixtures, up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%, is higher than the specific heat of water, which has always been considered to possess the highest specific heat of any substance solid or liquid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
