This discovery supports the idea that carbonate of lime is deposited from sea-water in these areas, contributing to the formation of sandstone. The author also discusses the implications of these findings for steam navigation and suggests further research on the proportion of sulfate of lime in different parts of the ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Chemistry"}
