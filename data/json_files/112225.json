He demonstrates that the probabilities of ideal events can be determined when the original data supply the conditions of a possible experience, and that the final probability lies within the limits it would have if determined by actual observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Probability & Statistics"}
