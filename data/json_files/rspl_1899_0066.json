The authors determine the equilibrium curve for the liquid alloys and the solid bodies that can form in them. They identify seven substances in the solid alloys and three eutectic points. The research also examines the microscopic structure of the alloys and compares the effectiveness of surface photographs and R\u00f6ntgen-ray photographs in revealing the alloy's structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
