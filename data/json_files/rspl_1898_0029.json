The instrument consists of a wooden chamber lined with copper, with a system of fans to mix the air inside and a mass of ice to absorb the heat. The design allows for accurate measurement of the heat emitted by a person, with potential applications in understanding human metabolism and energy expenditure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Metabolism"}
