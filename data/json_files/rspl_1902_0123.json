They discover that the angles in these crystals change during growth and that the faces are not simple indices but vicinal planes slightly inclined to them. This study may lead to a better understanding of the conditions of equilibrium between crystals and solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Crystallography"}
