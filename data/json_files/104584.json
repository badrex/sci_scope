This challenges previous theories that Belemnitae were either vegetable, animal, or mineral in origin. The author presents evidence, such as the arrangement of the attached marine organisms and the growth patterns of the shells, to support their argument.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Fossil Record"}
