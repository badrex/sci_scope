They find that the blood volume can be better expressed as a function of the body surface area rather than as a percentage of body weight, and that lighter animals have a relatively greater blood volume than heavier ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathology"}
