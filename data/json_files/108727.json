They describe the preparation and properties of cyanide of ethylene and propylene, and their reactions with potash to form the desired acids. The process provides a new method for creating complex organic compounds and expands the understanding of organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Synthesis"}
