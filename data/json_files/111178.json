Grove's experiments demonstrate that the polarity of gases affects the oxidation and reduction of metals during electrical discharges. The author explains that the gas surrounding the electrodes becomes chemically polarized before each discharge, leading to different reactions depending on the gas composition and electrode polarity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
