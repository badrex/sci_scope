He demonstrates that contact of dissimilar metals is not necessary for producing galvanic action and that voltaic and common electricity have distinct differences. Ritchie also investigates the fundamental principles and laws of action of the voltaic battery, finding that voltaic energies are proportional to the square root of the number of plates within certain limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Energy Storage"}
