The study suggests that the Earth's internal constitution is not significantly involved in these phenomena, except in determining the surface effects arising from tidal or rotational stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
