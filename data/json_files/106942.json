He explores the refractive power of the lens and its ability to correct spherical aberration, as well as the potential for achromatic lenses in improving vision. The author also shares his experiments on a patient who had a cataract operation, providing valuable insights into the function of the crystalline lens in the human eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
