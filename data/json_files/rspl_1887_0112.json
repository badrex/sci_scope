The researchers found that the representation of head and eye movements, lower limb movements, and upper limb movements are located in specific areas of the brain. The study provides insights into the complex organization of the motor region and its role in controlling different body movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
