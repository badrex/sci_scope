He suggests that air consists of different types of matter, and that the particles can be forced through glass. The author also explores the phenomenon of air pressure and its effects on water, but is unable to find a satisfactory explanation for a particular observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
