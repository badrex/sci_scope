The results show that the addition of Azotobacter chroococcum to the culture solution increases the rate of multiplication and size of the plants, while the control plants experience a decrease in weight. The study also suggests that nucleic acid derivatives from raw peat may play a role in the observed growth promotion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
