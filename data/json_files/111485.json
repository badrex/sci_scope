He presents equations for the transmission of sound through a column of air, taking into account the compressibility of air and the impact of internal resistance and friction. The author also discusses the role of the ear in detecting sound, suggesting that only aerial rarefactions can stimulate the human ear.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Vibration"}
