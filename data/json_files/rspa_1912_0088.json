The experiments reveal that the lateral diffusion of ions increases significantly as the pressure decreases and the electric force increases, suggesting an abnormal increase in the rate of diffusion and the mean kinetic energy of translation of the ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical and Optical Physics"}
