Faraday, discovers a method to convert solid hydrate chlorine into a liquid state by exposing it to a temperature of about 100 degrees Celsius. He also discusses the properties of liquid chlorine, such as its specific gravity and its behavior when pressure is removed. Additionally, Sir Humphry Davy shares his findings on obtaining muriatic acid in a liquid form and suggests the possibility of other gases being condensed using a similar method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry"}
