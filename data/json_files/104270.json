The cause is attributed to the ground's situation and the nature of the soil, with a light earth layer on top and a moist clay layer beneath. This event serves as a cautionary tale for the potential dangers of such geological occurrences.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Soil Studies"}
