He presents a method for expressing the coefficients of the inequalities corresponding to a given order in terms of the coefficients of the inferior orders, which can be used to analyze the effects of planetary perturbations on the motion of celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Dynamics"}
