The authors describe their experimental setup, methods, and results, including temperature and humidity readings at various heights. They found that using a steam vessel for kite operations was advantageous, as it allowed for more ascents in calmer weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
