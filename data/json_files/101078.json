The experiments reveal that the compression of air is directly proportional to the depth of immersion in saltwater. This information can be useful for divers and those using diving bells for underwater exploration and recovery of lost items.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrology"}
