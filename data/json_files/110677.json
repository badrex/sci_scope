He finds that during the lunar cycle, the last quarter is associated with higher barometer readings and better weather, while the new moon is linked to lower barometer readings, increased temperature, and more rainfall.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
