The study reveals that wire-drawing can transform some iron-nickel alloys from non-magnetic to magnetic conditions, while the magnetic properties of manganese steel cannot be restored through this process. The research also highlights the differences in specific resistance, thermo-electric height, and magnetic permeability among the various alloys and metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Alloy Development"}
