Gordon investigates the effects of electrostatic stress on glass and discovers new optical phenomena, including an orange-brown patch of light, concentric rings, and a large black cross on a faintly luminous background. These phenomena occur before the glass is perforated, and Gordon plans to further study them before the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
