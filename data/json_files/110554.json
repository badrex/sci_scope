He finds that the temperature of insects varies depending on their stage of life, activity level, and species. The author also explores the influence of various factors, such as inactivity, sleep, and hybernation, on the temperature of insects and their respiration. He concludes that animal heat is not an effect of nervous influence but rather results directly from the changes that occur during respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
