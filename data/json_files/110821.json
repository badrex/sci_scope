He also refutes the idea of cells as the basis for fibrous, cartilaginous, and osseous tissues, suggesting that the cellular appearance in these structures is due to spaces within the solid substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Developmental Biology"}
