T. Desaguliers conducts an experiment to demonstrate that bodies of the same bulk do not contain equal quantities of matter, proving the existence of interspersed vacuum. He does this by comparing the heat transfer between equal volumes of mercury and water, showing that more heat is communicated by warm mercury than an equal bulk of water, indicating the presence of more matter in the mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics"}
