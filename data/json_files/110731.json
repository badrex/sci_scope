He finds that the barometrical mean is depressed when the moon's declination is south of the equator and that there is a gradual depression as the moon moves from full north declination to crossing the equator. He also discovers a cycle of 18 years in the mean pressure of the atmosphere, which increases and decreases over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
