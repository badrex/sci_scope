The study reveals that the ratios of sunspot frequency to areas are higher during sunspot maxima, indicating that Wolf's method overestimates sunspot activity when it is low and underestimates it when it is high. The author also introduces the periodogram as a tool for analyzing sunspot variability and discusses its applications and limitations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Astrophysics"}
