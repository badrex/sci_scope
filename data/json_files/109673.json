He tests different battery designs and electrolytes, finding that a large number of small plates with a certain distance between them is necessary for overcoming resistance in imperfect conductors, while large plates are needed for igniting perfect conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
