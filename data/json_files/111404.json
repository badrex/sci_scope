The author derives equations of motion for these problems and applies them to a specific scenario involving a heavy chain hanging over the edge of a table, demonstrating the motion of the chain under the influence of gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Dynamics"}
