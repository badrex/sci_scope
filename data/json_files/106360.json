The author, William Henly, investigates various phenomena related to electricity and magnetism, providing evidence that the electric fluid does not permeate glass and that bodies are affected differently by the fluid acting through glass or directly.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
