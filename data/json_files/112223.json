Using synthermal tables, the author demonstrates temperature differences between places in the same latitude and the existence of hot and cold spaces within continents compared to surrounding oceans.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
