The study focuses on the six-laminated and five-laminated cortex types and their differences in cellular conformation and distribution. The findings suggest that the anatomical structure of the cortex is related to the complexity and independence of motor functions in different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
