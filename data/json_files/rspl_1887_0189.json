They examine various cells, including Becquerel's 'pile a oxygene,' and observe continuous evolution of oxygen and hydrogen depending on the composition of the fluids. Their findings contribute to the understanding of electrochemical processes and the development of electromotors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
