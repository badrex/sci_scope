He finds that tartrate of ammonia has no significant impact on urine acidity, while carbonate of ammonia slightly reduces it. The study highlights the differences between the actions of volatile and fixed alkalis on urine acidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Health"}
