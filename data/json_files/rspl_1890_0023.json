The authors find that bile salts, such as taurocholate and glycocholate, enhance the amylolytic action of pancreatic enzymes on starch. They also observe that carbonate of sodium, when present in certain proportions, can retard pancreatic digestion, both with and without the presence of bile salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
