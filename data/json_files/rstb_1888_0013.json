The research examines the formation of the heart, the growth of the cardiac loops, and the role of vitelline veins in the development of the pericardium. The findings contribute to the understanding of the cardiovascular system's development in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
