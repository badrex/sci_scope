This resistance is not due to vital properties, but rather the mechanical properties of the albumen. The author also finds that other substances do not possess this property, suggesting it is an adaptation to preserve eggs from the loss of their capacity for development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
