They find that bacteria dried in this manner can survive for extended periods, with some remaining viable for several months. The study also highlights the importance of considering chemical changes when studying the nature of bacterial processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
