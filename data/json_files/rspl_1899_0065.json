The author suggests that Heliopora has descended from the Paleozoic Heliolitidae by degeneration in size and an increase in the number of coenenchymal caeca. Polytremacis, a genus of eocene and cretaceous corals, is considered as a connecting link between the two genera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Paleobiology"}
