He investigates the composition of fluoric acid and its compounds, and through experiments, he proposes that fluoric acid is composed of hydrogen and a unique principle called fluorine, similar to chlorine. Davy also explores the properties of fluates and their decomposition, suggesting that fluorine may be a gaseous element.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
