Dextrin is found to be an effective source of energy for both organisms, and basic slag proves to be a better neutralizing agent than chalk, with a stimulative effect on nitrogen fixation nearly equal to that of humus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
