They find that temperature plays a significant role in the injury current, with both extreme temperatures reducing the current's value. A mean temperature exists where the injury E.M.F. is best maintained, and this temperature range is found to be between 14\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
