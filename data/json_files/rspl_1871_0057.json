The authors find that this deposition occurs when oxygen is present and is accompanied by a corresponding dissolution of copper. They also explore the possibility of replacing elements in the reaction and discuss the initiation of the chemical change near the more negative metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Corrosion Science"}
