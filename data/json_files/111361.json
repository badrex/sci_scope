He discovers that quinidin possesses fluorescence, while cinchonidin does not. The author also describes the formation and properties of various crystal forms of these compounds, including their optical doubly absorbent powers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
