Papin, describes an improvement to the Hessian Bellows by changing the shape of the Tympanum to a spiral, which allows for better airflow and reduced friction. This new design can be used for wind and water applications and has potential for various other uses, such as coal-mine ventilation and furnace work.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics"}
