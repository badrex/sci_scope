The observations were conducted on board the ships Erebus and Terror, and the data collected was used to deduce the constants a and b for the corrections of the ship's attraction. The study provides insights into the changes in magnetic conditions during the expedition and the impact of the ship's magnetic properties on the observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
