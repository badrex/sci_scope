They find that the rate of decomposition is influenced by the state of the globe and the temperature, with the highest rate occurring at 1111\u00b0C. The results confirm previous observations that decomposition is never absolutely complete, but is negligible after heating at 1100\u00b0C for a short time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
