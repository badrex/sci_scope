He finds that congelation is fatal to animal life and discusses the possible causes of death, such as the freezing of organs and changes in blood corpuscles. The author also examines the effects of freezing on the crystalline lens, muscles, and other organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathology"}
