The method involves monitoring the change in conductivity of a solution containing an ester and a caustic alkali during the saponification process. The author demonstrates the method using the saponification of methyl acetate by caustic soda and provides a velocity constant for the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
