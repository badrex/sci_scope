They find that two sub-races of albinoes exist, one clotting upon intravascular injection of nucleo-proteids and the other not. The study also examines the behavior of nucleo-proteids from testes in solution and their effect on coagulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
