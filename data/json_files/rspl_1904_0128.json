The study also reveals the complex nature of the phenomena observed, which can be quantitatively separated and analyzed, providing a physico-mathematical basis for understanding these light-induced reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
