He introduces the concept of frequency curves and their applications in various fields, including physics, anthropology, and economics. Pearson also categorizes abnormal frequency curves into three distinct classes and provides methods for dissecting these curves into components.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Statistical Analysis & Applications"}
