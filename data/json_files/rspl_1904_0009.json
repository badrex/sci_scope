They provide an analytical solution and discuss the acoustic shadow created by the sphere, as well as the extension of their calculations to different directions and ratios of wave-length to circumference.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Wave Propagation"}
