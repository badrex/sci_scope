By assuming a resistance varying as the cube of the velocity, the author finds a near-perfect agreement with the results of observation, confirming previous work by Professor H\u00fclle and Professor Bashforth.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Aerospace & Aeronautics"}
