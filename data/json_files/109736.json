The whale's eardrum is convex and has no connection with the malleus, while a membranous fold across the eardrum cavity may help transmit sound vibrations unaffected by pressure differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
