The study also highlights the errors that can arise from applying the mass action equation in the usual way and emphasizes the importance of accurate initial readings and temperature control in such experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
