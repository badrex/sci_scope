He presents a new method for estimating small magnitudes and introduces a new test for microscopes, which displays bright and sharp black lines. The paper also explores the use of various immersion fluids and offers solutions for achieving high-definition images in challenging cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Cell Biology"}
