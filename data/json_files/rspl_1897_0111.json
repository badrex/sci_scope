He discovers a (J-shaped distribution and applies the theory of skew variation to describe this novel form of frequency. The study demonstrates the capacity of the theory to cover unusual types of frequency distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
