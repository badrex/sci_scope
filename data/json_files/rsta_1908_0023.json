The results show that the metallic lines are inclined at each electrode, indicating the velocity of the metallic vapor's propagation. The discharge is oscillatory, with a period large enough for the oscillations to be visible.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
