He observes that herbivorous Trachelipoda are abundant in older formations, while carnivorous ones are more common in strata above the chalk. The author also speculates that a decrease in Earth's temperature may have led to the extinction of some genera and the migration of others to the south.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Stratigraphy"}
