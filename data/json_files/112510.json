The study focuses on the mathematical conditions required for a stable motion and the different types of governors, including those that use centrifugal force, liquid, or viscosity to regulate the machine's speed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Control Systems"}
