The study finds that the resistance varies as the cube of the velocity, with a coefficient of resistance of 0.00000 02723 for a specific bullet. This research provides valuable insights into the physics of projectile motion and the design of rifles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics"}
