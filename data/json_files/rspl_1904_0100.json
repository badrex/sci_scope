The density of nitrous oxide is determined to be higher than previously thought, with the excess likely due to the departure of nitrous oxide from Boyle's law between atmospheric pressure and great rarefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
