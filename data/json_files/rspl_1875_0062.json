The study finds that bile acids can cause a slowing of the pulse through their action on cardiac ganglia and the muscular walls of the heart, rather than through the influence of the vagus nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Internal Medicine"}
