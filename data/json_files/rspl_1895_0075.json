The author defines two particular functions and provides representations of these functions by series, as well as expressions for the functions in terms of integrals and powers of the variables.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics"}
