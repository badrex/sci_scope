The experiment demonstrates the potential for creating artificial springs for various purposes, such as improving land and providing water at a higher level than traditional wells.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrogeology & Groundwater"}
