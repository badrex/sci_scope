The author highlights the importance of considering both external and internal conditions, such as temperature changes and previous treatments, to accurately measure these processes. The research emphasizes the need for uniformity in environmental conditions and the after-effects of these conditions on plant functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
