The results indicate that the amount of solution absorbed at equilibrium is determined by the difference between the inside and outside concentrations, with the equilibrium point being lower, equal to, or higher than for pure water depending on the inside solution's strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Science & Botany"}
