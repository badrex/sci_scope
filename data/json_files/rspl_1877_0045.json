The study uses a modified insulation method and a condenser with a single operative metal-liquid contact to measure the potential differences. Results show that copper is positive to distilled water, while zinc and copper are nearly at the same potential when dipped in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry of Interfaces"}
