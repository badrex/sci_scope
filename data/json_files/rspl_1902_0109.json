They discuss the statolith theory proposed by Nemec and Haberlandt, which suggests that statoliths, heavy bodies within plant cells, provide the stimulus for geotropism. The author presents experimental evidence supporting and questioning the theory, ultimately concluding that the loss of starch may be a symptom of exhaustion affecting both geotropic and heliotropic responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
