He discovered a fibrous structure in the humor and believed it to be responsible for the eye's ability to adjust focus. Hunter's experiments and observations on the crystalline humor's muscular action are detailed, including his work on the cuttlefish eye as a model for human eye structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
