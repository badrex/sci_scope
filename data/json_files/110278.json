He found that the vibrations of Captain Kater's pendulum at 57\u00b0 were 86,069.1, and at 62\u00b0, they were 86,066.9. The length of the seconds' pendulum in a vacuum would be 39.13734 inches at 62\u00b0.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Classical Physics"}
