They observe that exposure to direct sunlight and increased temperature may affect the growth of prothalli, and discuss the implications of these findings on the nature of alternation of generations in archegoniate plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
