William Siemens, develops a new instrument called the Bathometer to measure sea depth without the use of a sounding-line. The Bathometer works by detecting slight variations in total gravitation due to the depth of the sea. The author also describes an attraction-meter, which measures horizontal attractions and can be used in conjunction with the Bathometer. These instruments have potential applications in navigation, oceanography, and the study of ocean currents and temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Geophysics"}
