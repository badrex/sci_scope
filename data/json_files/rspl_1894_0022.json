The research finds that both diastase and invertase are present in pollen grains, and their amounts increase during germination. The pollen tube is nourished by reserve materials from both the grain itself and the style, with enzymes playing a role in digestion and absorption of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
