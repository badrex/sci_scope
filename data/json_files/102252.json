Flamsteed, provides a detailed account of the ingress and egress of Jupiter's satellites into and out of its shadow, as observed from the Greenwich Observatory in 1683. These observations are crucial for determining longitude and are calculated using new tables. The author also discusses the challenges of observing these events with telescopes of limited capabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics"}
