It finds that selection reduces ancestral and fraternal correlations, while assortative mating increases both parental and sibling correlations. The study also reveals that the value of 0.5 for fraternal and parental correlations in random samples of a Mendelian population is independent of the sample being random, but rather depends on the frequency of heterozygotes in the population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Heredity"}
