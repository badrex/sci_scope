The results confirm the use of Callendar's difference formula for reducing platinum thermometer readings to the normal scale and show that the instruments' readings are in reasonably close agreement with the gas thermometer up to 1000\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
