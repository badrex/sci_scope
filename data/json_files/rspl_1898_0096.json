The results show that the boiling point is lowered, but the observed temperature is higher than expected, leading to questions about the thermometer's accuracy and the efficiency of heat isolation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
