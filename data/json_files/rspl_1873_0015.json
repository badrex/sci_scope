The phenomenon is caused by the combined influence of helical and axial electric currents, and is related to both magnetism and sound. The direction of the torsion depends on the direction of the currents, with left-handed torsion produced by a current flowing from north to south and right-handed torsion by a reverse current. The phenomenon can be used as a test and measure of the residual effects of electric currents in iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
