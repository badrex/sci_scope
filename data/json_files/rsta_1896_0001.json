The study suggests that dense gases exhibit a tendency for spheres to move together in masses or streams, affecting the mean pressure and the number of collisions per unit of volume and time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics"}
