They determine the chemical activity and electric force within these columns, finding that the observed chemical effects are not due to recombination of ions or internal radiation. The results support the theory that the chemical effects are a result of the motion of negative ions in the presence of an electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
