He proposes a method to measure irritability and demonstrates that animals in hybernation have a higher degree of irritability compared to their active states. The study also highlights the differences between hybernation and torpor induced by excessive cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Behavior"}
