They find that the solubility of carbonate of magnesia in these waters is influenced by the presence of carbonate of soda, and that alkaline springs may be formed through the slow decomposition of felspathic debris in the presence of earthy carbonates.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth & Environmental Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Mineralogy"}
