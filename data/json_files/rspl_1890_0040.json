The author suggests that these earthquakes were caused by impulsive friction from slips in the Earth's crust and provides insights into the differences between British and Swiss earthquakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Studies"}
