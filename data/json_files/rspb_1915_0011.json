They also discover that certain sounds are audible with a stethoscope when pressure in an armlet is raised, which they believe are related to the pulse-pressure range of the bloodstream.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Vascular Medicine"}
