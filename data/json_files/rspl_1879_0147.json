This state occurs when molecules are rarefied to the point where their mean free path is comparable to the dimensions of the containing vessel, resulting in a loss of gaseous properties. He also speculates that matter is a mode of motion and that molecules, rather than the collective assemblage, are the true form of matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Molecular Physics & Gas Dynamics"}
