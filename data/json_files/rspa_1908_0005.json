The study finds that disturbed days exhibit a distinct regular diurnal variation, and investigates the relationship between absolute ranges and sunspot areas to explore theories on the origin of magnetic storms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
