The instrument records the combined effects of temperature and pressure, allowing for accurate depth and temperature measurements, even in the presence of currents and other disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Science"}
