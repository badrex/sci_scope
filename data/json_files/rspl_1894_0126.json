Dixon and J. Joly, investigate the ascent of sap in plants and the role of transpiration in this process. They find that the leaf's transpiration activity is capable of bringing water to the surface against high atmospheric pressures. The authors propose that the capillary action of the tracheal tissue and the stable state of the liquid sap, due to its stretched internal stability and the structure of the conducting tissue, are responsible for the ascent of sap in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
