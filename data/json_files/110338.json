They also demonstrate that bile can be secreted from both arterial and venous blood and that chyle can be formed in the absence of bile. The author concludes that bile's primary function is not in chyle formation but serves another purpose in the digestive and metabolic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
