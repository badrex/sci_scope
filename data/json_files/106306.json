The first theorem states that the sum of perpendiculars drawn from angular points to parallel lines is equal, while the second theorem shows that the intercepted parts of the parallels are equal to the corresponding sides multiplied by the cosine of the sums of exterior angles.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
