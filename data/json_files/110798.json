Hall examines the structure and function of the iris through microscopic analysis in various animals. He concludes that the radiated plicae are not muscular and are similar in structure to ciliary processes. The iris consists of two parts: a vascular tissue and a layer of concentric muscular fibers. Hall also discusses the limitations of current knowledge in explaining the iris's contraction and dilation and suggests that vital contractility may be involved in dilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
