He introduces a new thermometer and observes that the cooling effect is not solely due to the dissolution process but also influenced by the nature of the salts and their interactions with the surrounding liquid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Salt Chemistry"}
