He demonstrates that the force of double refraction and polarization emanates from the surface of bodies, and the intensity depends on the inclination of the surface to the crystal's axis. Brewster also shows that the ordinary or extraordinary image can be extinguished in a doubly-refracting crystal, converting it into a singly-refracting crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
