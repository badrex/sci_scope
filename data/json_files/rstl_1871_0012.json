The study reveals that 1859 was a year of maximum disturbance, while 1863 and 1864 were years of minimum disturbance. The findings show a correlation with the decennial variation in solar spots.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
