Bismuth dissolves in zinc at a higher rate of 2.4-14.3%. The results suggest that when lead and zinc or bismuth and zinc are fused together in proportions greater than their solubility, the resulting alloys can be considered mechanical mixtures of the dissolved metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
