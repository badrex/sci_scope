They observe and classify various patterns, such as mazes, straight axes, concentric or wave lines, feathery tufts, vesicular structures, and contraction structures, and discuss the factors influencing their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Sedimentology"}
