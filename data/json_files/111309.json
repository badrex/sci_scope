Bird Herapath shares his research on detecting trace amounts of strychnia using the formation of iodostrychnia. The method involves using a polarizing microscope to identify the optical crystals formed after applying heat and a reagent. This new test for strychnia is of considerable interest to toxicologists.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Toxicology"}
