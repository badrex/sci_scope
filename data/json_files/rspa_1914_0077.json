They find that the amount of gas absorbed is related to the quantity of electricity passing through the circuit and the pressure of the gas. The results suggest that chemical compounds form between the gases and the metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
