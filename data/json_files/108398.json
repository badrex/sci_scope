Elliot conducted a magnetic survey of the Eastern Archipelago, determining the position of magnetic lines such as the line of no dip and the line of minimum intensity. He established sixteen fixed stations across the region and took hourly observations of the earth's magnetism. The survey aimed to understand the magnetic and meteorological phenomena in the area and provide valuable data for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
