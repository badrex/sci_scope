He concludes that teeth contain bony portions formed of minute tubes, which are surrounded by a transparent material and cemented together. The study also reveals the presence of a granular substance and a crusta petrosa, both of which contribute to the tooth's structure and vitality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
