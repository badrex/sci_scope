The results show a marked increase in the conductivities of ice, naphthaline, aniline, and nitrophenol at low temperatures, while glycerine has a maximum conductivity around 0\u00b0C. Paraffin wax exhibits a similar tendency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
