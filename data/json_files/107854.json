The experiments reveal that the best conductors have the least attraction for the electric fluid, and the repulsive energy between similar atoms of the electric fluid is the prime mover in conduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
