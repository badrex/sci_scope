The study includes visual and photographic observations, as well as a comparison of the Nova's spectrum with hydrogen, helium, and air spark spectra. The findings indicate that the period of variability is increasing, and the color of the Nova varies periodically with the change in magnitude.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
