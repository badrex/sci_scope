He concludes that cretinism is not caused by snow-water or waters impregnated with calcareous matter, but rather by the confined and dirty living conditions in certain valleys. The author suggests that removing children from these conditions to more open and airy areas can prevent the disorder, and that the number of cretins has decreased in recent years as a result of this intervention.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Public Health & Epidemiology"}
