Melvil, explores the cause of different refraction in light rays and proposes that the varying colors are projected with different velocities from the light source. He also discusses the implications of this theory on the velocity of light and the intervals of the fits of reflexion and transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
