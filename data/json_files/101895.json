The new compass needle is created using a steel ring with brass cap and a small fleur-de-lis, which can be used to detect changes in magnetic poles similar to those observed in the Earth and loadstones.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
