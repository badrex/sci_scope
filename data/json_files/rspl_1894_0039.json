They found a final mean result of 6200\u00b0C and discussed various factors affecting the measurement, such as the law connecting radiation and temperature, emissive power of platinum, and atmospheric absorption. The study suggests that a more systematic series of investigations in tropical regions could provide valuable insights into the solar temperature variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
