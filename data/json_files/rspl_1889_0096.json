Frankland and Grace C. Frankland, successfully isolate the nitrifying organism responsible for the process of nitrification, which was previously thought to be dependent on specific microorganisms. They discover a unique bacillus that refuses to grow in gelatine but thrives in broth, and they study its characteristics and growth patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microorganisms"}
