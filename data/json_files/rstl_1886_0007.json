They use spectroscopy to analyze the spectra of various tissues and organs in invertebrates and vertebrates, discovering similarities in the spectra of organs and tissues, regardless of the presence of circulating haemoglobin in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
