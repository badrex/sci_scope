This theory is based on known facts and Coulomb's experimental researches, and aligns with Poisson's mathematical theory. The author plans to extend this work to include magnetic induction in ferromagnetic and diamagnetic substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
