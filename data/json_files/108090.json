The study provides a formula to calculate the diurnal inequality and its effects on tide heights, with the epoch and multiplier varying depending on the location and time of year.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
