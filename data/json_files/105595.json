The meteor appeared as a dark column extending towards the zenith, with a pale yellow hue and rugged edges. It temporarily obscured the moon and was likely a water spout. The event made a significant impression on the local population, and a storm of rain and hail followed the next morning.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
