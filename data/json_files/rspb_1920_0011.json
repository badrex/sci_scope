They argue that the source of nitrogen utilized by plants does not come from the soil, but rather from the air, and that this process is a photosynthetic one that converts sunlight energy into chemical form as nitrites in the green cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
