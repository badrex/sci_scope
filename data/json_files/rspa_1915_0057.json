The results indicate that the loss of material per coulomb decreases with increasing current for long arcs, while for short arcs, the loss increases with current. The study also shows that the loss of material is greater from the anode than the cathode under similar conditions of arc length and current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Plasma Physics"}
