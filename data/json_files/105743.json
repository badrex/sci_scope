He presents experiments and observations that support the existence of two types of electricity, one that increases and one that decreases the electric fluid, and argues for the nature of these types based on their effects on the appearance of light in the tubes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
