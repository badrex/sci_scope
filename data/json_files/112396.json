They find that the widening of spectral lines is due to pressure, and suggest that the sun's photosphere is gaseous rather than solid or liquid, contrary to the prevailing theory at the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
