He uses a rotating mirror to analyze the speed of the electric spark and finds that the velocity of transmission exceeds the speed of light. The experiments also reveal that the duration of the spark is extremely short, less than the J,152,000th part of a second.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
