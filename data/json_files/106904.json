The results show that air can lose a portion of its natural electricity due to factors such as respiration, putrefaction, and other environmental influences, leading to changes in its electrical state.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
