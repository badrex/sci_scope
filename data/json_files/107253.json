He finds that the canal is lined with a membrane resembling the tunica arachnoidea and is filled with a transparent, colorless fluid. Sewell also demonstrates that the canal provides a continuous pathway from one end of the spinal cord to the other, allowing for communication between the brain and spinal cord.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Comparative Anatomy"}
