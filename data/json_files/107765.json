This discovery supports the theory that a countercurrent beneath the surface carries salt westward into the Atlantic, balancing the salt brought in by the eastward surface current.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Science"}
