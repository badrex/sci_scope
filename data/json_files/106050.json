The study reveals that the air is generally positively electrified during winter and that fog and mist have a significant impact on the electricity of the atmosphere. The author also discusses the behavior of electricity in clouds and the effects of lightning on the electrical state of the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
