He examines the structure of the villi and suggests that they may be similar in humans. He also notes the presence of a cuticle production covering the internal surface of the stomach, which he believes is present in both humans and large animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
