The study provides a comprehensive account of the distribution of both nephrostomes and abdominal pores among adult elasmobranchs, suggesting that the body cavity of these fish is never completely enclosed by the peritoneum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
