The instrument consists of two mutually insulated metallic pieces, which are composed of parallel plates. The author explains its use in conjunction with an idiostatic electrometer for the direct measurement of the capacity of insulated conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
