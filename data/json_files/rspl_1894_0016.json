They find that while insects do not have the same level of visual definition as humans, they have an advantage in examining nearby objects due to the increased number of lenses in their eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
