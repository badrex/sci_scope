The study reveals that measles epidemics have a roughly two-year cycle and that the seasonal prevalence of measles is different from that of scarlet fever. The findings suggest that biological factors, rather than population size, may influence the course of epidemics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Epidemiology & Infectious Diseases"}
