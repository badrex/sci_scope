Despite passing three stones through his urethra, five more required surgical intervention. Upon the patient's death, his bladder contained two more massive stones, and his left kidney had degenerated into mucilage. This case highlights the rarity and challenges of such extreme stone formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Urology & Nephrology"}
