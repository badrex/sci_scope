The phenomenon cannot be attributed to common electrical repulsion or the action of electricity passing from good to bad conductors. The effect appears to be of a novel kind, with similarities to tidal forces, and suggests that the passage of electricity may diminish the action of gravity on mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrochemistry"}
