The research shows that the rate of heat generation diminishes over time, and the heat generation is not caused by the shrinking of the steel. The findings have implications for understanding the thermal properties of steel and its applications in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
