The results show no significant effect of thymus removal on testes growth, and the data contrasts with the effect of castration on thymus growth. The author concludes that any effect of thymus removal on testes growth is likely small and not definitively proven.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
