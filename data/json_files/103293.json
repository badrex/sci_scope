He observes that the notches in a razor can cause tearing and mangle hair roots, and also create visible streaks in muscle fibers. Van Leeuwenhoek also notes the variety in hair structure and the small size of muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
