The study finds that electricity can dissolve uric acid calculi more effectively than oxalate of lime calculi, and that the presence of other compounds, such as urates and phosphates, can also affect the dissolution rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Urology & Nephrology"}
