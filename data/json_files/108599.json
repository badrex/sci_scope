The fibrils connect the dental pulp to the dentine, allowing sensation to be distributed through the tissue. This finding challenges the previous assumption that dentinal tubes are solely for the conveyance of nutrient fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Dental Science & Oral Biology"}
