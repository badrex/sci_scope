This finding challenges previous theories that impregnating influence was transmitted through the envelopes and supports the idea that the spermatozoon's influence is direct and immediate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproductive Biology & Ecology"}
