The patient consented to amputation, but the ossification made the procedure challenging. The author believes that such cases might be more common than realized and could be a cause of extremity mortification in elderly patients.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Surgery & Anatomical Pathology"}
