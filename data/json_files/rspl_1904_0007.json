They find that the absence of testicular secretion due to vas deferens ligation leads to a lack of male secondary sexual characteristics, suggesting that an internal secretion by the testicle plays a crucial role in their development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Animal Physiology & Development"}
