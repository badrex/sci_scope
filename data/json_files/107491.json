The study concludes that the general law of compression can explain the greater density of the Earth's internal parts, and that the resistance of solids to compression is not significantly affected by lateral expansion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
