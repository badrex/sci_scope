They found that the variation of the values of the hourly inequalities of the wind components at Bermuda is less during the hours when the sun is above the horizon than during those when it is below, especially in the winter half-year. The correction involves referring the Bermuda wind observations to astronomical time instead of civil time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
