The results show that the recombination decreases somewhat rapidly with a rise in temperature but less rapidly as the temperature continues to rise. The recombination coefficient is determined at various temperatures, providing insights into the behavior of ions under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
