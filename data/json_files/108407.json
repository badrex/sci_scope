The study reveals that rubian plays a crucial part in the transformation of colourless substances into true colouring matters, and its decomposition products are responsible for the red and yellow hues in madder extracts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Dyeing"}
