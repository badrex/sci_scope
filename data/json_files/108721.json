They develop a method to determine the conditions necessary for a stable flame and measure the chemical action of light from these flames. This research contributes to understanding the effects of solar radiation on chemical changes in the Earth's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
