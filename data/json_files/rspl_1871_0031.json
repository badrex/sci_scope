The author highlights that the mean lunar-diurnal variation has a small range compared to other lunar-diurnal variations and that the semiannual inequality in the lunar-diurnal variation is subject to significant modifications related to the moon's phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
