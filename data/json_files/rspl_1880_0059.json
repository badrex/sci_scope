The author's experiments show that the viscosity remains constant up to a certain point of rarefaction, after which it decreases. This study provides insights into the behavior of gases at low pressures and the role of molecular collisions in their internal friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
