The earthquake was felt in nearby locations such as Havant, Fitchfield, Guernsey, and Jersey. The shaking was accompanied by a noise similar to distant thunder and lasted about 4-5 seconds. The author speculates that the earthquake's energy may have been absorbed by the sea floor, reducing the risk of damage on land.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Studies"}
