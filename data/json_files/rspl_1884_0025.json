The battery is lightweight, portable, and convenient for various purposes. It uses sodium as the electro-positive element and carbon, spongy platinum, copper, or other metallic gauze as the electro-negative element. Atmospheric air, impregnated with moisture, sets up the action of the battery by providing sufficient moisture to wet the surface of the sodium, creating a thin film of fluid between the sodium and the electro-negative element.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Batteries"}
