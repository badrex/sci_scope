Stokes, investigates the phenomenon of light refraction and discovers that the refrangibility of light can change when passing through certain solutions, such as a weak solution of sulphate of quinine. This discovery leads to the identification of true and false internal dispersion, which has significant implications for understanding the behavior of light in various media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
