The study reveals a close agreement between the curves, suggesting that the same cause leading to an increase in mean annual temperature also causes a decrease in solar spot frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate Science"}
