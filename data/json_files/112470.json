The author describes two types of nerve terminations, flabelliform and stapiform, and observes no union between granular contents and sarcous elements. The research also highlights the importance of blood-corpuscles and their role in the movement of living matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Developmental Biology"}
