They find that there is no 'papillary stage' and that teeth develop beneath an unbroken surface of epithelium. The study also reveals the process of tooth development in these animals and the differences in their tooth sacs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
