These bases are found to be powerful alkaline liquids, soluble in water and alcohol, and capable of forming various salts with different properties. The author also examines the platinum and gold salts of these triatomic ammonias.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Coordination Compounds"}
