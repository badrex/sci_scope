He also discusses the use of a newly invented micrometer and a half-second watch to measure the spots' positions and distances from the sun's limb. Although the spots have disappeared, Derham hopes that his work may serve as a foundation for more accurate accounts of solar phenomena by others.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
