The author, William Herschel, conducts experiments on the different types of heat and their corresponding rays, comparing them to the known properties of light. The results show that both solar and terrestrial heat rays are subject to the laws of reflection and refraction, supporting the idea that heat and light are related phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
