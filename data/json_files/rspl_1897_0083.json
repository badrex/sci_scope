The results show that acids and alkalis alter the anodic and cathodic currents, while carbon dioxide primarily causes an augmentation of the cathodic current and a diminution of the anodic current. These findings contribute to our understanding of nerve physiology and electrolytic polarization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
