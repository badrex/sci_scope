They observe that the tumor growth is a phenomenon unparalleled in mammalia and study the growth of tumors at successive stages of 24 hours, finding conjugation of resting nuclei in a tumor removed on the eighth day.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Genetics"}
