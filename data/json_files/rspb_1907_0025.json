The results show that some bacteria can acquire new fermenting powers, challenging the classification of these microorganisms into distinct species or subgroups based solely on their fermentation reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Virology"}
