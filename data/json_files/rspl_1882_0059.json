They propose that the heated wire causes the air to rise, separating it from the dust particles, creating a dark band of clean air. This phenomenon is not due to the evaporation of dust particles or the increase in air density.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
