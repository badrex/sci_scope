This unique structure is preserved even after the diamond has been ground and polished, and it is hypothesized that this may be due to the thinness and ease of exposure of these veins during the grinding process.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineralogy & Crystallography"}
