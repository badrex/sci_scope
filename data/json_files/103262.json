The liquid does not freeze, even in cold weather, and when mixed with water, the water freezes while the liquid remains fluid. The red liquid is found to be slightly heavier than water and maintains a consistent density when frozen. The author also compares the freezing properties of this liquid with a purple liquid made from logwood and allom.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Properties"}
