They identify three types of wandering cells and observe their response to various stimuli, including the injection of anthrax bacilli. The study provides insights into the immune response of frogs and the role of different types of leukocytes in combating infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Pathology"}
