John Blackburn invents a parabolic sounding board that significantly improves the acoustics in Attercliffe Church, allowing for better sound projection and clarity throughout the entire space. The design increases the volume of sound by up to five times and enhances the distinctness of articulation, making it easier for worshippers to hear the preacher from any location in the church.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound Engineering"}
