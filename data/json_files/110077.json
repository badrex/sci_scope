Moll and A. Van Beek, conducted experiments to measure the velocity of sound in Holland using clocks with conical pendulums and advanced equipment. They found that at a temperature of 32\u00b0F, the velocity of sound is 1,089-7,445 English feet per sexagesimal second.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
