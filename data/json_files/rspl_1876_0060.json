The study supports the hypothesis of a universal system of diurnal wind currents affecting the Earth, and the author demonstrates how these currents can cause variations in barometric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
