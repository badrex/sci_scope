He demonstrates that the anterior roots of the spinal nerves are responsible for motion, while the posterior roots are responsible for sensation. This research contributes to a better understanding of the nervous system and its functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
