The observations show that sunspot spectra have thicker absorption bands compared to the surrounding photosphere, suggesting that the phenomena of sunspots are not due to radiation from a source like the one proposed by M. Faye. This supports the absorption hypothesis and provides a possible solution to the problem of sunspot formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
