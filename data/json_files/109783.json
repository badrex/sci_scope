He finds that using a thermometer coated with the substance and placed in a vacuum can produce temperatures as low as -81\u00b0F. This method allows for easy freezing of mercury and can be performed with minimal equipment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
