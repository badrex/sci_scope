He finds that the change is often accompanied by diseased sexual organs and can occur at any age. He also notes that some birds can develop male plumage at a young age, while others may have different plumage due to other factors like dwarfism. Yarrell concludes that external characters in animals can change when their original influences are disrupted.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
