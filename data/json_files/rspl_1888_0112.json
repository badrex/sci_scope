The authors used a specialized chronograph to measure the time it took for the disturbances to travel a set distance in the Pacific Ocean. They found that the velocity of these disturbances was significantly faster than the velocity of sound in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Acoustics"}
