They discover that certain proportions of these metals result in a single stable alloy, while other proportions lead to the separation into two different ternary mixtures. The study provides insights into the behavior of these alloys and their potential applications in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
