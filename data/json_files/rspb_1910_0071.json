The enzyme appears to be pepsin-like and does not produce other proteolytic enzymes such as erepsin or trypsin. The plant absorbs the peptones from its digestive fluids, which indicates that it plays a role in the plant's nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
