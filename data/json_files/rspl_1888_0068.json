The authors find that the percentage of salts in saliva is influenced by the rate of secretion, and that different conditions affect the secretion of water, salts, and organic substances in saliva.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
