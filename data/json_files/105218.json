He finds that stone-lime, as opposed to chalk-lime, can preserve water from putrefaction and can keep fish sweet for an extended period. The antiseptic properties of lime-water are discussed, and the author suggests that fish may not be as corruptible as previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Food & Water Chemistry"}
