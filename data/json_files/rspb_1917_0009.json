The results show that bacterised peat increases the activity of nitrogen-fixing organisms in the soil, suggesting that it has properties beyond the effects of soluble humates or physical improvements in aeration.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Soil Science & Microbial Ecology"}
