Cassini's observations on two planets orbiting Saturn reveal their periods of visibility and invisibility. The larger moon takes 80 days to orbit Saturn and is visible during its western digression and invisible during its eastern digression. The smaller moon orbits in 4 days and 12 hours and is visible during its greatest digressions. The apparent size of these moons is small, and their discovery was made using a telescope of 17 feet.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Planetary Science & Moons"}
