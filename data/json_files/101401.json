Campani claims to have found a way to create large lenses without the need for molds, resulting in telescopes that are equally effective for observing objects on Earth and in the sky. He also notes the absence of rainbow colors in his lenses, which often hinder observations. The article mentions Campani's observations of Saturn's rings, Jupiter's protuberances, and the shadows of its satellites, which support the theories of Christian Huygens and Copernicus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
