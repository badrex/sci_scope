The author and his students conducted experiments using a nickel bar under various levels of stress and magnetizing forces, resulting in curves that show the relationship between the intensity of magnetization, residual magnetism, and magnetic permeability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
