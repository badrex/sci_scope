They observe four distinct periods: resting, secretory, absorptive, and recovery. The gland-cells undergo structural changes, such as the movement of protoplasm and the formation of crystals, during these periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
