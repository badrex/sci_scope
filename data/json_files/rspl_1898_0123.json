They find that the pigment is a chlorophyll derivative, primarily taken up from the intestine and deposited in the gastric gland. The author also discusses the excretion process and the role of leucocytes in transporting substances within the gland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
