The two substances share similarities in their formulae, color, and fluorescence, but also exhibit differences in solubility, crystal formation, and absorption spectra. The authors suggest a possible relationship between the two compounds and explore the potential for converting one into the other or obtaining a common derivative.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
