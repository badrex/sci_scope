The study aims to determine the time elapsed since the lowest layer of Nile sediment was deposited. The research involved sinking shafts and borings in the vicinity of ancient monuments and analyzing the various soils penetrated. The author concludes that the alluvium consists of two main types, and the Nile sediment found at the lowest depth is similar in composition to that of the present day.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geochronology"}
