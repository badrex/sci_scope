He explains that when a coil of platinum wire is connected to an electric battery and immersed in hydrogen, which is a conductor of electricity, the electric matter is abstracted or conducted from every portion of the wire, preventing the commotion that causes ignition and resulting in a cooler wire.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Energy Storage"}
