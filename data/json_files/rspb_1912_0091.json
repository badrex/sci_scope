They find that the aortic sectional area is proportional to the blood volume and that the ratio of the sectional area to body weight decreases as the animal's weight increases. The study provides a formula for expressing this relationship and suggests that the aortic size is related to the body's circulatory needs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Anatomy"}
