The study compares historical observations made by other astronomers, such as Dr. Halley, Mr. Cassini, and Mr. Flamsteed, with the author's own observations, and discusses the implications of the star's movement on the understanding of celestial mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
