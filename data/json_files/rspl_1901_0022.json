They develop a general formula for any case and provide illustrations of the conditions using tetrahedra and congruence-surfaces. The paper also discusses the approximation towards the syllogism as conditions of the 'universal' type are approached.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mathematical Logic & Statistics"}
