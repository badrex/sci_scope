Barlow investigates the power consumed in overcoming the inertia of railway trains and the resistance of the air to their motion at high velocities. He compares the theoretical velocities of trains with those observed in experiments and concludes that the resistance to railway trains increases in a ratio not much higher than the velocity, making the practical limit to the speed of railway traveling a question of safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Transportation & Railways"}
