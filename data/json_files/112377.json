The expulsion of hydrogen from the palladium causes a permanent contraction of the metal. The density of hydrogen in the alloy appears to be nearly constant, regardless of the proportion of hydrogen in the alloy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
