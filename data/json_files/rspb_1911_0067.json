The results show that the contralateral afferent nerves predominantly cause inhibition, which is stronger with stronger intercurrent stimuli. The study also demonstrates that the effect of the intercurrent stimulation can change from inhibition to excitation depending on the intensity of the background contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
