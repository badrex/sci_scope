This duplex crystallization occurs in large masses of wrought iron when slowly cooled from a white heat, and the author suggests that this phenomenon may be due to the slow cooling process allowing the formation of smaller crystals within the primary ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
