He observes that these animalcules are produced in proportion to the degree of putrefaction in the substances and suggests that further study of these microscopical observations could be useful in investigating the septic and antiseptic qualities of substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microscopy"}
