The study shows that oxygen's influence is mainly due to its ability to hold back water, which acts as a catalyst in the combustion process. The presence of excess hydrogen promotes combustion by reducing the amount of active oxygen, while excess oxygen holds back water, slowing down the combustion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
