Norman Collie, attempt to map the spectrum of radium emanation. They successfully observe a brilliant spectrum with distinct green lines, which they compare to the spectra of the argon group. The study also includes the conversion of emanation to helium, and the authors discuss the challenges they faced in obtaining a clear spectrum due to impurities and the transience of the emanation's spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
