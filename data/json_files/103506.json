He explores various methods for determining when roots are imaginary and provides a general rule for finding limits greater than any roots of an equation. Additionally, he discusses theorems in series, fluxions, and equation resolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
