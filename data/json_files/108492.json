The study suggests that the vis viva, or the sum of the vibrating molecules' velocities squared, remains constant during the transmission of solar rays through the ether. The author also explores the effects of refracted rays on the refractive index and the potential role of harmonic resonance in the Stokesian phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
