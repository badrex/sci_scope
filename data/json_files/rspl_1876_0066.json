The study finds that the temporary increase in resistance is directly proportional to the stretching force and that the increase is greater in iron and brass wires compared to steel wires when stretched the same amount.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Fields"}
