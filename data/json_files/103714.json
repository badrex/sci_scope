He discusses the limitations of previous methods, such as trigonometry, and highlights the advantages of the barometrical method, which is based on the pressure and gravity of the air. The author also provides an overview of the development of barometric tables and their applications in determining the heights of places.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geography & Geophysics"}
