The study finds no strong evidence for a short-term cycle of five to thirteen years in annual rainfall amounts, suggesting that other factors, such as abnormal falls, may have a significant impact on rainfall patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
