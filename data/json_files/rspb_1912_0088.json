The researchers found that cholesterol is never excreted as such in the feces but always in the form of coprosterol. The amount of coprosterol excreted varies depending on the type of diet consumed, with higher amounts found in carnivorous diets and lower amounts in herbivorous diets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nutrition & Metabolism"}
