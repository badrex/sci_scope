The results show that non-medullated nerves have a more rapid decrease in negative variation compared to medullated nerves, and the subsequent responses are greater for a time after rest but soon fall off.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
