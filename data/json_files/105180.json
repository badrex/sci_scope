He calculates the horizontal parallax of Mars at the time of opposition and concludes that it is approximately 27 minutes and 20 seconds. He also discusses the upcoming transit of Mercury in May and his calculations for the ingress and emersion times.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
