The research explores their anatomy, development, and the environmental factors that induce their formation, concluding that intumescences are pathological structures resulting from disturbances in the metabolic activity of the plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Sciences & Botany"}
