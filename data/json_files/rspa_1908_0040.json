They derive an exact relation between vapor pressures and osmotic pressure, providing a formula for osmotic pressure in these cases. The study also examines the connection between shrinkage and the specific volume of the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
