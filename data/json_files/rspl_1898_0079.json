The study reveals that nuclei produced by these agents require similar degrees of supersaturation for water to condense on them, and that they behave differently in an electric field, suggesting that they are either charged particles or uncharged nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
