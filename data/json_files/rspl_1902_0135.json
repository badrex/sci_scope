They develop a method for calculating the direction-cosines of refracted rays and apply it to a specific case of a plano-convex lens annulus. The study reveals the primary and secondary focal lines and the behavior of the pencil in different sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
