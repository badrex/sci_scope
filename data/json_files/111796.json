{"article_id": "111796", "revised_title": "On the Existence of an Element of Strength in Beams Subjected to Transverse Strain", "topics": ["Beam Theory", "Mechanics of Materials", "Structural Engineering", "Cast Iron", "Flexure"], "tldr": "The author, Peter William Barlow, investigates the strength of beams subjected to transverse strain and discovers an additional element of resistance, named 'Resistance to Flexure,' which acts alongside tension and compression. This element is dependent on the depth of metal in connection with the beam's deflection. Barlow provides experimental evidence and detailed measurements to support his findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
