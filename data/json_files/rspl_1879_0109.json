The author conducts a series of experiments to determine how these factors are affected by the weight employed and lifted, ultimately finding that the time of lift corresponding to the maximum work done varies with the weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Biomechanics"}
