They find that removing detritus increases phagocytosis and that the presence of detritus reduces the opsonic index. The study suggests that detritus functions as a receptor, affecting the interaction between bacteria and the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
