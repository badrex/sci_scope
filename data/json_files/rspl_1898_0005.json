They conclude that these two phenomena are directly connected, independently of any other general dispersion theory, suggesting that the Faraday effect can be explained by the difference in the frequency of vibration of circularly polarized waves in a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
