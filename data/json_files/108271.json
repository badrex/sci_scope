Benzoline forms salts that are mostly sparingly soluble, with the exception of the acetate. The substance exhibits unique properties, such as its ability to repel particles when rubbed and its transparent glassy state upon cooling.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
