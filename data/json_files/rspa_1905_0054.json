They observe that the glow of radium in hydrogen becomes fainter over time, and the spectrum shows only the nitrogen spectrum. The authors discuss the possibility of occluded or combined nitrogen or the presence of minute traces of air causing the observed spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Chemical Analysis"}
