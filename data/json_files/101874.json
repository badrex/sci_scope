The new design uses two columns of different liquids, separated by a cane, to expand the range of the barometer's divisions. This invention offers a more accurate way to detect subtle changes in atmospheric pressure, which could be useful in meteorology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
