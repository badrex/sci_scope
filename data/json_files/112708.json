The study reveals that atropine has no effect on blood-vessels, while digitaline and aconitine have contrasting actions on the heart, with digitaline causing violent contractions and aconitine leading to a perversion of rhythm and heart failure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pharmacology"}
