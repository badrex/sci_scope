The process involves the splitting of the rock into hexagonal prisms, with the diameter of each prism determined by the relation between the coefficient of contraction and extension at the splitting temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Igneous Rocks"}
