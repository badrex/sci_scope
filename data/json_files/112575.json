The nucleus is self-luminous and consists of ignited gas, while the coma reflects sunlight. The continuous spectrum of the coma's light suggests that it is composed of fog or cloud-like matter. The bright line in the spectrum corresponds to the bright line of nitrogen, indicating that cometary matter may consist of nitrogen or a more elementary substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Cometary Science"}
