Marshall Ward, discovers that the tubercular swellings on the roots of Leguminosae plants are caused by a parasitic fungus. He successfully infects healthy roots, identifies the infecting agent, and observes its growth inside the tubercles. The fungus's role in inducing root hypertrophy and its potential impact on agriculture is discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
