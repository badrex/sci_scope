The diatoms are found in large numbers and are also present on sea ice in the region. The author suggests that the whales may acquire this coating of diatoms from their food sources in the icy waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Ecology"}
