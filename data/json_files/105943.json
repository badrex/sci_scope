The method differs from previous approaches, such as those used by Dr. Stewart, and offers a more accurate determination of the Sun's distance. The author also discusses potential sources of error in the calculations and suggests that further refinements may be necessary to account for planetary disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
