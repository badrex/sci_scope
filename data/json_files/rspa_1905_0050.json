They use a balance with a brass cylinder and a counterpoise, subjecting the weight to various temperature changes while keeping the counterpoise at a constant temperature. The results show that there is no significant change in weight with changes in temperature, suggesting that temperature does not have a significant effect on weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Experimental Physics & Thermodynamics"}
