He suspends two bottles, one filled with water and the other with weak spirit of wine, on a balance and exposes them to varying temperatures. He finds that the water in the bottle acquires additional weight when frozen, while the spirit of wine does not freeze. This experiment challenges the prevailing belief that heat has a weight associated with it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Calorimetry"}
