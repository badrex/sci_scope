{"article_id": "111696", "revised_title": "Investigating the Sources of Nitrogen in Vegetation and the Assimilation of Free Nitrogen", "topics": ["Nitrogen Assimilation", "Plant Nutrition", "Soil Fertility", "Crop Rotation", "Agricultural Manures"], "tldr": "The authors investigate the sources of nitrogen in vegetation and the question of whether plants assimilate free or uncombined nitrogen. They discuss the effects of crop rotation, manures, and soil composition on nitrogen yields and explore various potential sources of nitrogen for plants, including atmospheric nitrogen. The authors present experimental evidence and review previous research to determine the role of free nitrogen in plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
