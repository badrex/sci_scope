The composition and weight of its molecule is represented by the formula C12H14N2Br2. The reaction also produces dichloride and a platinum salt, with the hydrates of the diatomic pyridine-derivatives being less stable than Professor Hofmann's ethylated bases in the nitrogen and phosphorus series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Compounds"}
