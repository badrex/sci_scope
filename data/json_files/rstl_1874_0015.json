The author discusses previous research on the subject and presents experiments conducted using a vacuum balance to measure the force of attraction and repulsion in various conditions. The results suggest that there may be a connection between heat and gravitational force, and that the repulsive force caused by heat is not solely due to the lengthening of the beam or the influence of residual gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
