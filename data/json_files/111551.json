Tait, explore the properties of ozone, its formation, and its interactions with various substances. They find that the commonly held belief that all oxygen in a sealed tube can be converted into ozone through electrical sparks is incorrect. They also discover that ozone has a higher density than oxygen and discuss its reactions with different substances, such as mercury, silver, and various metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
