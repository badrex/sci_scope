They also determine the specific heat at constant pressure and the cooling effect of the steam, finding that the specific heat is nearly independent of pressure and the cooling effect is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
