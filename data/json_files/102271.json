This method does not require consideration of the Sun's parallax, refractions of the air, or the greatest obliquity of the ecliptic, and can be performed using simple instruments such as a gnomon or a high building.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrological Observations & Calculations"}
