The method involves using a brass arc, a micrometer microscope, and a series of comparisons to determine the accuracy of the instrument. The author estimates that the time required for this examination is about ninety-eight hours, but the confidence gained from the precise measurements is considered well worth the effort.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Instrumentation & Observational Techniques"}
