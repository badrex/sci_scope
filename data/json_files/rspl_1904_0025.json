The study focuses on the behavior of amphoteric substances like glycine and amino-acids in solution, and the author derives equations to express the concentrations of various ions present in the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
