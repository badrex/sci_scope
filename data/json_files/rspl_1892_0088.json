Dixon investigates the rate of explosion in various gaseous mixtures, confirming Berthelot's measurements and exploring the effects of temperature, pressure, and the presence of inert gases on the explosion rate. Dixon also discusses the potential mechanisms behind the propagation of explosion waves and the role of steam in the oxidation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
