The study reveals that the colors produced by the crystals are not due to absorption and that the reflected light is not polarized. The spectrum of the reflected light is also found to be unique, with narrow bands of total or near-total reflection that shift towards increasing refrangibility as the angle of incidence increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry"}
