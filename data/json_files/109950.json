He found that winter-felled alburnum has a lower specific gravity and gains less weight when exposed to damp conditions compared to spring-felled alburnum. Knight suggests that by removing bark in spring and felling the tree in winter, the timber's quality could be improved.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Forestry & Tree Biology"}
