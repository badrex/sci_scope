They find that benzene, a component of coal gas, is highly toxic and responsible for the poisonous effects on muscles and frogs. The study explains the differences observed between the action of coal gas and carbon monoxide, which were previously attributed to other factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Toxicology"}
