Using various animal preparations, he observes the structure and arrangement of nerve fibers and concludes that most fibers from the spinal nerves proceed directly to the grey substance of the chord. He also suggests that the communication between the sensorium and spinal nerves is established through the antero-lateral columns, and discusses the role of loops in nerve fiber termination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
