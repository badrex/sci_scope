The study concludes that the starch granule is composed of two parts, chemically and histologically distinct, and that the conversion of starch into glucose is not solely due to saliva or gastric juice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nutrition & Digestive Physiology"}
