The larvae undergo a series of changes, including the transformation of ciliated cells into granular cells, and the formation of a lens-like body that may be a primitive light-perceiving organ. The metamorphosis is completed in a few hours after the larvae fix themselves to the bottom of the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Development"}
