N. Hartley, responds to Dr. Humpidge's critique of his previous work on the atomic weight of beryllium. Hartley argues that the spectroscopic evidence he presented supports the idea that beryllium is a dyad metal, and that its spectrum is more closely related to lithium than other alkaline earth metals. He also discusses the periodic law and how it relates to the chemical properties of compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
