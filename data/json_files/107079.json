The substance is found to be transparent, phosphorescent, and resistant to fracture, with various crystal forms and angles. The author also discusses its occurrence in natural specimens and its potential confusion with common carbonate of lime.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mineralogy & Crystallography"}
