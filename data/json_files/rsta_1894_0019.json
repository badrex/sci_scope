The study reveals similarities in the number and intensities of lines, suggesting that the temperature of iron vapor in the sun is similar to that of the electric arc. The presence of various elements in the meteorites is also discussed, with calcium being more prevalent in the Nejed meteorite and nickel, barium, and strontium in the Obernkirchen meteorite.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteoritics & Planetary Science"}
