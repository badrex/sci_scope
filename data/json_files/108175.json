Ivory, corrects an error in a previous paper from 1838, discussing the limits of quantities p and r2 in the context of differential equations. He acknowledges M. Liousville's contribution to the correction and provides a new analysis of the problem, resulting in a determination of the limits sought.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Calculus"}
