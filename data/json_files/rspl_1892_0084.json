The research demonstrates that mechanical, electrical, and thermal stimulation can excite variations in the skin's electromotive force, supporting the hypothesis that both the resting and action currents originate from glandular sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
