He develops a mathematical formula to calculate the deflection of the plumb-line and determines that the mass of the Doubtful Region is greater than that of the Known Region. The findings have implications for understanding the Earth's gravitational field and the behavior of the plumb-line in various locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
