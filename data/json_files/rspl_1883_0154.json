They find that the vapour-pressure of a solid is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and that these differences can be calculated from thermic data. The author also introduces a new method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
