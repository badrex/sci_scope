The author finds that the expansion of wood cut in the direction of the grain is greatly affected by the tension to which it is exposed, as well as its humidity. The elasticity of the wood is also found to be diminished by an increase in temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
