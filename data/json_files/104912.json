Simpson, discusses the advantage of taking the mean of multiple observations in practical astronomy to reduce errors and improve accuracy. He presents a mathematical model to determine the probability of the error exceeding a given value and demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomical Observation & Techniques"}
