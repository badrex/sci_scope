They find that magnesium vapour absorbs light at specific wavelengths, specifically at 2852.22 \u00c5 and 2026.46 \u00c5, and discuss the implications of these findings on the understanding of magnesium's atomic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
