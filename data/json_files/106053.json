The method involves eliminating composite numbers from an arithmetic series, leaving only prime numbers. This ancient technique is still useful for finding primes and remains a significant contribution to the field of number theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Number Theory & Combinatorics"}
