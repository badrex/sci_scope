The author conducts a series of experiments on animals and concludes that the medulla oblongata plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. The experiments also suggest that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Endocrinology & Diabetes"}
