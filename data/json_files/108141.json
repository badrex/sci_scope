The study covers observations made between England and the Cape of Good Hope, using two deflectors and constant weights.", "topics": ["Magnetism", "Terrestrial Magnetism", "Deflectors", "Coercing Weights", "Magnetic Intensity"], "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
