They find that the antiserum, rather than the homologous protein, is the main source of precipitable substance, and that the serum of a rabbit immunized with egg-white or blood serum has the capacity to be precipitated by the homologous protein.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
