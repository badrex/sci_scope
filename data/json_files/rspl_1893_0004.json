The study reveals similarities in the origin and structure of these structures, supporting the idea that both families share a common ancestry and that their spore-producing organs have evolved from a simple Lycopodinous type.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
