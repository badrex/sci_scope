The results show that while some drugs have a significant impact on conductivity, others, such as atropine, have no observable effect. The research also highlights the distinction between emotive changes caused by drugs and those resulting from other factors like pain or fear of injections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurophysiology & Neuropsychology"}
