They used sensitive paper coated with silver chloride to estimate the tint acquired upon exposure to daylight. The results showed that the rate of diminution of chemical action during the eclipse was greater than the area of the darkened solar disk, and less so during the exposed portion of the disk.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Photochemistry & Spectroscopy"}
