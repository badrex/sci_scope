They explore the effects of rotation on the distribution of gas in a nebula, finding that rotation can alter the density and shape of the nebula, with implications for understanding astronomical phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Cosmology"}
