Pemberton, investigates the historical problem of the locus for three and four lines, exploring its connection to conic sections and providing a detailed analysis of the problem's solution. The study delves into the work of Apollonius and Sir Isaac Newton, offering insights into the geometric problem-solving techniques of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Algebra"}
