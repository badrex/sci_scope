He explores the role of hydrogen and water in the process and suggests that water is decomposed during voltaic action, with oxygen and hydrogen moving in opposite directions. This understanding can help improve large-scale electro-metallurgic operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes"}
