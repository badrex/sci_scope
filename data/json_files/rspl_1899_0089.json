The study suggests that at least three substances are responsible for the coronal rings, and the green line of the coronal spectrum appears to be produced in the inner corona rather than the outer corona.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Solar Spectroscopy"}
