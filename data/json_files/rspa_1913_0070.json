The spectrum is distinct from that of carbon disulphide and is not given by the discharge through pure sulphur vapour. The new bands are only developed when the carbon line 2478 is present, suggesting a connection between carbon and the formation of the bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
