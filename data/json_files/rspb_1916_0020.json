They find that unheated serum enhances the digestion process, suggesting the presence of a \"protryptic\" property in the serum that prepares organisms for digestion by leucocytic digestive fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
