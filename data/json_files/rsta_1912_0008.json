The authors analyze the cooling curves of various alloys and discuss the effects of different rates of cooling on the alloys' properties. They also examine the impact of impurities and the importance of complete equilibrium in understanding the alloys' behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Alloy Development"}
