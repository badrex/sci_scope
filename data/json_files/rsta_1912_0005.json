They develop a novel mercury resistance thermometer and discuss the challenges and improvements made in their experimental setup. The results contribute to the understanding of water's specific heat and the mechanical equivalent of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Calorimetry"}
