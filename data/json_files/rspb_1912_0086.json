The trypanosome appears to be more similar to T. evansi than T. brucei based on morphology and disease progression in experimental animals. The author also discusses the limitations and usefulness of the biometric method in diagnosing trypanosomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Pathology"}
