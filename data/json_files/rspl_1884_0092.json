The research demonstrates that temperature divergence between metals plays a significant role in reversing the electromotive force, and explores the relationship between thermal effects and the normal electrochemical action of fused salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Thermodynamics"}
