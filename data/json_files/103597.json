He finds no evidence of a membranous pellicle in the eyes, and instead discovers that the cataracts were caused by a preternatural opacity in the crystalline humor. He also discusses the limitations of the needle technique used in cataract surgery.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ophthalmology & Optometry"}
