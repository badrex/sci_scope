They find that the refractivities of these elements conform to the rule that in each chemical group, the refractivities of elements are in the ratios of small integers. The authors also observe a relationship between refractivity and valency, with the power to retard light increasing as valency increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
