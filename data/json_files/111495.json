The cooling effect is caused by the absorption of heat at higher temperatures and the evolution of heat at lower temperatures, with the total energy of the matter increasing by a degree Centigrade when the film is drawn out to 16 square inches.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
