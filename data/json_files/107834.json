The experiments were conducted in the East India Import Dock, and the results provide a more accurate measure of resistance, accounting for factors such as friction and the internal motion of the fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Oceanography"}
