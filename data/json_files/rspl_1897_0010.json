They find that the deposits at Hitchin support the conclusions drawn from previous research at Hoxne, providing evidence for the climatic conditions during the ancient alluvial strata deposition. However, the results are somewhat disappointing due to the difficulty in obtaining clear evidence from the gravels and the absence of certain records found at Hoxne.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Paleontology"}
