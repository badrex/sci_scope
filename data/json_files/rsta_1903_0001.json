The study assumes normal distribution of complex groups of organs and selection surfaces, providing a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of selection on biological populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary Biology & Genetics"}
