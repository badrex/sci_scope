It describes the development of egg-membranes in both groups and discusses the differences in segmentation processes. The author also compares their findings to those of placental mammals, providing insights into the development and evolution of vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
