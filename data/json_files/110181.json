He argues that the formation of sulphovinic acid is a necessary and intermediate step in the production of ether from alcohol and sulfuric acid. This theory is also illustrated by using olefiant gas as the hydrocarbonous base.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
