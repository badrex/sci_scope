Picrorocellin is found to be the first crystalline organic substance containing nitrogen in lichens, while xanthorocellin is formed by the action of dilute acids on picrorocellin. Both compounds have distinct properties and structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
