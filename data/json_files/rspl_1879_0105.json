By heating a gas containing carbon and hydrogen in the presence of certain metals and nitrogen compounds, the carbon can be deposited in the crystalline state as a clear, transparent diamond. The author also provides details on the specific gravity and composition of the synthesized diamond.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Crystallography"}
