They propose that the force equivalent to the rate of flow of momentum across a plane perpendicular to a beam of light acts upon the matter bounded by the plane. The potential energy in these waves is negligible in comparison to the kinetic energy, and the fraction of the energy of the beam located in these waves is proportional to the intensity of the beam.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Wave Phenomena"}
