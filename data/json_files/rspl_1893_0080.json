The experiments reveal that heliotropic effects of flashing light are significantly greater than those produced by constant light sources, with no chlorophyll formation observed in the etiolated seedlings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
