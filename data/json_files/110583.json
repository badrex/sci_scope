This method, previously suggested by Pingre and Lemmonier, overcomes the difficulty of accurately determining the moon's declination by calculating altitudes for two meridians. The only requirement is an accurate determination of the latitude, which is not a significant challenge on land or at sea. Examples demonstrate the practical application of this method.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics"}
