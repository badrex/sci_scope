The experiments aimed to determine the compression of the Earth and were conducted by Sir Thomas Brisbane, Captain Henry Kater, and Mr. Rumker. The findings were compared to those of Mr. Dunlop, revealing slight differences in the compression values.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
