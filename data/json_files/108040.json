Forbes conducted an experiment to determine the origin of the deficient rays in the solar spectrum. He observed that the spectrum did not change during the eclipse, suggesting that the sun's atmosphere does not cause the deficiency. This experiment provides evidence that the solar light may be primitively incomplete.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Spectroscopy"}
