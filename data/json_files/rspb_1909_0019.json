The study also shows that the correlations are close to those determined for somatic characters in biometric investigations, suggesting a more intimate relationship between gametic and somatic constitutions than just absolute dominance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Heredity"}
