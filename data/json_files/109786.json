The scale is based on Richter's observations of acid-to-acid proportions and is constructed similarly to a sliding rule, allowing for quick calculations and analysis of saline compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
