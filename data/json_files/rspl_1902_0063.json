The results show that a six-month exposure to -190\u00b0C has no appreciable effect on the vitality of micro-organisms, and mechanical trituration at the temperature of liquid air abolishes the luminosity of photogenic bacteria, suggesting that bioluminescence is a function of the living cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Immunology"}
