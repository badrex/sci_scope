Using Kirchhoff's 4-prism spectroscope and a graphical method, they compared the wave-lengths of the absorption bands and found that the spectra are not identical, even when examined at different temperatures or varying gas column lengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
