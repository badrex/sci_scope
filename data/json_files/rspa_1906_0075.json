The spectra cover a range from 3300 to 5875, with nearly all the brighter lines identified with high certainty. The study compares the solar spectrum with spark and arc spectra, but does not attempt to explain the differences and resemblances physically.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics"}
