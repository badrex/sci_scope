The child's stomach and intestines are examined, revealing a preternaturally thick peritoneum and a cartilaginous pylorus. The child's lungs are also studied, with the right lobe being thin and compact, while the left lobe is more florid and spongy. The author discusses the child's symptoms, including vomiting and a stoppage of urine and stool, and considers the role of the omentum in the child's illness.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pediatrics & Child Health"}
