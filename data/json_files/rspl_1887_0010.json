They propose a hypothesis that the cause of these anomalies lies in the interchange between lower and higher atmospheric strata, driven by convection currents resulting from diurnal heating of the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
