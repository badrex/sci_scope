The case study challenges the notion that the menses in women are derived from a uterine ferment, as the man's discharge is similar to the menses but occurs in a different part of the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Medical Case Studies & Histories"}
