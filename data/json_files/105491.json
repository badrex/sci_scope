He observes that the air produced is not affected by water or alcalies and can ignite when mixed with common air. He also discusses the phlogiston theory in relation to these experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
