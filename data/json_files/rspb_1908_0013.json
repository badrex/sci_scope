The results show that the motor centers are similar to those found in higher primates, with distinct areas controlling the lower limb, upper limb, and head regions. The study also highlights the large size of the hand and finger area, which is consistent with the lemur's arboreal lifestyle and the use of its hands in climbing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
