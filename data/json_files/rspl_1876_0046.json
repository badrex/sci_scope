They measure the resulting electrical charge using a quadrant electrometer and a Thomson galvanometer, finding that the contact of dissimilar metals produces a small but measurable amount of electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
