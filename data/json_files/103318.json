Halley observes a small telescopic comet near Mars and documents its position, size, and behavior. The comet is initially mistaken for a nebula due to its small size and slow motion, but further observation confirms it as a comet. This discovery highlights the rarity of comet sightings and the importance of continued astronomical observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Comets"}
