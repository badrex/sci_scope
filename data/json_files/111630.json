Matthiessen investigates the electric conducting power of over 200 alloys and categorizes them into two classes based on their conductivity. He also identifies three groups of alloys and discusses their properties, concluding that some alloys are solutions, chemical combinations, or mechanical mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
