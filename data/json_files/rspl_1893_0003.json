They develop a calorimeter and a pressure regulator to control variables and obtain accurate results, ultimately confirming Newton's law of cooling and establishing a connection between the mechanical equivalent of heat and electrical units.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
