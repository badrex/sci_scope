He finds that a rise in atmospheric pressure corresponds to a decrease in the mean level of the sea, and vice versa. Ross also develops a formula to determine the correct height of the tide or mean sea level based on these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Meteorology"}
