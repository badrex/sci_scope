The study uses three materials, glass, brass, and steel, and measures their resistance to linear extension, shearing, and cubical compression. The results show significant differences in rigidity among the materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
