The experiments reveal that a fluid's refractive index does not solely depend on its specific gravity, suggesting that other factors, such as inflammability or the texture of its components, play a role in the refraction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
