{"article_id": "rspa_1918_0010", "revised_title": "The Rankine Trochoidal Wave: A Review and Extension", "topics": ["Wave Theory", "Hydrodynamics", "Fluid Mechanics", "Optimization", "Shear Flow"], "tldr": "The author examines the Rankine trochoidal wave, a geometric representation of water waves, and explores its properties and applications. The article discusses the wave's behavior in various conditions, such as when walls are introduced into the water, and how the wave motion can be extended and optimized for different scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Fluid Dynamics"}
