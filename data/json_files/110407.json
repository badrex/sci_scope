Johnson investigates the reciprocal influence of magnetic needles at different positions on Earth. He conducts experiments at Yarmouth, London, and Clifton, and presents the results in tabular form. Johnson believes that comparing observations of deflections can help determine local influences and provide corrections for magnetic observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
