He uses a setup with two barometers connected to a system that releases compressed air, causing the mercury to descend. The experiment shows that high winds can lessen the pressure of the atmosphere, and the mercury in the barometers subsides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
