The coin's features, such as the dolphin and acrostolium symbols, suggest it was produced in a maritime town, and the author argues that the city of Paestum in Lucania is the most likely place of origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences & Humanities", "scientific_subdiscipline": "History & Archaeology"}
