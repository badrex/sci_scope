The detector is based on the decrease of magnetic hysteresis in iron when exposed to high-frequency or Hertzian waves. This detector is more sensitive and reliable than a coherer and can be used in long-distance space telegraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Wireless Communication"}
