The boulders contain minerals such as garnets and olivine, and the diamonds are found to be associated with pyrope, suggesting that the diamonds were formed in situ within the deep-seated holocrystalline mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Mineralogy"}
