Pingre, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, shares his observations of the 1769 transit of Venus with the Royal Society of London. He discusses the methods used to determine the latitude and longitude of his observatory in Martinique and St. Domingo, as well as the observations made by various astronomers. The observations were used to calculate the Sun's parallax, which is crucial for determining the scale of the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
