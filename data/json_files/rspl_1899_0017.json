They describe the egg, gastrulation, and early larval stages, as well as the transition to the adult form. The research also discusses the evolutionary significance of external gills in vertebrates and their potential role in the origin of the vertebrate limb.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Evolutionary Biology"}
