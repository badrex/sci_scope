The yellow pigment found in most Pierid genera is a derivative of uric acid, and the white pigment in the white Pieridos contains uric acid as well. The pigments are used for ornamentation and are excreted by the butterflies as a normal byproduct.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Biology"}
