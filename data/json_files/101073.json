He finds that ice formed without air is opaque and whitish, similar to hail, while ice formed in the air is transparent like crystal. Additionally, he observes that ice formed without air is denser than ice formed in the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Climatology & Meteorology"}
