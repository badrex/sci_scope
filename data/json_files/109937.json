He discovers its unique ability to become transparent when immersed in water and opake with a small amount of water. Brewster also measures its low refractive power, which is lower than any other solid or liquid, and provides a formula for computing the absolute refractive power of bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Crystallography"}
