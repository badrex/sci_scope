The study reveals that the lens has a complex structure with different parts acting on light differently, and that the human crystalline lens will likely display similar properties but in a lesser degree.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
