They also find that fibrin contains lecithin, and that the difference in behavior between fibrinogen and fibrin towards artificial gastric juice suggests a different relationship between lecithin and proteid in the two substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
