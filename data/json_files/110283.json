He discovers that every substance susceptible of magnetism by induction tends to arrest the action of a magnet when interposed as a screen, and that the screening power depends on the mass of the interposed substance. He also explores the neutralizing power of iron masses and suggests that a temporary magnetic state may be induced in a substance through the immediate action of the magnet or through the action of each particle of the substance on the next in succession.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
