He discovers that inflammable air, when heated, can convert calx of lead into metallic lead, suggesting that phlogiston is the same as inflammable air. This finding challenges the prevailing phlogiston theory and contributes to the development of the caloric theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
