The paper focuses on the properties and applications of these integrals, including the connection between multiple integrals and repeated integrals, and the use of these concepts in mathematical analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Calculus"}
