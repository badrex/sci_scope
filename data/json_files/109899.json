Knight, investigates the role of heartwood in trees and concludes that it serves as a winter reservoir for organizable matter, which is essential for the tree's growth and survival. He also refutes the idea that sap ascends through the heartwood and suggests that it moves through the bark and convergent cellular processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
