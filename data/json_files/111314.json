The study demonstrates a correspondence between the variations of force in upward air currents and variations in atmospheric humidity, suggesting that these variations are largely due to changing hygrometric conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
