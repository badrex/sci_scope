These organs consist of an air sac and branching tubes that open into the pericardial space, suggesting a respiratory function. This finding challenges existing accounts of respiration in myriapods and has implications for understanding their morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organismal Biology & Anatomy"}
