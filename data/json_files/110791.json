Wharton Jones, critiques Dr. Martin Barry's papers on blood corpuscles, pointing out errors in his observations and conclusions. Jones argues that Dr. Barry has confused the colorless corpuscles with the red corpuscles and misidentified fibers within the red corpuscles. He also disputes the existence of fibers in the interior of blood corpuscles and their role in the formation of fibrin. Jones believes that the beaded aspect of the red corpuscles and the flask-like vesicles are due to mechanical or chemical effects and decomposition, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
