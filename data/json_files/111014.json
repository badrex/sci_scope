The experiments reveal that the heat generated is less in hydrogen and its compounds than in other gases, and that the cooling effect of hydrogen nearly equals that of water. The cooling effects are not due to specific gravity, specific heat, or conducting power of the gases for electricity, but may be related to molecular characters of the gases and their surface properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
