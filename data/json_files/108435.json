Whewell, presents a comprehensive analysis of tide observations at various locations along the British coasts, discussing the height of high water and the variations between spring and neap tides. The study also explores the correlation between the equilibrium theory and the observed data, providing a construction to represent the curve of the tide heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrology"}
