The authors discuss the results in the light of the \"hydroxylation\" theory of hydrocarbon combustion and provide an experimental determination of the relative affinities of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide for oxygen in flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
