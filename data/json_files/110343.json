These hearts are found in frogs, toads, salamanders, and green lizards, and play a role in propelling lymph in the lymphatic vessels, similar to the heart's function in the blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
