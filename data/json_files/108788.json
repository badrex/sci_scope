The specimen includes bones from the furculum, pelvis, and tail, as well as impressions of feathers and down. The author discusses the similarities and differences between the creature's wings and tail and those of modern birds and other animals, suggesting that it may represent a transitional form in the evolution of birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolution"}
