V. Thompson discovers the metamorphoses in the second type of cirripedes, the Lepades, completing the natural history of these animals and confirming their affinity with crustacea. His research challenges the classification of cirripedes as a distinct class of animals and suggests they occupy an intermediate position between decapoda crustacea and entomostraca crustacea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Evolutionary Biology"}
