They find that the trypanosome is common among Lake-shore antelopes and that palpalis flies are the carriers of this species. The study also reveals that Glossina palpalis caught on the Lake-shore are naturally infected with Trypanosoma uniforme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
