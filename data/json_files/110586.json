Newbold, examines the composition of the R\u00e8gar or black cotton soil of India and challenges the prevailing belief that it is formed from the disintegration of trap rocks. Instead, he proposes that it is a sedimentary deposit from waters in a state of repose, based on his observations of the soil's extensive coverage across the Indian peninsula.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Soil Science & Geology"}
