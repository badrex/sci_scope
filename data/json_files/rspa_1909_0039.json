They find that ionization in a gas is independent of temperature when the gas is kept at constant density, and that ionization in air remains unaffected even when cooled down to a temperature near its condensation point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
