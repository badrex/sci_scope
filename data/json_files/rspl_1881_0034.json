The experiments reveal that Swan's spectrum cannot be solely attributed to hydrocarbon, and the phenomenon shown by sparks is not as convincing. The author also observes a new line spectrum when the density of the gas is increased.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
