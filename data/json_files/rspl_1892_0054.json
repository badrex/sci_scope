They find that the nitrites have a paralyzing effect on the muscle and that the order of activity varies depending on the extent and speed of the induced shortening. The study also explores the connection between the nitrites' chemical constitution and their physiological actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pharmacology"}
