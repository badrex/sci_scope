They explain the color and polarization effects in regular gold ruby glass and demonstrate that these properties can be produced in a colorless metal glass using radiation from radium. The study also accounts for the changes in color and transparency in gold and silver films, as well as the color changes in potassium and sodium films upon heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Nanotechnology"}
