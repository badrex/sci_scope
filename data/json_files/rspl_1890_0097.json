They find that nitrites cause a fall in blood pressure due to the dilatation of arterioles, and discuss the possible causes of this dilatation, whether it is a direct action on the vaso-motor centers or on the walls of the vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pharmacology & Toxicology"}
