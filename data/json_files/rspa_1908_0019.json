They discover that the hydride spectrum is highly complex and always present in great intensity when hydrogen is present. The high-frequency flame discharge provides a brilliant spectrum that differs from the spark and arc spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Chemical Analysis"}
