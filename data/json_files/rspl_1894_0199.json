The study demonstrates the identity of natural and artificial pigments and discusses their probable constitution. The author also observes that these pigments are unique to the Pierid group among Rhopalocera and that different pigments are used in mimicry between different butterfly species.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
