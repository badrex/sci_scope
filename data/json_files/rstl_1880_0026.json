By increasing the resistance in the outer circuit, the machine can produce more powerful currents with less energy expenditure, leading to increased efficiency and reduced risk of overheating or damage to the machine.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Electronics"}
