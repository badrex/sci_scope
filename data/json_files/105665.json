The clock was found to be accurate within a second of time, with the accuracy affected by the dryness of the location. The author also discusses the limitations of using an equal altitude instrument for such observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Timekeeping & Clocks"}
