The study reveals that the isobaric lines can be represented by parallel straight lines, and provides insights into the annual variations of barometric pressure and wind directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
