The study reveals that the shark's reproductive process is similar to that of birds, with eggs contained in a membranous bag and young sharks remaining attached to their yolk sacs until they are capable of independent life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Ichthyology"}
