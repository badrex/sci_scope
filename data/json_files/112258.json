W. Bunsen and H. E. Roscoe, develop a method to measure the chemical action of direct and diffuse sunlight using photographic sensitized paper. They explore the factors affecting the sensitivity of the paper and the accuracy of the measurements, and present a method to compare shades of blackness produced by different intensities of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry"}
