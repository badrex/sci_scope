The authors find that temperature fluctuations and improper knife-edge alignment are the main causes of anomalous behavior. They recommend using an inner case to shield the balance beam from temperature variations and suggest a fatigue period for the balance to reach a normal state before taking measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Measurement & Instrumentation"}
