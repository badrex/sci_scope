They discover that the secretion is regulated by a chemical substance called secretin, which is produced by the mucous membrane in response to the presence of acid in the small intestine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
