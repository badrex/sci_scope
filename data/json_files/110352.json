He also examines the lifting power of electro-magnets and their relation to length, energy, and the quality of materials used. Additionally, he describes a method for obtaining a continuous current of electricity through the induction of common magnets and discusses the limitations of electro-magnetic power in chemical decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Induction"}
