They find that lutidine increases the tonicity of the heart's ventricle and has a minimal effect on the auricles. The study also shows that lutidine affects voluntary muscle, causing an increase in tonicity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Pharmacology"}
