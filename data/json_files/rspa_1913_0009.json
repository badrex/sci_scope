They introduce a second term in the differential equation for loss of intensity in a beam of radiation, accounting for attenuation by absorption without scattering. They also consider the effect of self-illumination on the intensity of sky radiation and apply their findings to problems of solar radiation attenuation and sky radiation intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
