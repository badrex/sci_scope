They observe that certain types of iron and steel exhibit a momentary elongation during cooling and a contraction during heating. The study uses advanced apparatus to analyze the phenomena and provides insights into the behavior of iron and steel under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
