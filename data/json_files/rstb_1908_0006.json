Experiments show that the periosteum alone is not responsible for bone regeneration, and other factors, such as the bone's own cells and the surrounding connective tissue, play a significant role in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
