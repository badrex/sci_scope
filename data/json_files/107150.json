The study investigates the effects of parallax and the motions of the stars, concluding that the observed changes cannot be solely attributed to the motion of the solar system or a single star's motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry"}
