The research uses synoptic charts to show temperature and salinity distribution, and over 16,000 temperature observations were collected from various sources. The main conclusions are that surface waters are drifted eastward towards Europe, and the circulation is influenced by the Atlantic anticyclone and cyclones. The study also discusses the escape of water through the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and the Irminger stream, and the impact of melted ice on the circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrography"}
