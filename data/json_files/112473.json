The author uses various methods to visualize and analyze the fibers, finding that they form a complex network of spiral fibers that create figure-of-8 loops. These loops are directed towards the stomach's greater and lesser curvatures and contribute to the formation of sphincter-like structures at the entrance and exit of the stomach. The study also discusses the layers and thickness of the stomach's muscular coat and its variations across different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
