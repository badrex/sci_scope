The authors found that swallowing, mental impressions, and food ingestion can cause intestinal contractions. The speed of transit through the fistula varies depending on the condition of the animal and the time since the last meal. The study also examines the effects of exercise, mechanical irritation, and electrical stimulation on intestinal movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
