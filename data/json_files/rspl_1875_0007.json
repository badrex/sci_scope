The results show that deep and active respiration, as well as artificial respiration, can lead to the production of glycosuria, suggesting a connection between oxygenated blood and liver function.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Pathology & Internal Medicine"}
