Baden Powell investigates the dark bands in the solar spectrum caused by partial interception by transparent plates. He explains that the phenomenon can be explained by the undulatory theory, showing that a difference in retardation between the two halves of each primary pencil throughout the spectrum can cause bands within certain limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
