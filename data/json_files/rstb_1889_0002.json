They find that the percentage of salts does not always increase with an increased rate of secretion, and discuss the factors that may influence this relationship, such as variations in the rate of secretion and the condition of the gland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
