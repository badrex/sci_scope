He concludes that the streamers have a vertical or parallel position to the magnetic dip and form a thin fringe stretching from east to west. The height of this meteor region is estimated to be around 2000 feet above the surface, with the possibility of an additional 2000 to 3000 feet elevation for the upper ends of the vertical streamers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
