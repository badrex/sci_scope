The heart's various parts, including the auricle, ventricle, and sinus, are described in detail, along with their connections and functions. The research also explores the normal and reversed order of heart contractions and the impact of these contractions on the circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Physiology"}
