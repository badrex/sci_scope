The study is based on the extension of Dr. Salmon's theory of reciprocal surfaces and provides a detailed explanation of various types of singularities and their impact on the surface's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
