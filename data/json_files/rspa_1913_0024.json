The authors argue that the solubility of a salt is influenced by the presence of other salts and non-electrolytes, and that the interaction between solute and solvent is crucial in understanding these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Equilibria"}
