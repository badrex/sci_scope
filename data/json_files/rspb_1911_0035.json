The technique involves inducing temporary colour-blindness in a small area of the field of view by alternating monochromatic flashes, allowing the observer to see the boundaries of underlying colour sensations. The author believes this method has the potential to supersede other colour-testing methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Sensory Systems"}
