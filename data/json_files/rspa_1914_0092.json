They also observe that the formation of halos or envelopes surrounding primary crystals is associated with eutectics of spherical growth, while eutectics with defined crystal contours do not exhibit this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
