The author demonstrates alternative methods to using the Second Law of Thermodynamics to solve problems in these areas and discusses the effects of external factors like pressure, capillarity, and temperature on these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
