The study reveals that teeth are functional for a significant portion of the animal's life and are shed similarly to other mammals' milk teeth. The research also confirms the presence of teeth in Ornithorhynchus, previously discovered by Mr. E. B. Poulton.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Anatomy"}
