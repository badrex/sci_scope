T. Desaguliers conducts an experiment to demonstrate how friction in a compound engine can be calculated using pullies. He determines the friction in each pulley and calculates the total friction, which is then compared to the experimentally measured value, showing a close match.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Machine Design"}
