This dissymmetry increases as the angle with the primary beam decreases. The excess of forward scattered radiation is not explained by the symmetrical scattering of the primary beam and may be due to other factors such as irregular refractions or deflections of the primary ray.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Particle Physics"}
