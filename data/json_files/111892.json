The study reveals that increased muscular irritability, whether due to paralysis or lowered temperature, results in delayed onset and prolonged duration of cadaveric rigidity and slower putrefaction. Conversely, decreased irritability leads to earlier onset and shorter duration of rigidity and faster putrefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathology"}
