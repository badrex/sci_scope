The authors find evidence of a substantial selective death-rate that may be four times greater than the non-selective death-rate, suggesting that natural selection plays a significant role in determining human lifespan.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Genetics & Evolution"}
