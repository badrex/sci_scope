The experiments show how the polarity of a needle can be altered by touching it to steel bars or artificial magnets, and how the strength of the magnet can be increased or decreased depending on the materials used.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
