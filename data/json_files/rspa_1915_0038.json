They observe that the CO2 escaping from the fermentation of a saccharine solution carries an electric charge and is ionized. The study provides insights into the relationship between fermentation and the generation of electrical effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
