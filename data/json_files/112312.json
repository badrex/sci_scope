He discovers a diurnal variation in the forces acting on the magnetometers, which follows a specific law. However, he concludes that the sun's direct and inducing action is not the sole cause of these variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
