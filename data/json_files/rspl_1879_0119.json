Reynolds addresses the phenomenon of thermal transpiration and disputes some of the claims made by Maxwell. Reynolds argues that Maxwell's method only applies to a specific case and does not fully explain the experimental results. He also refutes Maxwell's assumption that fine plates act as apertures in thin plates, asserting that the only sensible action in either case is that of tubes. Reynolds provides definite values for the coefficients in both limits and demonstrates the variation between them, emphasizing the importance of his method in understanding thermal transpiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Thermodynamics"}
