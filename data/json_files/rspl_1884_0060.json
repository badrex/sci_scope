The study reveals that the loss of energy is independent of the amplitude and is inversely proportional to the vibration period. The findings also show that the loss of energy is affected by factors such as temperature, fatigue of elasticity, and magnetic properties of the metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solid State Physics & Materials Science"}
