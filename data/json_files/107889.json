The study involved using various instruments and techniques to measure elevation and distance, ultimately finding that high-water mark in the Pacific is 3.55 feet higher than in the Atlantic at Chagres.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geography & Geophysics"}
