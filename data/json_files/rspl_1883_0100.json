The authors observe the plasticity and viscosity of strata, as well as the behavior of decarbonised iron under these conditions. Their findings suggest that the balance of forces holding together the molecules in a stratum can make it viscous and unyielding to small resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
