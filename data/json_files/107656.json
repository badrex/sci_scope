He observes a correlation between the abundance of carnivorous shellfish in younger strata and the rarity of such species in older formations, suggesting that the extinction of certain marine species may have been compensated by the emergence of new predatory groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Stratigraphy"}
