They also address the controversy surrounding potassium hyposulphite, a product of combustion, and its role in the explosion process. The authors argue that the reactions occurring among the powder constituents are susceptible to significant variations, making it difficult to provide a general chemical representation of the metamorphosis of gunpowder.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
