They observe that magnesium vapors injected into the Sun's chromosphere produce distinct spectral lines, and their experiments support the theory that most absorption occurs in the photosphere, which, along with the chromosphere, forms the Sun's true atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Stellar Astronomy"}
