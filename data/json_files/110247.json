He considers the essential properties of fluids and the conditions necessary for equilibrium, leading to the conclusion that the figure of the fluid is an oblate elliptical spheroid of revolution. The author also highlights the insufficiency of Clairaut's theory for determining the figure of a homogeneous planet.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Mechanics"}
