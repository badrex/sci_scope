Angus Smith investigates the actinism of the sun's rays and daylight using a chemical method involving iodide of potassium and nitric acid. The experiments show that plants absorb carbon dioxide during the day and exhale it at night, affecting the amount of carbon dioxide present in the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Environmental Chemistry"}
