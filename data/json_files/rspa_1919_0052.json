They find that the colors observed in the Foucault test are complementary to the colors in the diffraction patterns produced by the mica's striations. The study provides insight into the relationship between the luminosity of the striations and the relative retardation of wave-fronts on either side of the boundary.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
