The author finds that iron and steel can adjust their elastic limits to accommodate cyclically applied stress, preventing fatigue when the limits are properly adjusted. When the limits are not adjusted, work is absorbed during each cycle, leading to cracks and eventual fracture.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
