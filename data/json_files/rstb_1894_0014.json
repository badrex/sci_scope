The research focuses on understanding the representation of respiration in the highest nerve centers and the impact of various regions of the cerebral hemisphere being excited. The findings provide insights into the relationship between brain stimulation and respiratory movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
