The results show a slight increase in nitrogen outflow after exercise and a slight decrease during exercise. The study also highlights the challenges in maintaining a consistent nitrogen intake during such experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Nutrition"}
