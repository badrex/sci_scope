The gel can be formed in various solvents and is unique in its ability to convert into a gel directly with any solvent. The gel is labile to crystals and liquefies upon standing, with the presence of water stabilizing the gel state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry"}
