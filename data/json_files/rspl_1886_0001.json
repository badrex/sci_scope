The research finds that muscle tissue conducts heat differently depending on the direction of its fibers, while liver and kidney tissues lose conductivity rapidly after death. Bone tissue, both compact and spongy, also experiences conductivity changes after removal from their natural surroundings, with spongy tissue losing conductivity more quickly. Brain tissue, like liver and kidney, quickly loses its conduction ability after death and cannot be restored by moisture or fresh animal matter, though they may slow down the rate of loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
