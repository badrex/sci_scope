He discusses Plateau's experiments and Marangoni's theories, concluding that the special resistance experienced by a needle rotating on a water surface is due to surface contamination and not an inherent property of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloids"}
