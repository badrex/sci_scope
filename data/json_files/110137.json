The experiments aimed to measure the acceleration of the pendulum at different locations and determine the ellipticity of the Earth. The author took various precautions to ensure the accuracy of the measurements, including controlling the temperature and using a stable pendulum and clock. The results were used to calculate the Earth's ellipticity and provide insights into the Earth's shape and gravitational forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
