Arago's experiment, which claimed that the quantity of light polarized by reflection was equal to that of light polarized by refraction at any angle of incidence. Brewster demonstrates that the experiment's phenomena are the result of various refractions and reflections from both surfaces of the glass. He establishes a general law for the polarization of light reflected from the second surface of a transparent plate and provides formulae and tables for calculating the exact quantities of polarized light at all angles of incidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
