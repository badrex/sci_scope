He finds that each fibril is composed of minute cells, filled with a transparent substance called myoline, which has varying refractive densities. This discovery sheds light on the organization of muscle tissue and may provide new insights into the mechanism of muscle action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
