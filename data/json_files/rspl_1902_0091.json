They also find a close resemblance between the spectrum of 7 Cygni and the chromosphere, suggesting similar temperature and electrical conditions. The majority of the lines in 7 Cygni's spectrum are believed to be due to metallic vapours, rather than rarer atmospheric gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrochemistry & Spectroscopy"}
