He compares the structure to that of a nervous fibre and observes that both consist of rows of globules united by a transparent elastic gelatinous matter. The muscular fibre's globules are larger, and the elastic medium is less stretchy, making it more brittle than nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
