They find that at high velocities, the thermal effect is proportional to the square of the velocity, and that with very small velocities, the thermal effect is greatly increased by fluid friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
