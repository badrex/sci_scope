They describe the three parts of the cingulum and the three parts of the posterior corpus callosum, providing insights into their connections and functions. The study highlights the advantages of using the Marmoset monkey for brain research due to its small size and comparable brain arrangement to humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
