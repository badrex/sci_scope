He demonstrates that the process is independent of vital contractions and is a mechanical process resulting from endosmose. Rainey also shows that this process occurs even in plant parts that have lost their vitality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
