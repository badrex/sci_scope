He observes the extinguishing of lights and flames, the impact on animal life, and the lack of weight gain in moisture experiments, suggesting that the damps are not due to moisture or density differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Air Quality & Toxicology"}
