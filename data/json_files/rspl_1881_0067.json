The author discovers that the combined effect of torsion and longitudinal magnetization creates a state called 'polarization' in the wire, which persists even when the magnetizing force is removed. The phenomenon of hysteresis is also observed, where the change of polarization lags behind the change of torsion. The results provide insights into the behavior of magnetic materials and the underlying mechanisms of transient currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
