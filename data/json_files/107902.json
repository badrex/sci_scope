Dulong's experiments on the velocity of sound with the results of Drs. Moll and Van Beek's observations, finding that Dulong's calculations bring the velocity of sound calculations closer to the truth, but still with some discrepancies that may be due to errors in the complex observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Sound"}
