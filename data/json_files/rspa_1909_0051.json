The study reveals that the rate of decay is always significant, but waves with a certain limit, between 2 and 3, are more resistant to damping. The findings have implications for understanding wave behavior in various applications, such as optical instruments and water waves damped by oil.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Dynamics & Acoustics"}
