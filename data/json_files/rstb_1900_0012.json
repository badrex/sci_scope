The study confirms previous findings and reveals that the normal current in a fresh eyeball is positive, gradually declining to zero and becoming reversed. The author also observes that the normal current is influenced by light and darkness, with the zero-point reached within 15 minutes or less.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
