They propose a method to calculate the rate of heat transfer across a horizontal area using eddy motion and develop a formula for the propagation of heat by eddies in the atmosphere. The study provides insights into the relationship between eddy motion, temperature distribution, and heat transfer in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
