The serum is tested for its ability to neutralize endotoxins and protect against lethal doses of the typhoid toxin in rabbits. The results show that the goat's serum contains demonstrable antiendotoxins and agglutinins, with the highest titrate obtained at a dilution of 1/1,000,000.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Immunology & Microbiology"}
