The results show that flexural resistance is evenly distributed over the surface and is due to lateral cohesion between adjacent surfaces of fibers or particles. The author also determines the relationship between straining and resisting forces in different beam sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Structural Engineering"}
