He discusses the structure of the shell, the phragmocone, and the mantle, as well as the muscular fibers and organs of the Belemnite. The author concludes that Belemnites share characteristics with various existing genera, such as Sepia, Spirula, Onychoteuthis, and Rossia, and that they represent a unique combination of features.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Fossilization"}
