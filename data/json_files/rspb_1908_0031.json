They discover that emulsin contains three enzymes: gluco-lactase, \u03b2-glucase, and amygdalase. The study emphasizes the importance of enzymes as diagnostic agents and the challenges in separating and purifying them for further analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Enzymology"}
