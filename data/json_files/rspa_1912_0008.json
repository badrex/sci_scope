The method involves applying pressure to a solution in contact with a liquid, such as ether, to determine the pressure at which the liquid takes up the same amount of water from the solution as it does from water at normal pressure. The author demonstrates this method with a sugar solution and ether, finding that the osmotic pressure is approximately 79 atmospheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
