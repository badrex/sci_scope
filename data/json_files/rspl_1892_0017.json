The study suggests that the precoracoid element of the shoulder girdle was cartilaginous in Ichthyosaurus and that this cartilage usually articulated with the scapula and coracoids, completing the precoracoid foramen anteriorly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Vertebrate Anatomy & Evolution"}
