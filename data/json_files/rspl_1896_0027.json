The method allows for consistent results and is applicable to all types of thermometers. The authors also describe a platinum thermometer and bridge capable of indicating a change of 0.0001\u00b0, providing a more accurate control of the freezing process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
