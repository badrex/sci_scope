He conducts experiments on the coast of the Mediterranean in 1814 and 1815, passing the shocks through various circuits and materials, but finds no significant decomposition of water or magnetic effects. He concludes that the continuous flow of electricity in the torpedo's organ is too fast to produce measurable magnetic effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
