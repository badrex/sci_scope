They discover that both dominant and recessive white flowers contain oxidases, but only recessive whites lack the necessary chromogen for color production. The study demonstrates that the absence of color in some white flowers is due to the failure of chromogen and oxidase to interact, rather than the absence of essential color-forming components.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Genetics"}
