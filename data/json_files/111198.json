F. Baxter, investigates whether any signs of current force are present during the organic process of secretion in living animals. Using a galvanometer, Baxter found that an effect was produced when electrodes were placed in contact with secreted products and venous blood, indicating that the blood was positive. This study provides some explanation for previous failures in detecting current force in living animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
