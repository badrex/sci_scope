They faced challenges due to atmospheric conditions and the state of the air, but managed to record their observations and reduce them to apparent time. The team's findings contribute to the understanding of Venus's transit and the state of observational astronomy at the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Planetary Science"}
