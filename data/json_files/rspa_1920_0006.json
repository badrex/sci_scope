The author also highlights the variability of H curves in different storms and suggests that the classification of storms based on size and duration should be explicitly stated for accurate conclusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
