The poison's rapid action on the heart leads to a cessation of voluntary and reflex movements, while its direct impact on muscles and nerves is demonstrated through experiments involving partial exposure to the poison.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Toxicology"}
