They find that the conductivity of quartz varies significantly depending on the direction of measurement, and that no simple relationship exists between the conductivities of crystals and metals, as previously suggested by Kundt.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics"}
