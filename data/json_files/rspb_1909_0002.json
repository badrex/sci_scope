They provide a detailed description of the trypanosome's morphology and discuss the importance of considering multiple factors, such as infectivity, disease severity, and transmission methods, when classifying and naming trypanosome species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Pathogen Biology"}
