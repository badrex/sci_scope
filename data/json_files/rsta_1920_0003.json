Sir Charles Algernon Parsons investigates the artificial production of diamond through various experiments under high pressure and temperature conditions. His research focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to diamond formation and the effects of pressure on carbon, graphite, and iron. The experiments provide insights into the conditions required for diamond formation and the limitations of mechanical pressure in producing diamonds in rapidly cooled iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
