The child's ability to remain alive is attributed to her weak and sickly state, which may have left the foramen ovale unsealed. The girl's leg was trapped under a mill wheel, resulting in severe injuries. She lived for four days before succumbing to her wounds and bruises.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
