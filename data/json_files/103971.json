Desaguliers presents a machine that can quickly change the air in sick rooms by drawing out foul air and forcing in fresh air without opening doors or windows. The machine can be useful in hospitals, prisons, and for conveying warm or cold air to distant rooms. It also has the potential to subtly perfume rooms if needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Air Quality"}
