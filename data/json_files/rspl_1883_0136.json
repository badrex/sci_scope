They experiment with flint glasses of varying density and analyze their density, chemical composition, and resistance, concluding that increase in density and approach to a definite chemical composition lead to increased resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
