They study the orientation of these crystals in a magnetic field and find that the direction of maximum magnetic permeability may lie either in the cleavage plane or perpendicular to it, challenging the previously established relationship between the cleavage plane and magnetic properties of crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Crystallography"}
