The research also reveals that the ammonium salt is isomorphous but not eutropic with the alkali metallic salts, meaning it shares a similar structure but does not have the same properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry"}
