P. Perman, W. Ramsay, and J. Rose-Innes investigate the adiabatic relations of ethyl oxide, determining the wave-length of sound in gaseous and liquid ethyl oxide using Kundt's method. They also explore the mathematical discussion of the results and provide a set of adiabatic curves, which is the first time this has been done for any substance except perfect gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry"}
