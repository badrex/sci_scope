They also study molecular association in liquids, providing a method to determine molecular complexity of undiluted liquids. The results are demonstrated using various liquids, including alcohols and acetic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
