They discover that the volatile alkaloids contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, challenging the notion that these elements are released in simple forms like ammonia, and sulfur and phosphorus hydrogen compounds. The research also reveals that different volatile bodies are released during various stages of putrefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Toxicology"}
