The experiments also reveal that the muriate of lime can be reused multiple times by evaporating and crystallizing it. The author also explores the effects of combining muriate of lime with other salts, but finds no significant improvement in the cold production.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
