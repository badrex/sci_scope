They discover that the diffusivity constant for dilute CO2 remains consistent across various conditions and that the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the diameter of the aperture, not its area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
