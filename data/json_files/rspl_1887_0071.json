Thore", "topics": ["Molecular Forces", "Radiation Pressure", "Heat Radiation", "Atmospheric Pressure", "Vacuum Physics"], "tldr": "The author examines M. J. Thore's 'New Force' phenomenon, where a cylinder rotates when exposed to a warm body. Through a series of experiments, the author concludes that the rotation is caused by radiation from the warm body, and not a new force inherent in the human organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
