Despite the extreme cold and mechanical strain, no structural changes or impairment in bacterial vitality are detected, suggesting that bacteria can survive in extremely cold conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
