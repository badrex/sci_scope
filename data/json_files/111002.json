He explains the phenomenon using the wave theory and derives a formula for the number of bands produced. The method can be applied to determine the indices of substances that cannot form prisms and may be useful for mineralogists.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Wave Phenomena"}
