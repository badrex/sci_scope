The method involves a continuous water current containing dissolved CO2 flowing over the plant, with the difference in CO2 content before and after contact with the plant measuring the assimilation taking place.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
