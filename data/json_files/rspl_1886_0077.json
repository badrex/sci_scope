The research reveals that microorganisms are widely distributed in the atmosphere, but their numbers vary in different locations and at different times. The method allows for the cultivation of these microorganisms for further study and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microbial Ecology"}
