The pulmonary blood-pressure is affected by systemic pressure causing venous distension and an increased supply to the right side of the heart. The vaso-motor mechanism in pulmonary vessels is likely less developed than in systemic arteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Circulatory System"}
