He finds that these lines follow definite and general laws, suggesting that they are not influenced by local factors and do not support the hypothesis of a specific plurality of magnetic poles.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
