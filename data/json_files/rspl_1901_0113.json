The study aims to determine the effective solar temperature by considering various factors such as radiation loss from the heliostat mirror, absorption in the Earth's atmosphere, and the emissivity of the platinum strip. The author concludes that the effective temperature of the sun is approximately 6200\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Astrophysics"}
