They propose a hypothesis of a thin, variable layer of transition between transparent media to explain the phenomenon. The study avoids using hypothetical conditions and provides expressions for the intensities and phases of reflected and refracted light, taking into account terms of order.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Electromagnetism"}
