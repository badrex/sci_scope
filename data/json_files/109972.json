He also explores magnetization techniques and the relationship between needle length, directive force, and surface area. Kater's research aims to improve navigation instruments, particularly in the context of polar expeditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
