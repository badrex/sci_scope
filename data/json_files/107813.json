The system involves assigning names to moving parts, connecting the notation to the machine's drawings, indicating velocities, and representing the transmission of motion through arrows. This method aids in the identification of adjustments and the order in which they should be made.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Design"}
