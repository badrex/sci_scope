He extracts the gas and analyzes its properties, finding that it contains some nitrogen but is primarily composed of helium. This discovery expands the understanding of the chemical composition of minerals and the presence of elements in the Earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Mineralogy"}
