The electromotive force increases and decreases with temperature changes, with the highest recorded at 0.2607 volts at 197\u00b0F. Further research is needed to determine the efficiency of this element.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Thermodynamics"}
