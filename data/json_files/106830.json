The experiments involve using electrical sparks and heating substances like sulfur and charcoal to decompose the heavy inflammable air. The findings contribute to the understanding of the composition and properties of these airs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
