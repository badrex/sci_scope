The study also reveals that water does not play a direct role in the change, acting only as a solvent. The results provide insight into the complex nature of chemical reactions and the factors influencing their rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
