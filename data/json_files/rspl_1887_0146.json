The study focuses on the potential-energy-function for the strain in an element of the shell and the conditions for free edges. The paper also discusses spherical and cylindrical shells, as well as surfaces of uniform curvature.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanics & Materials Science"}
