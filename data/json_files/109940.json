He describes the construction of the pendulums and their appendages, and presents numerous tables of measurements. Kater also discusses the figure of the Earth and the determination of gravity using pendulums, concluding that the error in the number of vibrations of the seconds pendulum at any particular station does not amount to 1/11th of a vibration.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodesy & Geophysics"}
