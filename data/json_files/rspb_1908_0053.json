The author examines the effects of stimulating the inhibitory and accelerator nerves in the heart and the impact on muscle contractions. The findings suggest that these antagonistic actions occur at separate points in the cardiac mechanism and provide insight into the complex interactions between opposing reflexes in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
