Despite the damage caused by time and fire, efforts are being made to unroll and read these rolls, with some success. The process is slow and painstaking, but the rolls are believed to contain works of ancient Greek literature, including philosophical tracts and music theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences & Humanities", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Archaeology & History"}
