T Desaguliers, investigates the factors affecting water flow in pipes, particularly the role of air trapped within the pipes. He develops a new machine that removes air from pipes as water flows through them, improving the efficiency of water supply systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil & Environmental Engineering"}
