The study explores the potential impact of these changes on the Earth's shape and the position of its poles, concluding that a single large geological change could cause an alteration in the position of the pole by up to three degrees of latitude.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geodynamics & Geophysics"}
