They discuss their preliminary findings, including the reversal of lines in various elements and the behavior of calcium lines, and express optimism about the method's potential to solve complex spectroscopic problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
