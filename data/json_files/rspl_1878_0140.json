They observe that the vapours of these metals are extremely opaque to the light of the refrangibility absorbed, and that the reversal of these lines occurs almost as readily as that of the D lines by sodium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
