The study shows that the absence of oxygen leads to a greater formation of ptomaines, while a free supply of oxygen prevents their formation entirely. This research supports Pasteur's views on the relationship between fermentation processes and the absence of oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Bacteriology"}
