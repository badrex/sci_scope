They conclude that the transfer of electricity requires the presence of ponderable matter, rather than the ether, and discuss the implications for the height and visibility of the aurora borealis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
