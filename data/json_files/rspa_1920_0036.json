They show that the total magnetic susceptibility of metals is the sum of the susceptibility due to the atoms and that due to the free electrons. The presence of free electrons in a metal should produce diamagnetic susceptibility, which could explain the observed behavior of some diamagnetic metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
