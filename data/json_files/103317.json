The experiment involves dropping a Guinea and a piece of paper in a long, multi-chambered glass receiver, demonstrating that the presence of an interspersed vacuum affects the fall of objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Experimental Physics & Fluid Dynamics"}
