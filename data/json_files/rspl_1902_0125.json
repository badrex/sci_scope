The study reveals that the facial region of the skull becomes shortened due to the increase in tusks and the presence of the proboscis. The maxillae become enlarged, and the mandible becomes more elongated as the stature of the animals increases. The changes in the upper and lower dentition, including the loss of incisors and the development of complex molars, are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
