He finds that the decomposition of the solution of iodide of potassium can occur without direct metallic contact, proving that metallic contact is not necessary for the production of the voltaic current.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications"}
