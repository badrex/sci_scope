The study examines the effects of various substances and their concentrations on the electromotive force and the balance of the voltaic couple. The results show that the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset the balance is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the substance and its state of combination when dissolved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Reactions"}
