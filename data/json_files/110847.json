Colonel Sabine's observations on terrestrial magnetism during the Antarctic Expedition on board Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror reveal a duplicate system of magnetic phenomena in the southern hemisphere, similar to the northern hemisphere. The study also confirms that the spaces in the Southern Pacific undergo a translation movement from east to west, opposite to the direction in the northern hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
