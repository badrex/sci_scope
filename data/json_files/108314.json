Forbes, investigates the flow of plastic bodies and the motion of glaciers by creating experiments with viscous fluids. He observes that the lines of separation in these models resemble the crevasses found in glaciers, providing evidence for the viscous theory of glacier motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Geophysics"}
