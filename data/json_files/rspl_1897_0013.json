This research provides experimental evidence supporting the idea that the paired segmental bodies correspond to the medulla of the suprarenals in higher vertebrates, while the interrenal body corresponds to the cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Comparative Physiology & Zoology"}
