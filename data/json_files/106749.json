He describes a method for locating and measuring the distance between stars, which involves using neighboring stars as references. The catalogue includes information on the relative magnitude, color, and position of the stars, and Herschel discusses the differences in observations that may arise from using different telescope powers and observing conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astro-Geography & Star Classification"}
