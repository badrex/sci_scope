Wood's research on a new class of organic bases led to the discovery of ninaphthylamine, a substance formed through a unique substitution process involving binoxide of nitrogen. This finding expands the understanding of nitro-derivatives of aromatic monamines and offers new possibilities for further research in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
