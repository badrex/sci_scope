The results show that resonance radiation behaves differently under electrical and fluorescent excitation, and that the intensity of resonance radiation decreases with increasing magnetic field strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
