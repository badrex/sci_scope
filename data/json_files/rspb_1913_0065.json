The authors explore the various factors that influence pigment formation, including genetic factors, enzyme action, and the presence of inhibitors. They also discuss the significance of striping and streaking patterns in flowers, which they attribute to local inhibition of oxydase or a lack of chromogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
