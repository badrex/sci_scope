They also find that sunlight has no effect on the rate of change in the presence of an iodide, but in the absence of an iodide, the oxidizing substance accumulates and its further production is impeded.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
