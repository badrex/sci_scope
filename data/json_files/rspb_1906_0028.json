The findings indicate that the fermentation process is different from that of B. coli communis, and the missing carbon is possibly due to the presence of reduction products of sugar.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Microbial Metabolism"}
