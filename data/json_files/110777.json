He applies this theory to verify previous conclusions and suggests additional experiments to clarify ambiguities. Daniell also provides practical remarks on various voltaic battery arrangements and explains the principles behind his own cylindrical battery design.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
