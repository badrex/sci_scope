The deposits are found to be mainly composed of barium sulfate, with some strontium and calcium sulfate. The authors discuss possible causes for the deposition, including double decomposition, temperature changes, and the presence of barium sulfate veins in coal measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Mineralogy"}
