They find that certain mixtures of thorium oxide and cerium oxide produce the maximum luminosity, and that the incandescence is due to the high temperature generated by the bombardment of cathode rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Optical Physics"}
