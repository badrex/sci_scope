He provides a detailed analysis of the discriminant and reciprocant of a quaternary quadric and explores the Hessian of a cubic. Additionally, he introduces new concomitant functions and forms tables of important results.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
