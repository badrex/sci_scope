He proposes that the sensation of different colors depends on the frequency of vibrations excited by light in the retina. Young also compares his theory to Newton's work and examines the phenomena of thin plates and striated substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
