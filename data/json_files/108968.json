The study also explores the viscosity of gases, finding that it is independent of density and proportional to the absolute temperature. The author also examines heat conduction in gases and the conduction of heat in mixtures of gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics"}
