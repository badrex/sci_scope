The skull exhibits unique features, such as a large inter-orbital portion and a thick, flattened sagittal crest. The author suggests that this species represents a specialized and gigantic member of the Lemuroidea sub-order and proposes the establishment of a new genus for this fossil.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
