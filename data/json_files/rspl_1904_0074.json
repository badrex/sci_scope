The study suggests that the motion of air in these latitudes is more of a passage around the pole in a general easterly direction, with air moving from west to east and diverging in the northern hemisphere towards the north over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate"}
