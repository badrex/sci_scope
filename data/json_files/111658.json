Wharton Jones, investigates his own eye's focal power for horizontal and vertical rays and determines whether it possesses a power of adjustment for different distances. He finds that his eyes are not monostigmatic, meaning they cannot collect all rays of light to one exact focus, but rather distigmatic, with two distinct foci for horizontal and vertical rays. He also concludes that his eyes do not have an intrinsic power of adjustment for different distances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Vision Science"}
