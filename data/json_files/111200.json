He concludes that the dentate body forms a tubular investment around the extremity of the processus e cerebello ad testem, connected with the opposite body by a commissure of grey matter. Its interior receives fibres of the cerebro-cerebellar peduncle, while its exterior radiates fibres to various lobes of the cerebellum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neuroanatomy"}
