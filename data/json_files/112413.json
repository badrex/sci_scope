Through careful observation and microscopy techniques, the author demonstrates that the so-called nucleus is a result of post-mortem changes and disturbances during preparation for examination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
