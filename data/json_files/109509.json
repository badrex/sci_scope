He explains these phenomena using theoretical principles and demonstrates them through experiments with fluids of varying densities. The author also discusses the role of temperature differences and heat sources in producing these effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
