The study concludes that gases like helium in Earth's atmosphere and water vapor in Mars' atmosphere are highly unlikely to escape due to their critical density ratios and the time required for significant leakage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
