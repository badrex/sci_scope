He suggests using non-conducting substances in front of the cushion and conducting substances behind it, as well as optimizing the use of amalgam and silk flaps. These improvements result in a more powerful and consistent electrical machine, regardless of weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
