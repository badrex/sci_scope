The findings suggest that the yield can be represented by a combination of five harmonic components, providing a valuable insight into the factors affecting agricultural productivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Agriculture & Meteorology"}
