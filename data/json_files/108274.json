Through a series of experiments, he concludes that the proper and muscular currents are generally subjected to the same laws and both vary in the same sense under the same circumstances. The proper current is found to be more affected by temperature, respiration, circulation, and sulphuretted hydrogen than the muscular current.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurophysiology & Muscle Physiology"}
