Spottiswoode shares his findings on the successful photography of stratified discharges in hydrogen tubes using a revolving mirror and a sensitive plate. The photographic image reveals the position, proper motion, and grouping of striae with different actinic power and color. Spottiswoode plans to present a more comprehensive study in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics"}
