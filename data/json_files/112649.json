The study compares the nitrogen excretion of two healthy soldiers and reveals a close relationship between body weight and urinary excretion. The results suggest that some nitrogen may be eliminated through the intestines, highlighting the importance of considering both renal and intestinal excretion in understanding nitrogen balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Nutrition"}
