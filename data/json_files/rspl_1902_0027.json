They observe that prolonged exposure to high temperatures causes the metal to change its surface pattern, which is similar to the etched surface of a crystalline metal. This phenomenon is due to the recrystallization of the strained metal, which occurs when it is exposed to high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
