The author demonstrates that the strength of tubes varies inversely with their length and diameter, and proposes modifications to boiler construction to improve safety and prevent accidents caused by tube collapse.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
