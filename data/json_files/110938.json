He demonstrates that human foetuses, like those of other higher animals, have albuminous or nutritious matter that undergoes digestion in the small intestines during later intra-uterine life. The nature of this substance varies among different animals, and Robinson suggests that the salivary glands may be the source of this matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
