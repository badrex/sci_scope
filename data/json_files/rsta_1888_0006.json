The author develops relations between the cubic curve and these lines, and explores their geometric significance, including the envelope of the complex, the poloid, and the centroid of the cubic.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Algebra"}
