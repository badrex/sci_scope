The study reveals that the moon's passage over both the inferior and superior meridian produces a slight increase in pressure, with a maximum curve at both points. The pressure is also found to be greater around new moon than full moon and greater in the third and fourth quarters than the first and second quarters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
