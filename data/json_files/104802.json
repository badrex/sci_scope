The device is simple, cost-effective, and can be used both on land and at sea. It can also assist in predicting weather changes and is not affected by the expansion and contraction of the deal rod due to heat and cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
