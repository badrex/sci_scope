Clifford, establishes theorems related to the nature of space in which curves can exist, the representation of these curves in flat spaces of lower dimensions, and their properties. He also discusses the classification of curves and loci, including unicursal and elliptic curves, and the existence of curves in various dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
