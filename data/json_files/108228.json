They provide detailed analysis of their properties, including their solubility, ash content, and elemental composition. The author suggests that resins may be composed of multiple compound radicals and that further research is needed to understand their constitution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
