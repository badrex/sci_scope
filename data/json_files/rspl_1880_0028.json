Thudichum and Professor Roscoe regarding the presence of potassium in Liebreich's 'Protagon.' Thudichum argues that 'Protagon' contains foreign substances, including potassium, while Roscoe claims that his analysis shows otherwise. The debate continues with Roscoe's recent findings, which seem to support Thudichum's position.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
