The osmotic pressure of colloidal solutions is found to depend on the composition and history of the system, and the author provides a theoretical framework for understanding interfacial tension and electric polarization in colloidal systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry"}
