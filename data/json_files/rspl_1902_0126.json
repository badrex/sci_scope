The authors found that the arrangement of motor cells in the spinal cord correlates with the character of the body part supplied with motor nerves, such as limbs, trunk muscles, and genital muscles. The study also describes unrecorded features in the porpoise's spinal cord structure, including the position of the nucleus of the spinal accessory nerve and a detached mass of grey matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
