The study provides a theoretical analysis of the wave propagation and offers insights into the determination of epicenters of earthquakes and inferences about the Earth's interior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Seismology & Earthquake Studies"}
