The experiments show that platinum plates can be charged and discharged like condensers, and that the electrostatic capacity of these plates increases with the potential. The author also explores the relationship between electrostatic induction and water decomposition, suggesting that a film separates the platinum plate from the water, and that this film's properties affect the electrical behavior of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
