The method involves using an induction coil to create deposits of different tenuity, which can be analyzed for their color and composition. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in detecting gold, silver, and other precious metals in various materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
