Observations reveal that temperature progression is not regular at all heights, with a certain height range exhibiting a constant or slightly increasing temperature before resuming its downward course. The study also notes the existence of moisture in the atmosphere, which may affect temperature changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
