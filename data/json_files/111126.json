He discovers that the presence of nitric acid in urine increases after consuming ammonia compounds, suggesting that the body converts ammonia into nitric acid through oxidation. Additionally, the author finds that nitric acid can be produced from various combustions, including alcohol, coal, and hydrogen, and may exist in rainwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
