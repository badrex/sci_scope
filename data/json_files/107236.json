The fungi absorb all nutrients from the soil beneath the ring, causing the surrounding grass to die. Over time, the ring expands as the fungi consume nutrients and the grass regrows. The author also notes that different species of fungi require the same nutrients, which can cause interference between adjacent rings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
