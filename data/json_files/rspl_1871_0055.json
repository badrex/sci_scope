They discuss the superiority of photographic sun-observations over previous methods and the distribution of sunspots on the solar surface. The authors also express a hope for more extensive solar observations in the future, connecting solar phenomena with terrestrial meteorology and magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomy & Astrophysics"}
