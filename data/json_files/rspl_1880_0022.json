The author also suggests that at high exhaustions, the mean length of path between molecular collisions becomes comparable with the diameter of the case, leading to a notable fall in the rate at which heat is conveyed from the case to the thermometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
