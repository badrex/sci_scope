The process involves dissolving the ducket in aqua regia, dipping a rag in the solution, and rubbing the silver with the rag, using a little spittle for better adhesion. If the silver doesn't take, the rag is burned to remove grease, and the process is repeated.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
