Frankland, investigates the substitution of organic radicals in inorganic compounds, specifically focusing on the oxygen compounds of boron and silicon. He discovers a new series of organic compounds containing boron, boric ethide, by replacing the oxygen in boracic acid with ethyl groups. This research expands the understanding of organometallic compounds and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
