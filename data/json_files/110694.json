Frederic Daniell investigates the electrolysis of secondary compounds and their constitution, focusing on the grouping of chemical elements to form radicles. He establishes the principle that inorganic oxy-acid salts should be considered compounds of metals or ammonium, and compound anions like chlorine and iodine. Daniell's experiments support Davy's hypothesis on the general analogy in the constitution of all salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
