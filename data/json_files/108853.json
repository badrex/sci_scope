The study also reveals that the supposed differences in oxygen properties among peroxides do not exist and that the effects of oxidation can be achieved by modifying the experiment's circumstances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactions"}
