He finds that the curves representing the rise and fall of tides are different for high and low tides and are not the same as the line of sines. Airy also explains a previously perplexing circumstance regarding the age of the tide, depending on whether it is estimated by height or time of high water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrology"}
