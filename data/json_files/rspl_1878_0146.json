However, under more powerful electrical action, the scattering of drops increases. The phenomenon is explained by the repulsion between electrified drops and the amalgamation of drops under weak electrical influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrostatics"}
