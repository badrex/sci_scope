Davy discusses his experiments on the magnetic phenomena produced by electricity. He found that an electric current passing through a wire could make the wire magnetic and that steel needles placed in the circuit would become permanent magnets. The magnetic effect was proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through the wire, and the magnetic poles of the needles were determined by their position relative to the wire and the direction of the electric current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
