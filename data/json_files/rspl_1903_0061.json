The authors find that the amount of CO2 assimilated increases with temperature, reaching a peak at around 38\u00b0C before declining rapidly. They also discover that the leaf's internal temperature can be significantly higher than the surrounding environment due to absorbed light radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
