They discover that the corpus callosum is not an interhemispheric commissure but a decussation of cortical fibers connecting to the basal ganglia. The study also reveals the existence of the crossed callosal tract, which plays a significant role in the brain's connectivity and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
