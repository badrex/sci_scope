The study reveals that a certain amount of pressure can be compensated for, but beyond that point, it causes physiological effects such as changes in respiration, blood pressure, and pupil dilation. The results also show that the brain's ability to compensate for pressure changes decreases with repeated experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurology & Neurosurgery"}
