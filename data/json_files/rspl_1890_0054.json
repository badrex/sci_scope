The authors find that nitrous acid is the initial product of reduction, and that the presence of nitric acid in slight excess can interfere with the reaction. The study also explores the role of hydrogen gas in reducing nitric acid to nitrous acid and its effects on metal nitrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Redox Reactions"}
