He finds that boiled water freezes faster and attributes this to the agitation caused by the air entering the water as it cools, which prevents it from reaching a lower temperature without freezing.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
