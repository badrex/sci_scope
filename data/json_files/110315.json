He provides a detailed anatomical description of the development and arrangement of the nerves, as well as the changes they undergo during the transition from the larva to the pupa stage. Newport also discusses the similarities between the insect's nervous system and those of vertebrates, and the possible functions of certain nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Biology"}
