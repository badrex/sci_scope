They describe the setup, including the use of a rotating disc and a galvanometer, and discuss the challenges and solutions encountered during the process. The results provide a more accurate measurement of resistance, contributing to the understanding of electrical circuits and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Circuits"}
