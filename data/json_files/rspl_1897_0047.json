They find that injecting healthy cattle with rinderpest blood prevents coagulation results in a successful infection. Additionally, they discover that nasal mucus from infected animals can also transmit the disease. The study highlights the importance of lymphatic gland swelling as a key indicator of the disease and the development of immunity following a mild attack.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Infectious Diseases"}
