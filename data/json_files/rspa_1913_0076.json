They also discuss the differences in properties between palladium black and other forms of the metal, suggesting that the rapid occlusion of hydrogen may be due to the presence of amorphous palladium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
