Experiments on frog hearts reveal that alkaline solutions increase tonicity and alter the character of cardiac beats, while acid solutions decrease tonicity and weaken beats. Similar effects are observed in arterial muscles. The author plans to discuss the implications of these findings further in future work.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology"}
