He concludes that the recoil-engine cannot be used advantageously due to its lower efficiency and duty compared to other machines, and suggests that a more elastic fluid may improve mechanical power.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering"}
