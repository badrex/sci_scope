The cells are sensitive to a wide range of light wavelengths, with the maximum response in the yellow spectrum. The study aims to determine the energy of incident light and its potential applications in astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
