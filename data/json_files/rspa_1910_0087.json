The observations revealed oscillations of shorter intervals than tidal periods, which the researchers believe to be seiches. The study also recorded a higher tidal range than expected, with a difference of up to 6 feet.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
