They explore the mesial surface of the hemisphere and discover that stimulating specific areas of the marginal convolution can cause coordinated movements in the trunk and limbs. Their research contributes to the understanding of the localization of functions within the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
