They discover that salts can inhibit the formation of complex polymers by adsorbing onto the surface of colloidal molecules, preventing them from reacting with one another. This phenomenon is observed in the formation of precipitates when formaldehyde is added to Witte's peptone and in the interaction between zinc sulfate and protein solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical & Analytical Chemistry"}
