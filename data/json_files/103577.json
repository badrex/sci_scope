This method softens the wood, allowing it to be bent easily and holds the shape better than traditional burning methods. It also preserves the edges of the plank, making the work stronger and the caulking last longer.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Engineering & Shipbuilding"}
