Alfred Wanklyn's Critique", "topics": ["Organic Chemistry", "Sodium Chemistry", "Ether Reactions", "Chemical Reactions and Pressure", "Hydrogen Evolution"], "tldr": "Frankland and Duppa respond to Wanklyn's critique of their interpretation of the reaction between sodium and acetic ether. They argue that Wanklyn's experiments, conducted under high pressure in sealed tubes, differ significantly from their own experiments, and that pressure can affect reactions involving gas evolution. They maintain that their interpretation, which includes the evolution of hydrogen, is still valid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms"}
