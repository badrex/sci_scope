The author argues that while reproductive selection can cause progressive changes in a species, it cannot differentiate a species into sub-groups without the influence of other factors, such as natural selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary Biology & Genetics"}
