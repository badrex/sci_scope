'Iron Duke' to China, Japan, and surrounding areas between 1871 and 1875. The observations were made using a dip-circle and provide data for determining secular changes in terrestrial magnetism at various locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
