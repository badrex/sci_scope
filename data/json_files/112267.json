{"article_id": "112267", "revised_title": "Cyclone Theory Development and Atmospheric Currents", "topics": ["Meteorology", "Cyclones", "Atmospheric Circulation", "Barometric Pressure", "Wind Patterns"], "tldr": "Francis Galton explores cyclone theory and the behavior of atmospheric currents, proposing that barometric depression areas are loci of ascending currents and surface winds, while barometric elevation areas are loci of descending currents. He suggests that continuous dispersion of currents can result in the yielding of east and west winds to the curvature of others, leading to a disposition of currents like those in an anticyclone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
