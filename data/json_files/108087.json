The author also explores the chemical nature of these crystals and their various forms, as well as their ability to analyze polarized light, a property previously known only in tourmaline and a few other natural minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Materials Science"}
