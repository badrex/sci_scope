Using a Graham's watch and an exquisite quadrant, he determined the time of Mercury's exit and the distance of the Sun's upper limb from the zenith. His observation, compared with that made by Mr. Short, helped fix the longitude of the observation site in Antigua.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics"}
