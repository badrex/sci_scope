They find that substances can be grouped according to their absorption spectra, and that this grouping aligns with the chemical grouping of compounds. The research focuses on the longer waves of the spectrum, as they are more likely to be affected by complex bodies than shorter waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
