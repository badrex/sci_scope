The study involves calculating the attraction on a body composed of spheroidal layers and determining the equation of equilibrium for such a mass. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the Earth's shape and gravitational forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
