The study reveals that the blastopore remains open throughout development and that the mesoblast originates from the differentiation of yolk cells in the angles formed by the invaginated mesenteron and the epiblast.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
