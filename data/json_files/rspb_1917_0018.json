They find that the most effective germicidal portion of the ultra-violet spectrum is between 2940 to 2380 Angstrom units, and that this region corresponds almost exactly with the portion of the spectrum absorbed by the bacterial emulsion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Infectious Diseases"}
