He explains that the petiolus, or leaf stem, is the seat of both sense and action, and that the leaves move in a regular and gradual manner. The author also notes that the leaves change positions throughout the day and that they are more active at night.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
