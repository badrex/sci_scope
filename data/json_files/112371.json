The study reveals significant changes in the curves of diurnal inequality, with some years showing larger and others smaller curves. The author also discusses the lunar inequalities and their relationship to solar effects, suggesting two possible explanations for the observed changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
