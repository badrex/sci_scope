The authors find that while these substances can render the poison inert, they do not prevent its absorption into the bloodstream and ultimately do not save the animal from death when injected with a lethal dose of the poison.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Toxicology & Pharmacology"}
