The arch is made of large stones locked together to minimize the risk of one dropping out and causing the structure to collapse. This innovative design is accompanied by dimensions and details of the chimney's construction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Civil Engineering & Architecture"}
