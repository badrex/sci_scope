A. Raisin and Professor Bonney study the formation of structures during the drying process of fluids with suspended particles. They observe that the structures are influenced by the rate of evaporation and the size of the particles, leading to changes in porosity and potential applications in ceramic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Ceramics"}
