The cloth was found to resist burning and maintain its integrity even when exposed to high heat and oil. The Society conducted multiple experiments to study the properties of the cloth and its potential uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
