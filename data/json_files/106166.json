J. A. de Luc, presents a new hygrometer for measuring humidity, focusing on the extreme humidity produced by water. He explains the importance of a fixed point for measuring humidity and discusses the challenges he faced in developing the hygrometer. The new hygrometer is based on the soaking power of melting ice, providing a simple and effective method for measuring humidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
