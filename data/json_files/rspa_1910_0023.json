The study reveals that instantaneity of propagation is a result of the fluid being considered incompressible and that the presence of discontinuities in the initial conditions can lead to the formation of wavefronts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Fluid Mechanics & Acoustics"}
