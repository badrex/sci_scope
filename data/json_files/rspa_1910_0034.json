They find that the depression of the freezing point is connected with the ionisation of the solute, and that the coefficient of ionisation can be determined by the molecular depression and the equivalent conductivity of the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Solutions"}
