It also discusses the comparison of algebraic and functional transcendents, and extends the theory of definite integrals. The author introduces a symbol, 0, which is used in the expression of the theorem and its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Calculus"}
