They construct two types of micro-balances, one for measuring small alterations in weight and another for absolute weight determinations, both with high levels of accuracy and sensitiveness.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Instrumentation"}
