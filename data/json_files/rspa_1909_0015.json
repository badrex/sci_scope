The results show that air has a specific heat of 0.24173 cal/gram-degree at 20\u00b0C and 0.24301 cal/gram-degree at 100\u00b0C, while carbon dioxide has a specific heat of 0.20202 cal/gram-degree at 20\u00b0C and 0.22121 cal/gram-degree at 100\u00b0C. The findings are accurate to within one part in 1000 and provide a better understanding of the thermal properties of these gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
