Dupr\u00e9 conducts experiments to determine how alcohol is metabolized and eliminated from the body. The results show that all alcohol consumed daily must be disposed of daily, either through oxidation or elimination, and that the amount of alcohol eliminated in breath and urine is a small fraction of the amount consumed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
