Thallium is found in iron pyrites containing copper, as well as in native sulfur, zinc, cadmium, bismuth, mercury, and antimony ores. The author also presents a process for extracting thallium from its ores.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Materials"}
