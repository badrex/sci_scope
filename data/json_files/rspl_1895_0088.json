Thomson investigates the discharge of electricity when R\u00f6ntgen rays interact with electrified bodies and dielectrics. He finds that these rays can cause a rapid discharge of both positive and negative charges, and that they can make dielectrics conductive, suggesting a molecular splitting process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
