W. Johnston, Esq., F.R.S., presents a paper on a new equi-atomic compound of bicyanide with binoxide of mercury. The salt is characterized by its sparing solubility in cold water, strong alkaline reaction, and susceptibility to detonation by heat. The analysis of the salt reveals its composition and formula.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
