They discover a law that states that two times the strength of a solution results in three times the chemical action. This law holds true for various combinations of metals and salts, and the authors propose that it is a primary law in chemical dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Dynamics & Reaction Kinetics"}
