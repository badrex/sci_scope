The results suggest that thyroid extract may act similarly to cervical sympathetic stimulation, and the increased secretion of the altered thyroid in Graves' disease could be a cause of exophthalmos in that condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Endocrinology & Hormones"}
