He conducts experiments to compare its resistance to nitric acid with other tanning substances and explores its behavior under various conditions. The artificial substance proves to be more indestructible than other tanning materials, but there are still differences in its resistance to nitric acid when compared to natural sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
