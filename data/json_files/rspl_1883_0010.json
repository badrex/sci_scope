The study reveals that uric acid is not formed in the animal body during metabolism but is produced in the renal organs themselves. The kidneys do not filter uric acid from the blood, and its presence in the blood can be converted into urate of sodium under certain circumstances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
