They find that the highest pressure and most rapid explosion occurs when the oxygen in the air is just completely burnt. The time of explosion and the ratio of maximum to initial pressure are affected by the initial pressure and the composition of the gas mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Thermodynamics"}
