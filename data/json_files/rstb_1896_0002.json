The study finds that abduction is represented in the cerebral cortex, but adduction is more powerfully represented, making it difficult to obtain a stimulus strong enough to evoke abduction without also stimulating the adductor center.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
