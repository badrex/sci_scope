They find that the stability of these hydrosols is influenced by factors such as the presence of free acids, alkalis, and neutral salts, and that the particles' electrical charge plays a crucial role in their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry"}
