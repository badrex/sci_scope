Different salts and other soluble substances in solution are found to have varying degrees of power in retarding or accelerating evaporation. The study provides insights into the factors affecting evaporation and the potential use of pans as hygrometers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
