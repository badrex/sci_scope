They find that the latencies for different muscles of the same animal have a proportional relationship, but the relationship varies between different animal groups. The study provides insights into the functional adaptations of muscles in different animals and their motor requirements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Anatomy"}
