By analyzing the spectral characteristics and comparing them to the solar spectrum, the author concludes that these stars represent an advanced stage in the cooling of meteoritic vapours and suggests a classification system based on the gradual addition of other absorptions to carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
