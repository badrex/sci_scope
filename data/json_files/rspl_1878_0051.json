The author conducted experiments at various altitudes and found that the absolute and relative quantity of carbonic acid exhaled increases with higher altitudes, while the rate of respiration remains the same.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
