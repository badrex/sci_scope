They find that the internal temperature of leaves exposed to natural light is a significant factor affecting the rate of carbon-dioxide assimilation, and that direct sunlight can cause a considerable rise in leaf temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Physiology & Ecology"}
