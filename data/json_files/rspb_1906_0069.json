They discover that these substances exhibit unique characteristics, such as double refraction and the ability to form fluid crystals. The study provides insights into the complex nature of biological structures and their relationship with crystalline formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
