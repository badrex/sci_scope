The study reveals that these arteries originally derived from the dorsal aorta for the supply of the midgut and reach their destinations through the mesentery, adapting to its changes. The findings suggest wider applicability beyond the human subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
