H. Christie and Henry Foster, report on the repetition of experiments conducted by Christie on the magnetic properties imparted to an iron plate by rotation. They found that the plate caused deviations in a horizontal needle depending on the direction and position of the plate, suggesting an intermediate latitude where no deviations would be produced by rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Electromagnetism"}
