Experiments show that oxidation increases the vital properties of these tissues, and that the absence of oxygen or the introduction of carbonic acid can reduce this increase. This research provides insight into the role of oxygen in nerve function and the potential for therapeutic applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Neurophysiology"}
