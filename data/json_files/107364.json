These fringes are formed by the intersections of two sets of concentric rings and are divided into two classes based on the position of their colors. The author also explores different apparatuses to produce these fringes and their unique appearances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
