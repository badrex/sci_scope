The researchers examine specimens of both black and white particles found in Mycetoma and identify two distinct fungi, one responsible for the black particles and the other for the white particles. They also discuss the tissue reactions and the transformation of the fungi within the affected tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Infectious Diseases"}
