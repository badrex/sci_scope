Guthrie uses a diathermometer to measure the resistance of liquids, including water, and finds that hotter water conducts heat better than colder water. The study also shows that the addition of salts to water increases its thermal resistance, and provides a list of specific liquid resistances compared to water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
