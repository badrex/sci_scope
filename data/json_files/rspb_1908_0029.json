They find that phosphates play a crucial role in accelerating fermentation and that they are converted into a form not precipitable by magnesia-mixture. The study also shows that phosphates are regenerated through enzymatic hydrolysis, contributing to the overall fermentation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Microbiology & Biochemistry"}
