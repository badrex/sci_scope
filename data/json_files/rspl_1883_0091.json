The research reveals that magnetic capacity is directly related to the softness or molecular freedom of the material, and resistance to external magnetizing force is directly related to its hardness or molecular rigidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
