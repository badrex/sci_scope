He concludes that the substance is a weak chemical compound of antimony and acid hydrochlorate of terchloride, decomposable by heat, and that the observed changes are due to molecular alterations and partial chemical decompositions based on the temperature and discharge rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Materials Chemistry"}
