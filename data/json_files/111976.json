He finds that the prevailing direction of earth-currents is approximately N.E. or S.W., and that these currents are not determined by local causes. The author also notes that earth-currents are influenced by meteorological conditions and local variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
