The results show that the poison causes a primary failure of respiration, followed by a rise in blood pressure, respiratory convulsions, and a sudden fall in blood pressure after respiration ceases. The study also examines the potential direct action of the poison on the heart and its effects on blood pressure and the heart's response to artificial respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Toxicology & Venomous Animals"}
