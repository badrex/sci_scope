He finds that the specific heat at constant volume is a function of temperature only, and the internal energy and entropy can be expressed as the sum of two functions, one depending on temperature and the other on volume.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry"}
