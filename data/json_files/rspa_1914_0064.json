It finds that the Curie law of constancy of diamagnetism holds for most substances, with a change in specific susceptibility during the transition from the liquid to the crystalline state. The results are considered in relation to crystal structure and the complex nature of diamagnetic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
