He hypothesizes that many double-stars are real binary combinations of two stars held together by mutual attraction. Through a series of observations and calculations, Herschel concludes that the small star in the pair is in a rotating motion around the larger star or both stars move around a common center of gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astro Mechanics & Celestial Mechanics"}
