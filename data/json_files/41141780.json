Foster presents observations of the daily variation of a magnetic needle at Port Bowen, noting that the maximum intensity occurs around 7 PM, and the minimum intensity is less defined, happening somewhat later in the morning. The study also suggests that the southern declination of the moon may have an influence on the daily variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
