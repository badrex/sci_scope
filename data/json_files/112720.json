The compound is an ether and has unique properties, such as being difficultly soluble in water but dissolving readily in boiling alcohol and ether. The formation of this compound is expressed through a chemical equation, and its reaction with hydrochloric acid is also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Compounds"}
