The study also reveals the importance of the chemical constitution and the complexity of molecules in absorption and radiation processes. Furthermore, the author discusses the optical properties of substances and their relation to the periods of oscillation of ethereal waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
