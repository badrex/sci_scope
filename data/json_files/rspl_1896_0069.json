They discover that helium can be separated from other gases, such as argon, through absorption by platinum. The process also serves as a method of separating helium from other gases present in mineral springs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Gas Separation"}
