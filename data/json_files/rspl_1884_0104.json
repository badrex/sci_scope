The research finds that alcohol vapour in contact with liquid acquires a normal density at about 50\u00b0C, and does not exhibit the same tendencies as other compounds when temperature and pressure are lowered.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry"}
