Eardley Wilmot observed a large and luminous spot in the sea during his voyage home from the Cape of Good Hope. He collected a sample of the water, which was analyzed by Dr. Faraday. The water contained a high amount of sulphuretted hydrogen and a solid deposit consisting of half sulfur and half organic matter. This suggests that the water was rich in animals or animalcules, and the luminosity could be attributed to bioluminescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Biology"}
