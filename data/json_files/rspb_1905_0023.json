They find that a solution of potassium salts is present at every site of injury to a nerve fiber, which supports the idea that inorganic salts play a significant role in nerve function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
