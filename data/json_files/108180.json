The study explores two possible scenarios for the Earth's current state: a solid exterior shell and a solid central nucleus with a layer of molten material between them, or a completely solid Earth. The thickness of the solid shell or the radius of the solid nucleus in the first scenario may be small compared to the Earth's radius.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodynamics"}
