The observations include measurements of deflection, vibration, and dip, with calculations for horizontal, vertical, and total forces in English measure. The author discusses the instruments used, the system of observation and reduction, and the corrections applied to the data. The study aims to determine the ratio and product of the magnetic moment and the earth's horizontal magnetic intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
