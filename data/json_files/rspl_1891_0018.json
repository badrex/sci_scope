They describe their experimental setup and findings, which indicate that the heat produced by compression may vary inversely with atomic weight in metals and suggest a difference in molecular weight between two forms of phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
