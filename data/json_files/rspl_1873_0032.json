The study confirms that there is a localization of function in specific regions of the cerebral hemispheres, with centers for carrying out simple and complex muscular movements and sensory perception. The research provides a foundation for understanding the anatomical homology of the brain and the division of sensory and motor regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
