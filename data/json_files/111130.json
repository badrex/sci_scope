Sabine investigates the mean effects of larger magnetic disturbances and discovers periodical laws in the occurrence and effects of these disturbances. The study reveals a connection between the disturbances, seasons of the year, and hours of the day at specific stations. This research has implications for understanding the physical causes of periodical variations in terrestrial magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
