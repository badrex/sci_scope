They conclude that the comet did not pass near the star in the left ear of Aries, as claimed by Hevelius, but rather near the bright star in its left horn according to Bayer's tables. The observations of other astronomers, including French, Italian, and Dutch, support this conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Comet Observation and Analysis"}
