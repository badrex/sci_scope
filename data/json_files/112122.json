The study suggests that the Sun's radiation and heat are the source of all energy in the solar system, and that the Sun's density and composition indicate a combination of both ponderable and imponderable matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
