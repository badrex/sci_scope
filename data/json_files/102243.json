He suggests that chyle is highly impregnated with urinous salt, which causes its whiteness. After entering the arteries, chyle loses its salt and becomes lympha, which continues to circulate throughout the body. Lympha helps dilute the blood and is essential for maintaining proper blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Anatomy"}
