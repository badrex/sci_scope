They discover that a muscular mechanism, consisting of a sheet of longitudinally coursing fibers, plays a significant role in the closure of the valves, working in conjunction with eddies and currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cardiology & Cardiovascular System"}
