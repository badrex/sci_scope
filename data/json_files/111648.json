The device uses a vertical and horizontal tube filled with mercury and spirits of wine, respectively, and features two magnetic indices to record maximum and minimum temperatures. This instrument provides a reliable method for measuring temperature changes and can be used as a wet-bulb thermometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
