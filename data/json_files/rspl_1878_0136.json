The study also reveals that the olfactory nerve is a primary nerve, comparable to segmental cranial nerves, and that the olfactory tract and bulb do not appear until a late stage of development, providing no grounds for separating the olfactory nerve from other cranial nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Developmental Biology"}
