The volatile alcali is found to be the basis of putrefaction, and its presence is essential to the process. The author also suggests that volatile alcali may be present in living bodies but cannot be used as antiseptics due to its stimulating quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Analysis"}
