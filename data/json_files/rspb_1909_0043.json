The results show that the germinating power and enzyme activity decrease over time, with seeds from drier climates retaining their germination capacity for longer. The presence of diastase ferment in resting seeds is also confirmed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
