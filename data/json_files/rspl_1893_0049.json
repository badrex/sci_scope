The study shows that larvae fed with green leaves or etiolated leaves develop green or brown colors, while those fed with white mid-ribs of cabbage lack these pigments and cannot form the ground color. This supports the theory that some colors in these larvae are derived from modified chlorophyll and etiolin from their food plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Insect Biology"}
