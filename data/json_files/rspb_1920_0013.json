The research focuses on the development of the pharynx, the vascular system, and the inner ear, providing a detailed account of the process and findings. The study confirms the primitive nature of the reptile and its unique features, such as the persistence of the arteria stapedialis and the presence of a number of newly-identified branches of this artery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
