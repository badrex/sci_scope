The device uses a concave metal speculum and an oval plane to focus light, allowing for improved magnification and clarity. This innovative design offers a new approach to telescope construction and has the potential to revolutionize the field of astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Astronomy"}
