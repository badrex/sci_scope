The experiments reveal that gold alloyed with silver and copper is ideal for coinage due to maintaining color and ductility. The specific gravity of gold alloys varies depending on the type and proportion of the added metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
