They find that exposure to abnormal temperatures during impregnation and development can lead to significant size variations in the larvae, with the degree of reaction diminishing over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Developmental Biology & Embryology"}
