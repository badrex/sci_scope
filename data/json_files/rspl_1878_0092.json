They find that the water has a low specific gravity and temperature, and the ice has a disturbed proportion of chlorides and sulfates. The author also examines the structure of the ice, noting its horizontal stratification and the varying salinity levels within it.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Glaciology"}
