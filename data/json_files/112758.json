The authors found that the mean chemical intensity of total daylight at hours equidistant from noon remains the same. They also discovered that the relation between the total chemical intensity and solar altitude is represented by a straight line for altitudes above 10\u00b0. The variation in the direction of the straight line is due to the opalescence of the atmosphere, and the higher intensity is found where the mean temperature of the air is greater.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science"}
