He also observes that the electricity in mines is not influenced by the presence of workmen, candles, or explosions. Fox's experiments lead him to propose a connection between heat, electricity, magnetism, and the arrangement of veins in the earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Mineralogy"}
