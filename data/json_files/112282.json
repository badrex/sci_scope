The study reveals a significant relationship between air temperature and daily urea excretion, with a decrease in excretion at temperatures above 76\u00b0F, marking the physiological limit of the tropical zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Pathophysiology"}
