The researchers found that gluten's cohesion and tenacity are influenced by the presence of acids and electrolytes, which can either disperse or maintain the gluten's structure. The findings provide insight into the properties of gluten and its role in dough formation and bread-making.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Molecular Biology"}
