Halley discusses the use of cross hairs in a telescope for observing celestial objects and improving the accuracy of their positions. He demonstrates the effectiveness of this method by observing the positions of stars near Mars' future opposition and confirms the accuracy of his findings by comparing them with Mercury's position.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics"}
