The observations were conducted to better understand tidal phenomena and improve tidal predictions. The author concludes that while there are local irregularities, there are no general irregularities affecting tides along extensive coastlines, which could aid in making more accurate tidal predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
