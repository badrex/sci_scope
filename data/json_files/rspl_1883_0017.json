They also observe that the intensity of the banded absorptions varies with temperature and suggest that suspended water stuff in the atmosphere may be responsible for the blue color of the sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
