They find that while some plants show a correlation between cell size and chromosome number, others do not, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Genomics"}
