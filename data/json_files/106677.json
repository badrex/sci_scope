He finds that the acid produced from the reaction of dephlogisticated and inflammable air is not solely due to the presence of phlogisticated air, and that the acid is a necessary result of the union of these two types of air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
