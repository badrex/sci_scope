Leibnitz presents a new method for creating precise portable watches that relies on a mechanical reflection rather than the equal duration of unequal vibrations of pendulums or springs. The design involves two springs working alternately, ensuring a uniform play that continues without interruption.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Design"}
