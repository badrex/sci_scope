The study finds that an increase in light, particularly violet and blue light, promotes animal combustion, while an increase in temperature tends to reduce it. However, the combined action of heat and light remains unclear, and further experiments are needed to understand the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Metabolism"}
