The study aims to determine the degree of accuracy with which local races of the species adjust to their environment and the frequency of deviations from the average size and shape of the organs. The results support the prediction that natural selection does not alter the law governing the frequency of deviations from the average size, suggesting that the law of error applies to all cases, regardless of the influence of natural selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Evolutionary Biology & Ecology"}
