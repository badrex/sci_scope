The research focuses on nitrate of potassa, chloride of potassium, chlorate of potassa, and other related salts. The study supports Dr. Turner's views and refutes the hypothesis that all equivalent numbers are simple multiples of hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
