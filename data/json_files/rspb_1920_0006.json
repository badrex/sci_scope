They find that spermatozoa movement and agglutination are affected by the concentration of hydrogen ions and trivalent ions in the surrounding medium, and that these effects can be reversed by sodium citrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproductive Biology & Physiology"}
