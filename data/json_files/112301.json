The author analyzes the data from various magnetometers and describes the changes in declination, horizontal force, and vertical force over time. The findings reveal a significant change in the magnetism during the period 1848-1857, suggesting a possible connection to the Earth's interaction with the Sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
