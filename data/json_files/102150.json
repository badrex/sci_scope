B. describes a new type of carriage, the Calesh, which has two wheels and improved stability. It is easier to maneuver than a common coach and can handle uneven terrain. The inventor, who has improved the design since his time in London, demonstrates the Calesh's capabilities by running experiments on various terrains and even overturning it multiple times without causing harm to the rider or the horse.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Vehicle Design"}
