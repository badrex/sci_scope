The author discusses the possible connection between the phenomenon described in the paper and the formation of double stars, planets, and satellites. Despite M. Poincare's warning about applying these results to heterogeneous masses and cosmogony, the author cannot resist exploring this connection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Celestial Mechanics"}
