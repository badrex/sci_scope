They find that the growth of corpora lutea in the ovaries is functionally correlated with mammary gland hypertrophy, and that the uterus is not a necessary factor in the development of the mammary gland. The study also explores the influence of experimentally produced corpora lutea on the uterus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproductive Biology & Endocrinology"}
