They find that despite significant damage to the occipital lobe, vision remains unaffected, while damage to the prefrontal regions leads to a change in the animal's behavior and mental state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurology"}
