Norman Lockyer, investigates the widening of iron lines and unknown lines in sunspot spectra over the period of 1879-1894. He finds that the phenomena observed during the sunspot minimum and maximum periods are reproducible and supports the hypothesis that the change in iron lines is due to the dissociation of iron in the spots as a sunspot maximum is approached.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Solar Spectroscopy"}
