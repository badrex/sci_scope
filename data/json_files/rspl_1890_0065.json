They determine the boiling point of sulphur and provide a detailed description of the apparatus and method used. The results show that the method is accurate and can be used to standardize thermometers for temperature measurements between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
