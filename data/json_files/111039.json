He deduces a general system of equations to determine the motion of any number of spheres based on the distance function and their masses and mutual distances. Smythies also explores the physical impossibility of an exact universal law and suggests a method of unlimited approximation for any unknown law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mathematical Physics & Gravitation"}
