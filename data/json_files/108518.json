The research involves the study of fetal pigs, calves, lambs, goats, rabbits, rats, and human embryos, and the findings suggest that the nuclei in the muscle fibers are not contained within cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
