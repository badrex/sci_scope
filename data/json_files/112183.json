The results show that the expansion of water between 4\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C can be expressed by a formula, and the coefficient of expansion of mercury is closely in agreement with Regnault's findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
