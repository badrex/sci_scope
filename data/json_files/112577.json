Using Regnault's Table of the absolute dilatation of mercury and Despretz's Table of the absolute dilatation of water, Stewart determines the specific gravity of mercury at various temperatures, finding that it is approximately 13.6.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics"}
