He conducts experiments using a rotating wheel to observe the effects of motion on seed germination, concluding that gravitation is the primary force influencing the direction of radicle and germination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
