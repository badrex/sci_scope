The experiments reveal that starch is formed in the leaves of green plants when supplied with glucose, saccharon, mannite, inulin, and glycerin, but not from other compounds like raffinose, inosite, erythrite, dulcite, and trioxy-methylene.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
