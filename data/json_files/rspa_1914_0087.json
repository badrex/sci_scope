The authors discover that alloys containing up to 5% aluminium form uniform solid solutions, and that a eutectoid point exists at 524\u00b0C. They also observe a remarkable recalescence phenomenon, where the alloys undergo a structural change due to a reaction between their components, and propose that the new substance formed is the compound Au4Al.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
