The authors found that stretching the wires caused a temporary alteration in specific resistance, but no permanent changes unless there was permanent stretching. The results suggest that mechanical treatment does not significantly affect the electrical properties of the tested metals, unlike the impact of impurities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Properties of Materials"}
