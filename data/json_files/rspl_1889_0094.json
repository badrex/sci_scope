They identify the ophthalmicus profundus, trigeminus, facial complex, glossopharyngeus, and vagus complex, as well as the electric nerves that supply the electric organ. The study provides insights into the nervous system of elasmobranch fishes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Zoology"}
