They find that the size of the crystals of the depolarizer is crucial for the cell's efficiency, and recommend a specific method of preparation. The authors also test the recuperative power of the cadmium cell and its temperature coefficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
