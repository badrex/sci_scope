These enhanced lines are found in the spectra of hotter stars and the solar chromosphere. The study reveals that the chromosphere has a higher temperature and a simplified spectrum compared to cooler regions where Fraunhofer absorption occurs.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
