The experiments reveal that the spinal cord broadens in areas where currents were passed longitudinally and narrows where transverse currents were applied. The study suggests that contractions, such as those produced by electricity, may occur during life under the effect of nervous shock and could be phenomena causal or associated with disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
