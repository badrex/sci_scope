They demonstrate that these lines, when extended, form curves of double curvature on a sphere and describe a conical surface with unique properties. The author also discusses the differences in the number of undulations present in these curves and how they can be represented geometrically.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
