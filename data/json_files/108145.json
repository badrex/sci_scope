James Farquharson, describes a remarkable appearance of the Aurora Borealis below clouds, observed on February 24, 1842. The phenomenon was seen between the observer and lofty stratus clouds, with a gentle wind at N.W. The display consisted of pencils of aurora, or streamers, with varying colors and densities, crossing the clouds and extending into the clear sky. The observation continued until dense clouds obscured the view, and the phenomenon was not seen again in the same spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
