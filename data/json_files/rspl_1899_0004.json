The authors observe the formation of slip bands on the surface of strained metals, which they attribute to slips along cleavage or gliding planes. These slip bands change the appearance of the metal surface and provide insight into the deformation process of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Metallurgy & Materials Science"}
