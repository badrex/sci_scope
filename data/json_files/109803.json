He also explores the elliptic representations of circles on a plane surface using perspective. The paper focuses on the positions of the axes of the representing ellipses and their practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geometry & Topology"}
