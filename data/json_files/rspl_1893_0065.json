It also examines ovulation, concluding that ovulation does not necessarily occur during each menstrual period and that menstruation is not caused by ovulation. The research suggests that the function of menstruation may be to prepare the mucosa for the reception and retention of an ovum, while the degeneration period represents the result of failed fertilization or ovulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Development"}
