They compare the friction of the sea on its bottom to the friction of the wind on the ground and develop a formula to estimate the energy dissipated by tidal friction. The study provides a more accurate estimate of energy dissipation than previous methods, taking into account the varying nature of the sea's bottom and the effects of scale on friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Coastal Studies"}
