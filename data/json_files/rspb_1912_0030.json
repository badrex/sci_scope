The test is effective in detecting both complete and partial cases of red-blindness and green-blindness, and can be easily adapted to create different designs for testing various color sensitivities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Sensory Systems"}
