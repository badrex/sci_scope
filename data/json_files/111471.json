It also covers the harmonic relation, involution, and homography in the context of bipartite binary quadrics. The author presents expressions for the linear factors of these quantics and discusses their determination.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Geometry"}
