He finds that the spleen becomes distended and colored when the stomach contains fluids, suggesting that it plays a role in the absorption of fluids from the stomach. The study also shows that the spleen's absorption of rhubarb coloring matter does not occur through the ordinary circulation, but rather through a direct connection between the stomach and the spleen.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Gastroenterology & Hepatology"}
