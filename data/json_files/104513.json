The lectures cover the structure of muscular fibers, the interplay of interstitial air and nervous-muscular systems, and the circulation of blood in animal vessels. The author also considers the animal body as a machine with two interconnected systems, the lacteals, blood vessels, and lymphatics, and the nervous and muscular systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Anatomy"}
