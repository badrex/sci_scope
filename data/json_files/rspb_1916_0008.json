They find that chloramines have a higher germicidal action than hypochlorites and are not protein coagulants, making them suitable for practical use. Toluene sodium sulphochloramide, in particular, shows promise as a valuable antiseptic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
