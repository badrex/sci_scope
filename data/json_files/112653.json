He demonstrates that an electro-magnet can become a powerful magnet by the gradually increasing currents it generates, leading to a greater magnetic force and increased effects on surrounding materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
