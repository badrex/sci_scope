It presents a general theory for the case when differential coefficients are given explicitly in terms of variables and extends it to the case when they are given implicitly. The paper also discusses the application of the theory to various examples, such as lines in two osculating planes, congruency of common tangents to quadric surfaces, and inflexional tangents to a surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analysis & Geometry"}
