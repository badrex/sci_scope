The authors conduct experiments to determine if the change of length in a nickel wire when placed in a magnetic field can be explained by the stresses resulting from magnetization. They compare their experimental results with the theoretical predictions and find that the theory only accounts for a part of the observed contraction, suggesting further research is needed to fully understand the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics"}
