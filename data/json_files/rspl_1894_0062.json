The authors conclude that sounds are produced by the vibration of air within the air-bladder, rather than the expulsion of air through the ductus pneumaticus, and that the 'elastic spring' mechanism and paired extrinsic muscles are structures subordinate to sound production.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Ichthyology"}
