The author observes the transformation of the larva into a Crinoid and describes the morphological and physiological relations of the larval zooid, proposing the term 'pseudembryo' for these independently organized zooids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Developmental Biology"}
