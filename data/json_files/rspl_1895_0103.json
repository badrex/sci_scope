Runge and Paschen's Diffusion Experiment", "topics": ["Chemistry", "Spectroscopy", "Gas Chemistry", "Diffusion", "Uraninite"], "tldr": "The author conducts experiments to determine the density of gases obtained from cleveite and uraninite, challenging the previous findings of Messrs. Runge and Paschen. The results support the conclusion that the gas giving the line D3 is lighter than the gas giving the line 5015.7, which is crucial for stellar classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
