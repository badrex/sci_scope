The results show that the mean annual difference is greatest at Kew, with annual ranges reaching a maximum in December and a minimum in August. The study also reveals that sudden temperature rises are more frequent and of greater magnitude than sudden falls in these islands.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
