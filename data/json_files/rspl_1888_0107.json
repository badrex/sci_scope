The study provides a detailed analysis of various observations made by other researchers and concludes with a mean value of the wave-length of the principal line in the Aurora spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
