The author finds that exposure to light decreases the resistance of selenium, and that the action is primarily due to the illuminating power of the light. The sensitivity of selenium to light increases with time spent in the dark, and the yellowish-green rays appear to be the most effective in altering the electrical state of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Optics"}
