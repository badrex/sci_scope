The study focuses on the process of fertilization, the role of spermatozoon, and the development of the embryo from the ovum. The findings reveal the importance of specific segments of the ovum in the formation of different parts of the embryo, including the head, trunk, and tail.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Developmental Biology"}
