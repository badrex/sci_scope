Waterston, provides evidence of a difference between the readings of mercurial and air-thermometers between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. He uses observations on the tension of low-pressure steam to demonstrate this difference and suggests a formula to correct for it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
