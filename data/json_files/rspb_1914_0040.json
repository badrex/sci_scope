The study suggests that these plants' evolution was not in response to different conditions, and there may be no selection of infinitesimal variations, but rather progress through mutations or fixed changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Botany & Plant Science"}
