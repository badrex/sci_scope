He examines the effects of lunar declination and the moon's parallax on tidal heights and discusses the diurnal inequality in the height of high water. Lubbock also explores the relationship between the epoch of the semidiurnal inequality and the changes in height of the land above the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Hydrology"}
