The study employs methods that measure conductivity variation and the similarities between mechanical and radiation strains, providing evidence for the fundamental unity of effects caused by visible and invisible radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Phenomena"}
