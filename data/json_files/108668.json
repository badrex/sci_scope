The author investigates the resistance of tubes to collapse and finds that tube length significantly affects their strength. The findings contribute to the improvement of boiler construction and safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science"}
