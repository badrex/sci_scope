He explains the process of determining symmetric functions and the resultant of a system of equations, and applies this to two specific cases: a linear equation and a quadratic equation, and a linear equation and a cubic equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
