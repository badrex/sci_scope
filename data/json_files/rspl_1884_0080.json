The hypothesis suggests that energy is transferred through the medium, moving perpendicularly to the plane containing electric and magnetic intensity lines, and that it comes into the conductor from the surrounding insulator rather than flowing along the wire.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
