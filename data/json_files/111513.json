The research finds that the refractive index diminishes as temperature increases, and the sensitivity to temperature varies among substances. The length of the spectrum also changes with temperature, and the dispersive power can be either diminished or augmented by a rise in temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
