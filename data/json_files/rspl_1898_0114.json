They find that the efficiency of the human body, or the economic coefficient of the human machine, is lower than previously thought, with an average of 102.26 calories per hour emitted during rest.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physiology & Biophysics"}
