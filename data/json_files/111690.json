The nerves never penetrate the sarcolemma, and they run alongside smaller arteries and capillary vessels. The research also highlights the role of oval bodies or nuclei in the nervous phenomena and the development of new fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
