The author examines the role of gland-cells, the structure of the tentacles, and the cellular responses to various stimuli, such as heat, moisture, and food, providing insights into the plant's feeding and trapping mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
