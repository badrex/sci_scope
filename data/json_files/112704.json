The research suggests that the distinction between Dolichocephali and Brachycephali should be based on various characters, rather than just the cephalic index, and proposes new subdivisions for certain skull types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anthropology & Human Evolution"}
