The results suggest that adrenine has a motor effect on both organs, indicating a motor quality in the sympathetic nerve supply of the non-pregnant human uterus. Pituitrin stimulates the contraction of the uterus but has no significant effect on the Fallopian tube.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Obstetrics & Gynecology"}
