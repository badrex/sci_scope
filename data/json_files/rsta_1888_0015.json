The author presents a complete set of invariants and covariants, proving their functional completeness and providing methods for constructing and analyzing these functions. The article also discusses transformations of linear differential equations and their implications on the equations' invariants and covariants.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Differential Equations & Analysis"}
