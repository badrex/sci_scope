G. Unwin investigates the friction of water against solid surfaces of varying degrees of roughness. He finds that the resistance to fluid motion varies as the square of the velocity and is significantly affected by surface roughness, chamber size, and water temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Hydraulics"}
