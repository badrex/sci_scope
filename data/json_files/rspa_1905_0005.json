They find that years with high atmospheric pressure correspond to deficient Nile floods, while years with low atmospheric pressure correspond to high floods and heavier rainfall in Abyssinia. This study suggests that meteorological conditions in North-East Africa have a significant impact on the Nile flood.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climate"}
