The disturbance was the largest of the year, with notable differences in the changes recorded at the two observatories. The study focuses on the oscillations with periods of about 20 minutes and their correlation with the magnetic field measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetosphere"}
