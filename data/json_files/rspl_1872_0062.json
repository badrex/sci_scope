They also provide a summary of similar observations made by W.P. King in 1867 and 1868. The results show that the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units is a velocity, which is crucial in the electromagnetic theory of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
