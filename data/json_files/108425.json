He finds that the intensity of solvent attraction plays a significant role in solubility and that the diffusion process can be influenced by the density of the solution and the presence of other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Solution Thermodynamics"}
