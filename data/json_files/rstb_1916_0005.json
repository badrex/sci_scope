They explore the effects of varying atmospheric conditions, wind velocity, and barometric pressure on the rate of cooling and evaporation, providing a method to measure the relative rates of heat loss under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
