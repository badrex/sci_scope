He introduces the concept of matrices, their addition, multiplication, and the formation of powers and functions. Cayley also discusses the theorem that any matrix satisfies an algebraic equation of its own order and its applications, including finding the general expression of matrices convertible with a given matrix.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory"}
