The authors argue for the existence of a separate system of tubes, distinct from the blood-vascular system, which spreads throughout the foot and is connected to the reproductive organs. They provide evidence through various experiments and injections, challenging previous theories and hypotheses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
