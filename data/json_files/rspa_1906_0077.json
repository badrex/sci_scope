They find that the results do not support the theories of de Heen and Traube, and instead support the views of Young and others. The experiments also reveal an opalescent band at the critical temperature, which calls for further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
