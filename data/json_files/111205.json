{"article_id": "111205", "revised_title": "On the Theory of Waves: Analyzing Wave Motion and Oscillating Waves", "topics": ["Hydrodynamics", "Wave Theory", "Fluid Mechanics", "Oscillating Waves", "Wave Propagation"], "tldr": "The author investigates wave motion and oscillating waves, analyzing the velocity of transmission, the horizontal motion of particles, and the length of waves. He also examines the differences between positive and negative waves and the limitations of previous theories. The study has implications for understanding wave behavior in rivers and hydraulic engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Hydrology & Oceanography"}
