The author investigates the skin and motor distribution of these nerves, as well as the segmental scheme of innervation in the limbs. The research also explores spinal reflex action and its implications for understanding the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
