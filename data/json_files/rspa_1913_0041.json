The results show that as the concentration of the acid increases, the rotatory power of the sugars also increases, suggesting that acids play a significant role in altering the optical properties of these sugars.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
