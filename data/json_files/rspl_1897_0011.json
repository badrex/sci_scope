The results show that the green light is the most potent in the dark-adapted eye, while the yellow is the most potent in the light-adapted eye. The findings suggest that the eye's adaptation to light or dark conditions significantly impacts the perceived potency of different colors in the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
