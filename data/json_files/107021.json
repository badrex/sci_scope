The study reveals that the retina is transparent during life, and the optic nerve has a semi-transparent internal structure. The findings challenge previous theories on nerve structure and contribute to the understanding of the eye's luminous appearance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Anatomy"}
