They explore various types of toroidal functions, including zonal, tesseral, and those suitable for toroids without a central opening, and provide examples of their applications in physics and engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics"}
