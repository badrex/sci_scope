He observes that the heat of the water from the common pump of the king's bath is higher than the cross bath, and compares the cooling rates of bath and common water. He also measures the heat of the hot-well near Bristol.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geothermal Energy & Hydrothermal Systems"}
