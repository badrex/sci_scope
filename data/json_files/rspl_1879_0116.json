They argue that the presence of phosphoric acid weakens the intensity of the potassium spectrum, and that spectroscopic methods are not reliable for quantitative comparison of potassium in different samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
