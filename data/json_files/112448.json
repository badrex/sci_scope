W. Sidgreaves, using instruments from Stonyhurst Observatory. They collected data on dip, declination, and horizontal intensity at various stations, and provide maps of isodynamic, isoclinal, and isogonic lines. The study also discusses the secular variation and magnetic disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
