He observes that the motion in summer exceeds that in winter, especially at lower elevations, and concludes that glaciers are not rigidly solid bodies but rather act as ductile or plastic materials under fluid pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology"}
