They find that the detonating stage (explosive wave) is always preceded by vibratory movements and that the whole column of unignited gas is induced into an altered condition, allowing for a more rapid chemical reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
