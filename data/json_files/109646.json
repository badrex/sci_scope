The device consists of two tubes and a glass cylinder, allowing for precise measurements of gas contraction. Pepys demonstrates the eudiometer's effectiveness with various gases, including nitrous gas, oxygen gas, atmospheric air, carbonic gas, and sulphuretted hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Instrumentation"}
