The authors propose a new nomenclature for the Weberian ossicles to avoid confusion with mammalian auditory ossicles and provide a comprehensive overview of the structures and their functions in the Siluridae family.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Ichthyology"}
