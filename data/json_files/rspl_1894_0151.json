Olszewski and Professor William Ramsay investigate the liquefaction and solidification of argon, discovering its critical pressure, critical temperature, boiling point, and melting point. Argon is found to be the fourth easiest to liquefy among the so-called 'permanent' gases and has a higher density than oxygen, leading to its unique solidifiable properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry"}
