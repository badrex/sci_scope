He explains the processes through which family peculiarities of stature gradually diminish, eventually becoming indistinguishable from a random group of people. The study focuses on the ease of measuring and the constancy of stature during adulthood, making it an excellent subject for hereditary inquiry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Biology & Genetics"}
