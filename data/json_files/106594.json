He concludes that the deflagration produces a quantity of water equal in weight to the airs, suggesting that water may be composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of their latent heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Reactions & Bonding"}
