He concludes that the alburnous tubes are not the primary pathway for sap ascent, but rather serve as reservoirs for fluid secreted by the bark. Knight proposes that the cellular substance is the main conduit for sap movement, and that its organization allows for efficient upward flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
