The technique involves using a camphine lamp with a specific design to provide sufficient artificial light, and a sensitive photographic paper prepared with bromide of silver and iodide of silver. The paper is then developed to capture the variations, providing a continuous register of the instruments' movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
