Fowler and H. L. Callendar, report the discovery of a new series of lines in the spectrum of magnesium. These lines, which were previously unnoticed, are associated with the well-known series described by Rydberg. The authors use various formulas to analyze the new series and conclude that the magnesium arc spectrum includes two subordinate series in addition to the two well-known subordinate series of triplets.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
