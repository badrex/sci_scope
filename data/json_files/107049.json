He also discusses the velocity of sound, sonorous cavities, and the decay of sound. Young's experiments and observations contribute to the understanding of acoustics, fluid dynamics, and the wave theory of light and sound.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Acoustics & Optics"}
