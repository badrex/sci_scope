He presents evidence of specimens found in Portpatrick and discusses their method of consuming and destroying timber. Additionally, he describes the Limnoria terebrans, another crustacean that causes extensive damage to wood, often working alongside the Teredo navalis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
