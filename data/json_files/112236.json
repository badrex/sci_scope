They demonstrate that catalytic decomposition can be seen as a combination of these two actions, with oxidation and reduction occurring simultaneously. The study also shows that in many cases, catalytic change is brought about by intermediate compounds that are formed and destroyed during the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
