They find that the laws regulating the effects of stimuli on the brain and spinal cord on voluntary and involuntary muscles are different, and that chemical stimuli applied to the nervous system can affect the heart's action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
