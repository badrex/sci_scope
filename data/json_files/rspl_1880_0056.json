They use an incandescent electric light source and various fluids to study the absorption spectra, concluding that each radical has a definite absorption in the infra-red and can be detected in a more complex body.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
