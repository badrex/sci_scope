He develops a new instrument to measure the conductivity of various types of wood and establishes that wood has three unequal axes of calorific conduction. These findings have implications for understanding the properties of other organic structures and their potential impact on climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geology"}
