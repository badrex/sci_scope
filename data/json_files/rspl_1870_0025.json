The author discusses the role of geological disturbances and denudation in shaping the current coal field boundaries and suggests that the tendency of coal fields to form 'basins' is due to the intersection of two systems of flexures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
