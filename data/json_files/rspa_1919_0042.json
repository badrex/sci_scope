They observe that the higher members of the series are fainter and more difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, which is consistent with Bohr's theory of atomic structure. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen atoms emitting lines of the higher members of the Balmer series and their visibility under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Molecular Physics"}
