He also creates dephlogisticated air, which is five to six times better than common air for respiration, inflammation, and other uses. Priestley explains his experiments and findings, including the production of these airs and their properties, as well as his thoughts on the phlogiston theory and the composition of common air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical & Physical Chemistry"}
