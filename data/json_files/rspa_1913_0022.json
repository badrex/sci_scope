They find that the ionization due to \u03b2-rays is 10 times greater than the ionization due to \u03b1-rays, suggesting that the \u03b2-rays are excited by the \u03b1-rays themselves or by the surrounding thorium atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nuclear Physics & Radioactivity"}
