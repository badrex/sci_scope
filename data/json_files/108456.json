The presence of albumen, fibrin, and blood-globules in the urine is not due to an accumulation of fat in the blood, but rather a result of the kidney's filtration process being affected by the circulation of blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Nephrology & Urology"}
