He finds that metals, contrary to previous beliefs, have little attraction for the electric fluid and are passive during its transit. Ritchie also observes that heat increases the conducting powers of materials, including metals and rarefied air in flames and volcanic eruptions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electricity"}
