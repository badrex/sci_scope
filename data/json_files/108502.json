They identify a new substance called excretine, which is found in human feces and can be obtained through a specific method of analysis. Excretine is soluble in ether and hot alcohol, but insoluble in water, and has potential implications for understanding the digestive system and the effects of different diets.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
