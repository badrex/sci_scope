The process involves concentration, precipitation, and decomposition of the lead-compound of the colloid acid. The atomic weight and composition of the acid are determined through the analysis of its insoluble lead-salt and baryta-salt.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
