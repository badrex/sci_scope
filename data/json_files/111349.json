The author compares the Scelidothere's anatomy to other large extinct animals, particularly those in the Edentate order, and discusses its size, limb structure, and probable diet. The study contributes to our understanding of the Megatherioid animals and their distinctive characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
