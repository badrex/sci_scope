Blanford, investigates the origin of a cyclone by analyzing barometric pressures, temperatures, and wind patterns in the Bay of Bengal during the week leading up to the Calcutta storm of November 1, 1867. He concludes that the storm was generated by a combination of wind currents and atmospheric conditions, including a region of barometric depression between latitudes 4\u00b0 and 6\u00b030' N.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
