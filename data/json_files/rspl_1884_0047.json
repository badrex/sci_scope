The device can be used to test light of different intensities and determine the candle-power of a luminous source. The study also reveals that the pupil has a range of its own in different individuals, but the ratios of the pupil's size to light intensity remain consistent.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
