This method allows for regular meteorological registration and can be carried out without regard to wind or weather. The author demonstrates the accuracy and trustworthiness of the method through various experiments and observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Photochemistry & Photophysics"}
