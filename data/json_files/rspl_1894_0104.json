The authors found that the potential difference between points 4 ft. apart on the surface was over 20% of the total potential difference used to charge the pipe. The results highlight the potential dangers of electrical energy supply and the importance of proper insulation and grounding.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical Engineering & Power Systems"}
