Through a series of experiments, he determines that the weight gain is not due to the presence of phlogiston but rather the interaction of the metal with the acid, alkali, or water used during the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Materials"}
