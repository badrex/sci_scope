They find that shallow breathing results in lower oxygen saturation, while deep breathing increases oxygen saturation in the blood. The results suggest that the arterial blood is not fully saturated with oxygen during shallow breathing and resting.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Respiratory System & Pulmonology"}
