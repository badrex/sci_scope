The membrana tympani is found to be larger and thicker in elephants compared to humans, with distinct muscular fibers visible in both species. The author also discusses the vascularity and attachment of the membrana tympani to the bones in the ear, as well as the role of muscles in adapting the membrane to different sounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Physiology"}
