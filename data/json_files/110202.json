He argues that these quantities, though sometimes considered 'impossible,' can be real and significant in certain cases. Warren also establishes a necessary connection between algebra and geometry, and suggests that a true theory of negative and imaginary quantities will be useful in solving dynamics problems within a single plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mathematical Analysis & Foundations"}
