The device consists of three glass vessels, allowing for the separation and absorption of fixed air into water. This method can be used for various chemical and pharmaceutical experiments, including mimicking mineral waters and dissolving previously insoluble substances in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Techniques & Instrumentation"}
