The new design allows for greater accuracy in measuring altitude by applying an index to a common baroscope, making the variation of the altitude of the mercurial cylinder more distinguishable.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
