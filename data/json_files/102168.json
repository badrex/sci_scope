He observes the living animals in the semen and concludes that the uterus, not the vagina, is responsible for the reception and enclosure of the semen masculum. He also refutes the idea that eggs are sucked from the ovaries in generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Development"}
