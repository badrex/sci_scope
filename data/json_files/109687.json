The instrument uses reflected light to measure small crystal angles with precision, overcoming limitations of traditional goniometers. The author also corrects a previous measurement of the carbonate of lime crystal angle, revising it to 1050 based on his experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Mineralogy"}
