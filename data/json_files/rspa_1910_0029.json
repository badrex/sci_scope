They analyze the properties and molecular volume of the substance, finding it to be a brown powder with a specific gravity of around 1.6, and a molecular volume of 24, which is about 10% greater than the sum of its atomic volumes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
