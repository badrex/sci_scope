The phenomenon of anomalous dispersion is observed at the lines of the principal series and nearby wave-lengths, with the dispersion effects being most noticeable outside the lines forming a pair.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry"}
