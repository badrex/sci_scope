The experiments conducted show that the force increases as the vacuum becomes more absolute, suggesting that the repulsion is indirectly caused by a difference in thermometric heat between the black and white surfaces of the moving body and may be due to a secondary action on the residual gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physics of Radiation & Vacuum"}
