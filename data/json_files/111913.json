They find a lunar-diurnal law of disturbance with a principal maximum 5 hours before the moon's upper meridian passage and a principal minimum near the moon's lower meridian. The study also reveals that the mean lunar disturbance follows a similar law as the mean solar disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
