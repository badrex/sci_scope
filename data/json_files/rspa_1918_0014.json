The study uses impulse theory to analyze the energy distribution and behavior of oscillators, leading to the conclusion that the ultimate kinetic energy of an oscillator with three degrees of freedom is equal to the kinetic energy of a molecule in accordance with the law of radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
