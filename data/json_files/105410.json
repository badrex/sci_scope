The experiments resulted in the congelation of mercury, which was observed to have properties similar to other metals. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of substances at extremely low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Cryogenics"}
