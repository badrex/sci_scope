He examines the silica content in bamboo bark and straw epidermis, and suggests that the silica is organized into a series of cells and tubes. He also discusses the observations of other researchers and proposes to replace the term 'bases' with'skeleton' in the description of vegetable tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Botany"}
