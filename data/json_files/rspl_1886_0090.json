The process involves using potassium permanganate to measure the fractional bleaching caused by the organic matter in a given volume of air. This method provides relative results and can be used for environmental monitoring and air pollution analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Chemistry & Air Pollution"}
