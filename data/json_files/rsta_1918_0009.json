The experimental results support the transverse wave theory and provide evidence against the energy quantum theory. The author also explains the constitution of atoms and the scattering of X-rays by electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Radiation"}
