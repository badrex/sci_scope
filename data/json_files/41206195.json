The experiments reveal that the electric conductivity of magnetized iron is greater across than along the lines of magnetization, and the effect of magnetization increases the resistance relatively in iron squares.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Thermodynamics"}
