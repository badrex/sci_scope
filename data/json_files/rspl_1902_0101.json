The natural cast reveals a unique brain shape, with a broad base and a narrow dorsal surface, while the artificial cast shows more rounded and expanded hemispheres. The author suggests that these differences may indicate a new genus of Archaeoceti or a distinct species within the Zeuglodon genus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Evolutionary Biology"}
