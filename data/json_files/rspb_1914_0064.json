The author conducts experiments with silk and sand, demonstrating that staining occurs independently of the presence of oxygen, challenging the basis of Unna's work on staining and oxidation in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
