The Carlsbad waters show a much quicker dissolution when the calculi are placed in open vessels, allowing the water to flow constantly along them. The author discusses possible reasons for this difference in lithotriptic power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry"}
