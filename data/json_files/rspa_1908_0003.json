They discover that the behavior of these gases is due to their molecular structure and that their conductivity increases with pressure, suggesting that the difference between monatomic and other gases is one of degree.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena"}
