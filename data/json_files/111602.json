He conducts experiments to determine whether sound can reach the labyrinth without the ossicles and whether the chain of ossicles' conformation affects sound transmission. The results support the idea that sound travels through the ossicles to the vestibule and that the stapes can still conduct sound when disconnected from the incus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Systems"}
