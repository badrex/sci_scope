He discusses the formation of peroxides and their properties, as well as the decomposition of these compounds. The author also explores the electrical decomposition of potash and soda, and the properties of pure alkalies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
