They find that the young sexual cells are found in the ectoderm of the coenosarcal canals and that the embryos migrate into the gastrozooid. The study supports the views of Hertwigs and Weismann that the ectoderm is the original seat of sexual cells in Hydrozoa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Invertebrate Biology"}
