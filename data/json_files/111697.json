They found that the direction of polarization was consistent in all cases, with the greatest polarization occurring in the perpendicular plane. The observations also revealed varying degrees of polarization in different instances and provided insights into the optical properties of atmospheric phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
