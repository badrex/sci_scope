The dust resembled lampblack and had a strong sulfur smell. It was followed by rain, and some attributed the event to an eruption of Hecla, a nearby volcano. However, the wind direction did not support this theory, and the dust was not observed in Zetland at its first traveling to the southward.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
