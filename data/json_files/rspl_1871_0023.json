They found that the surface conductivity of the copper ball was relatively constant, regardless of the presence of moisture in the air. The results provide valuable insights into heat transfer and thermoelectricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer"}
