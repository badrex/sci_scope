They find that the corpus luteum maintains its size throughout pregnancy and that the growth changes in the mammary gland are correlated with the further development of corpora lutea. The study also suggests that the myometrial gland, previously thought to play a significant role, does not have a significant function in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Reproduction & Development"}
