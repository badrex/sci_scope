The authors find that the presence of sulphonates affects the activity of the acid, with the potassium salt having a significant impact on the process. The results contribute to the ongoing discussion on the influence of neutral salts in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics"}
