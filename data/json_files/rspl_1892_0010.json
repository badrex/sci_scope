He observes that during sleep, sensory stimuli can cause a slight increase in brain temperature without waking the subject. Mosso also examines the effects of narcotics, anaesthetics, and other factors on brain temperature and concludes that the physical basis of psychical processes is likely chemical action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurophysiology"}
