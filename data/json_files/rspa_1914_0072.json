Instead, the author suggests that a sudden shift in the position of moving images on the retina can enhance brightness and cause intermittences due to increased sensitivity of some rods and cones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Physiology"}
