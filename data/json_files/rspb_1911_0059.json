The researchers found that drinking water contaminated with the feces of goitrous individuals caused 50% of the female goats to develop enlarged thyroid glands. Earthworms were found not to be involved in the spread of goitre.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Endocrinology & Metabolism"}
