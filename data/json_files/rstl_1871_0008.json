They demonstrate that the polarization of mercury can be controlled and used to generate continuous electric currents, potentially providing insights into the source of force in batteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering"}
