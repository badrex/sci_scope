The study reveals that shells are primarily composed of carbonate of lime, while bones contain a larger portion of a more viscous gelatinous substance. The author also discovers that mother of pearl and pearls have a similar composition to shells, with a smaller proportion of carbonate of lime hardened by a membranaceous or cartilaginous substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Materials Science"}
