He also discusses the role of the luminiferous ether in the propagation of light and its refraction, providing a detailed analysis of various phenomena, including the colors of striated surfaces, thin plates, and thick plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
