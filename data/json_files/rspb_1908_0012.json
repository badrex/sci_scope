They find that the starch-grains in F2 hybrid seeds are intermediate between those of round and wrinkled peas, providing insights into the segregation of these traits in subsequent generations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Genetics & Plant Breeding"}
