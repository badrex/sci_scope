The author calculates the viscosity of various glaciers and discusses the factors affecting ice flow, such as temperature, shear stress, and the interaction between ice and rocks. The research also explores the role of optical properties of ice in the deformation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Glaciology & Cryosphere"}
