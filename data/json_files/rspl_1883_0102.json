They also investigate the chemical changes that occur during the electrolysis of copper sulphate and zinc sulphate solutions, concluding that the method cannot accurately determine the presence of hydrated salts in these solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry"}
