He extends the existing theory to include all possible functions that vanish for one or more systems of equalities among the roots and provides distinctive conditions for different systems of equalities in quartic or quintic equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Algebra & Number Theory"}
