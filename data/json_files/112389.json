He discusses their dental characteristics, extinction, and the possibility of other causes for their disappearance besides human intervention. Owen also describes the discovery of a third species, Equus tau, and proposes a new species, Equus arcidens, based on unique dental features.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology"}
