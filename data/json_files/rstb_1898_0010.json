The authors examine the development of ooconia and oospheres, as well as the role of centrospheres and the spindle formation in cell division. They also discuss the importance of collecting and preserving specimens at specific stages of growth for accurate observation and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
