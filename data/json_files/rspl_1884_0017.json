Through a detailed analysis of various specimens, the author concludes that the Edentata are more closely related to the Monotremata than the Marsupialia and that their unique jaw modifications are a result of degenerative specialization. The study also highlights the importance of embryology and comparative anatomy in understanding the evolution of mammalian skulls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Morphology"}
