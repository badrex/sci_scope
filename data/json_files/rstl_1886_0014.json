Abney maps the solar spectrum between wavelengths 7150 and 10,000 using diffraction gratings, providing a more complete and accurate representation of this region than previous maps. The study improves upon the photographic process and discusses the importance of using appropriate apparatus and techniques for accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Solar Physics & Spectroscopy"}
