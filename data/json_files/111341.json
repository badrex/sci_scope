King, conducted experiments to determine the specific gravity of sea-water in various locations during a voyage. He found that the density of ocean water is nearly identical in the Atlantic between 40\u00b0 North and 40\u00b0 South latitude, with exceptions due to local factors. The specific gravity of the South Pacific water between 10\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 is 1026.48, and between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 it is 1026.13.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Oceanography & Marine Chemistry"}
