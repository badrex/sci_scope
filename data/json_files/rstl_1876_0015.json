By analyzing observations from different locations, the author concludes that the sun's rotation and the moon's combined actions are responsible for the observed oscillations in magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetosphere & Geomagnetism"}
