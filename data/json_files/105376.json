He examines the damage caused by lightning to three houses, noting the melting of bell-wires, scorched walls, and burnt objects. He also reports on the effects on people, including a man struck by lightning and a shower of fire-like particles. The author suggests that the particles of the fused wire were actuated by some impellent force, causing the damage and the appearance of a shower of fire.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences"}
