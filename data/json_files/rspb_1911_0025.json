The results show that decapitation causes a significant decrease in carbon dioxide output, which is not due to the abolition of tonus or fall of blood-pressure. The study also indicates that the postural tonus requires very little energy expenditure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
