The study reveals that colorless bodies with equal light-transmitting abilities have varying permeability to chemical rays, and that some materials maintain their diactinic properties in different states (solid, liquid, or gas).", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
