They found no significant evidence of a periodic couple, setting an upper limit on the difference between the gravitational constants for parallel and crossed axes. The experiment also revealed a semi-circular vibration, which may be due to the lack of axial symmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Experimental Physics & Crystallography"}
