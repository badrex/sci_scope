The tusk's size, shape, and structure are analyzed, and microscopical sections of dentinal and cemental portions are examined, revealing characteristic structures of these tissues. The discovery of this tusk suggests the possibility of a wider geographical distribution of the Proboscidian order and a gyrencephalous exception to the characteristic aboriginal Mammalian organization of Australia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mammalogy & Paleontology"}
