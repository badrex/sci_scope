They find that one molecule of rosaniline consumes three equivalents of nitrous acid and produces six equivalents of nitrogen gas. The resulting non-nitrogenous substance is identified as rosolic acid, confirming its chemical and physical properties with those of previously known rosolic acid samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Dyes"}
