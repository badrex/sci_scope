They find that the moment due to wind pressure can be measured by balancing it with the moment of the centrifugal force, providing valuable insights into the behavior of wind pressure on various angles and positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
