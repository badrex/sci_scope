Additionally, the paper presents findings on the ionization of dilute solutions at the freezing point and spectroscopic analysis of the corona, differentiating chromospheric and coronal phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Cell Biology"}
