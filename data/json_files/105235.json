By blowing air through the steam, he increases the steam's strength and reduces fuel consumption. This method also helps maintain a consistent stroke length and water discharge, improving the overall performance of the steam engine.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Mechanical Engineering & Energy"}
