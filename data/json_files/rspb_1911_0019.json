They study the natural history and habits of various biting flies in Uganda, finding that Tabanid flies are abundant in shaded forest areas near water sources. The Commission concludes that Tabanid flies may be common carriers of the disease in Africa, but further research is needed to confirm their role as vectors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Parasitology & Vector Biology"}
