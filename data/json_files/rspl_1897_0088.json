They found that the germinative power of the seeds remained unaffected, suggesting that life in resting seeds is not dependent on respiration and can withstand significant temperature changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Physiology"}
