The rule involves taking the fluxion of the expression, making one variable alone variable, and dividing by that variable. This method can be applied to various types of problems, including those with additional constraints.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Calculus & Analysis"}
