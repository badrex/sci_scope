The research provides detailed information on the arterial supply to various parts of the brain, including the subthalamica, pedunculi, mammillare, and internal capsule. The findings can aid in diagnosing brain softening caused by blocked arteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurology & Neurosurgery"}
