The sponge captures and envelops algal spores, secreting aragonite layers around them, forming a supplementary skeleton. This relationship is considered a true symbiosis rather than parasitism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Marine Biology & Ecology"}
