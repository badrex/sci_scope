The experiment aimed to determine how much astronomical observation could be improved by eliminating the lower part of the atmosphere. The findings could potentially open new avenues in astronomy and related fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Observational Astronomy & Instrumentation"}
