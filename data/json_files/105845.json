The author finds that rainfall decreases as the height increases, with the highest amount of rainfall recorded at ground level. The cause of this difference remains unknown, but the author speculates that it may be related to electrical properties of the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
