The method involves dividing a circle into aliquot parts, marking intervals, and adjusting the microscopes for accuracy. The author provides a detailed example of dividing a two-foot diameter circle into five parts, further dividing each part into smaller intervals.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Instrumentation & Observational Techniques"}
