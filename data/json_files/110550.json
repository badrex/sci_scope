He observes that offspring of trained animals exhibit similar behaviors as their parents, suggesting that these instincts are passed down independently of education. Knight also discusses the influence of male and female parents on their offspring and the potential for hybrid progeny to exhibit traits from one parent over the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ethology & Animal Behavior"}
