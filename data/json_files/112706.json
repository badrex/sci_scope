The genus contains two species and is part of a new family within the Tubulaiidae. These forms were discovered in the lower shales of the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire coal-field and are determined to be parasitic upon Fenestellae. Their discovery brings the order of Tubularine Hydrozoa into geological relation with the Sertularian Graptolites of the Silurian formation and the rare medusoids of the Solenhofen stones.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Paleontology & Stratigraphy"}
