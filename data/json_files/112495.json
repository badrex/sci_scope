The true atomic weight of vanadium is determined to be 51.37, and the correct formula for vanadic acid is V2O5. The author also discovers various vanadium oxides and oxychlorides, and discusses their properties and reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
