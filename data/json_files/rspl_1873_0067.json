They discover that different degrees of dissociating power produce different spectral effects, and that increasing temperature breaks up elemental matter into more complex masses, as observed through the spectroscope.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Elemental Analysis"}
