They find that artificial respiration can keep the heart beating after the brain is removed, but the secretion of urine does not occur. The author also questions the widely held belief that animal heat depends on chemical changes in the blood during respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neurobiology & Physiology"}
