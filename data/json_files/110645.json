He discovers that during the electrolysis of water, a portion of acid passes from the anode to the cathode, and possibly an equal portion of water also passes from the cathode to the anode. This study helps establish the fundamental principle that the force measured by its definite action at one point of a circuit cannot perform more work at another point of the same circuit.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry"}
