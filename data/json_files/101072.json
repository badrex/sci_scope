This material resists fire, water, and air, making it a potential candidate for creating an 'everlasting' book called the 'Book of Eternity.' Further experiments are planned to explore its potential uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Metallurgy"}
