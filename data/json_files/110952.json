Auguste De la Rive, examines the voltaic arc's phenomena and the influence of magnetism on it and conducting bodies transmitting discontinuous electric currents. He observes the transfer of particles, the effects of a powerful electromagnet on the arc, and the emission of sound by conducting bodies under the influence of an electromagnet. The author concludes that these phenomena are molecular and establish principles related to the modification of particle arrangement by electric currents and magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems"}
