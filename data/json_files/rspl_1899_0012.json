They discuss the various observational errors and challenges faced during field work and test the instrument's accuracy by making multiple journeys between Sydney and other locations in Australia. The instrument's ability to measure gravity with an uncertainty of one part in 300,000 demonstrates its potential for use in surveys and further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Measurement & Instrumentation"}
