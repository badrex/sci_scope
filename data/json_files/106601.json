The results show that clear skies contribute to cooler nighttime temperatures, while cloudy skies lead to more uniform temperature readings. The study also highlights the importance of elevation and the influence of the earth's surface on temperature variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
