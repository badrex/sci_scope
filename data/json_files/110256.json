He finds that magnetic intensity experiences sudden and short variations, which are sometimes accompanied by the appearance of the aurora borealis. He also suggests that the fluctuations in the needle's vibrations may be related to atmospheric moisture and changes in wind and snowstorms. Fox hypothesizes that the Earth's magnetism may be derived from electric currents existing both below and above its surface, and that the aurora borealis is an electrical phenomenon that moves from north to south during the night and in the opposite direction during the day.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Magnetism"}
