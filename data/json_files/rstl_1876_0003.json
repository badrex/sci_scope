The findings reveal an annual variation in dip and a steady increase in dip over time, with a probable error in weekly determinations. The study also discusses the impact of the annual variation of the diurnal inequality of dip and the changes in observation location.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
