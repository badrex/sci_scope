By applying high pressure and varying temperatures, Andrews demonstrates that carbonic acid can be partially liquefied, and discusses the implications of this finding on the understanding of phase transitions and the properties of gases and liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
