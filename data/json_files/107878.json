He calculates the rates of the chronometers used at Lignieres and Fairlight, and determines the most probable value of the difference of longitude to be 91\u00b0 2' 1s. This study highlights the importance of accurate timekeeping and precise observations in determining the Earth's meridians.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astronomical Positioning & Navigation"}
