He examines whether this dispersion is due to the separation of light into two distinct species or a simple subdivision, similar to partial reflection. He also explores the laws governing this unique dispersion, which he calls \"epipolic,\" and discovers that once a beam of light has undergone epipolic dispersion, it cannot be dispersed further.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
