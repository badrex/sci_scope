The process involves isolating the liquid oxygen in a properly sealed vessel and lowering the pressure to induce solidification. The resulting solid oxygen can be further studied and manipulated under controlled conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Low Temperature Physics & Cryogenics"}
