The study reveals that these plants have a complex structure, with numerous vascular rings and a combination of Fern and Cycadaceae characteristics. The author also discusses the significance of these findings and the relation of the fossil to Brongniart's genus Colpoxylon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Palaeobotany & Plant Evolution"}
