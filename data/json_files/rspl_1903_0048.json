They observe that certain lines, known as enhanced lines, become more prominent under these conditions, and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the behavior of metallic arcs and their applications in determining relative stellar temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
