He determines that the solar motion holds a middle rank among sidereal velocities and calculates the annual arch of the solar motion to be 1'116992 of a degree. This research provides a link between the principles of solar and sidereal motions and those responsible for orbital motions, opening up new avenues for understanding the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics"}
