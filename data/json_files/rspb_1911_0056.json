The presence of pyrocatechin leads to the oxidation of the plant extracts, enabling the peroxidase enzyme to transfer oxygen to the guaiacum. This research provides insight into the metabolic processes of certain plants and the role of pyrocatechin in their metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Biochemistry"}
