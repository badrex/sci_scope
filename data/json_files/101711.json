He conducts experiments on animal intestines to observe the structure and function of these fibers, providing evidence for the spiral hypothesis and its implications for the peristaltic motion of the intestines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Histology"}
