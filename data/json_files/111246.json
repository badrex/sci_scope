He analyzes six years of hourly observations at Toronto, five years at St. Helena, and five years at Hobarton, finding a lunar diurnal variation in the magnetic declination at each station. The results show that the extreme elongations of the magnetic direction have different values and occur at different times at each station, suggesting a disparity in the lunar influence on the magnetic direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetism & Geomagnetism"}
