Thomson investigates the dissociation of gases, specifically iodine, bromine, chlorine, and nitrogen tetroxide, using electric discharge. He observes significant dissociation in iodine and provides evidence that the dissociation of bromine is less due to the atoms recombining quickly rather than not being dissociated by the spark. The study contributes to the understanding of gas dissociation and the behavior of gases under electric discharge."}
