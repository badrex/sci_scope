The author argues that the molecular formulae for these compounds should be A2Me6 and AlP Et', and that the deviations from theoretical expectations can be explained by decomposition or peculiarities in the constitution of the vapour.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Compounds"}
