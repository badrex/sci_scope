Sherrington investigates the reciprocal innervation of antagonistic muscles and the phenomenon of double reciprocal innervation. He demonstrates that reflex excitation and inhibition can be algebraically summed to produce varying degrees of muscle contraction in both extensor and flexor muscles. This study contributes to the understanding of neural integration and muscle physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Physiology"}
