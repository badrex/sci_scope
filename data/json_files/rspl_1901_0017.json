The authors analyze the chemical composition of various materials involved in the processes and provide insights into the chemistry of the Bessemer process. They also compare the spectra from open-hearth and cupola furnaces, finding that line spectra are not observed in open-hearth flames due to the oxidizing atmosphere of the furnace.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
