He concludes that resins are not a single compound but rather a group of analogous compounds with similar radicals, and that heat causes partial decomposition and changes in atomic constitution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Polymer Science"}
