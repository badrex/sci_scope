The transformation involves heating rosaniline with an excess of aniline or rosaniline salts with salts of aniline, resulting in a blue color. The author also explores the properties and reactions of the newly formed aniline-blue compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Dyes"}
