He concludes that the change in temperature is determined by the nature of the base, not the acid element of the combination. Andrews also discusses the influence of various factors on the experimental results and provides a supplementary note on the determination of the specific heat of fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermal Chemistry & Thermodynamics"}
