Frankland and B.F. Duppa, explore the synthesis of various lactic acid series acids and introduce the oxalyl radical, which they believe is present in nearly every known organic acid. They classify lactic acid series acids into eight divisions based on their structure and discuss their relationship to other organic acids, such as acetic and acrylic acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
