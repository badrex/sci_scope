Observations show that under certain conditions, these brittle, crystalline materials can form a smooth varnish-like covering, smoothing and rounding irregularities. The study also highlights the role of pressure and the seizing of the metal surface in the flow process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
