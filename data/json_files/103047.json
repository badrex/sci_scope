He also compares these phenomena to other historical events, such as the famous meteor observed over Italy in 1676. Halley suggests that these meteors may be collections of matter formed in the ether, which collide with Earth as it moves through its orbit.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth & Environmental Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Atmospheric Science"}
