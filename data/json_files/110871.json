The substance is obtained by distilling a mixture of bran, sulfuric acid, and water. Furfural can be converted into a solid, yellowish-white substance called furfuroamide, and another substance called furine, which has properties of a vegeto-alkali and forms saline compounds with various acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
