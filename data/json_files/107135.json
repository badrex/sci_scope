He discusses the phenomenon of supernumerary rainbows and the similarities between thin film interference and diffraction. Young's findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of light and its interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
