They find that the rate of subsidence decreases with increasing magnetizing force in iron wires and increases initially before decreasing with further increase in magnetizing force in nickel wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials"}
