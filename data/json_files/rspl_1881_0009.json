The lungs are simple sacs without septa, and the nervous system is composed of numerous nerve strands and cells. The author suggests that the non-striped muscle in the lung may be a representative of the muscular tissues found in the alimentary canal.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Anatomy & Developmental Biology"}
