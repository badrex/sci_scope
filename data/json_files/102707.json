Hauksbee conducts an experiment to investigate the production of light by the effluvia of one glass falling on another in motion. He finds that motion is necessary for light production and that the effluvia of glass can act like a solid body. The experiment also suggests that a medium is required in the inward glass to produce light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
