The gas is aromatic, explosive, and reacts with phosphorus but not with other combustible materials. The author suggests that the gas may be a mixture of the new gas and chlorine, but declines to name it until further experiments are conducted.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
