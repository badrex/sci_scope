He proposes that two columns descend from each hemisphere of the cerebrum, one responsible for voluntary motion and the other for sensation. The columns of motion and sensation join and decussate in the medulla oblongata, and the striated septa in the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii play a crucial role in establishing boundaries between these columns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
