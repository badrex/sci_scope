The instrument consists of three thermometers, with the acid spread on the surface of one bulb. The acid's absorption of moisture causes a rise in temperature, which is proportional to the amount of hygrometric moisture absorbed. This method is an alternative to Mason's wet-bulb thermometer and offers advantages such as being frost-free and having a high sensitivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteorology & Climatology"}
