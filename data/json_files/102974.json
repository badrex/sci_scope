He discovered that these insects, particularly small black beetles, create channels in the bark to access the tree's sap, which becomes thick and sweet due to lack of moisture. This attracts more insects, leading to the tree's decline. The study also reveals differences in the insect channels' orientation in elm and ash trees.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Entomology & Ecology"}
