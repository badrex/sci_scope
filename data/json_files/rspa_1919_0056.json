They analyze the adsorption of various gases by cocoanut charcoal and find that the constants A and B are appreciably independent of temperature, indicating that the range of cohesive forces is constant in the studied temperature range.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
