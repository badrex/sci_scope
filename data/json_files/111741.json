The study examines the factors affecting osmotic force, such as the type of solution, concentration, and the chemical properties of the membrane. The author suggests that osmotic force may be a crucial mechanism for obtaining motive power from chemical decomposition in living cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Physiology"}
