He observes that the compass variations are influenced by the ship's direction and offers conjectures on the cause of these differences, which may be related to the ship's ironwork and its position relative to the magnetic equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
