They provide a theoretical construction of the curve using the laws of electromagnetism and compare it to the actual characteristic of the machine, highlighting the errors and assumptions involved in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
