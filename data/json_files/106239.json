The method involves melting the copper and tin together, casting the metal into an ingot, and then melting it again before pouring into molds. This composition and process improve the reflective powers and durability of the speculum.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optical Engineering"}
