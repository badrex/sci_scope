They find that the half-time period of decay is 3.8 days, similar to when the emanation is in air. The results do not definitively support either of the two possible theories regarding the nature of the a-particle, and further experiments are needed to test these theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry"}
