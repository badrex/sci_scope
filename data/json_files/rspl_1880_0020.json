They find that normal urobilin is indistinguishable from choletelin and can be artificially produced from bilirubin, while febrile urobilin is produced through the reduction of choletelin or normal urobilin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Biochemistry & Chemical Biology"}
