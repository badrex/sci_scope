He discovers that the angle of inflection and reflection varies depending on the distance from the body, and that the bending force is inversely proportional to the distance. Brougham also observes that the shadow size and shape change based on the color of light, with red shadows being larger and violet shadows being smaller.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
