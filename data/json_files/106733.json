He uses two identical apparatuses, one with a pasteboard diaphragm and the other with an iron diaphragm, to test the effect of the sun's rays on the materials. The results show that the iron diaphragm generates more heat than the pasteboard diaphragm, indicating that the efficiency of heat production depends on the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer"}
