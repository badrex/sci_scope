Walker presents a train-signalling system that allows disabled trains to telegraph for assistance without portable apparatus. The system uses large electro-magnets, bells, and a simple language of blows to communicate train signals. This innovation provides a means for train guards and plate-layers to express their needs, enhancing railway safety for the traveling public.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Railway & Transportation Engineering"}
