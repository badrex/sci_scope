The study reveals significant differences in the arrangement of the folding of the inner wall of the cerebral hemisphere, the development of the transverse commissural fibers, and the size of the anterior commissure. These differences suggest that the brains of marsupials and monotremes have distinct evolutionary characteristics compared to placental mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Neurobiology"}
