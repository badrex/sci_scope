August Franz details the successful operation and subsequent visual recovery of a young man born blind. The patient's left eye was operated on to remove cataract, and his vision gradually improved over time. He could recognize colors, shapes, and basic forms, but still struggled with depth perception and differentiating between certain hues. The patient's strabismus was also corrected through muscle division, further enhancing his vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine & Health Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Ophthalmology & Optometry"}
