Davy investigates the properties and reactions of iodine and its compounds, particularly the triple compounds. He describes various experiments and observations, including the decomposition of these compounds by heat, their reactions with acids, and the formation of new combinations. Davy also proposes the name 'oxy-iodes' for these triple compounds, as they release oxygen and iodine when decomposed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds"}
