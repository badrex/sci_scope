He observes that foliation often forms great arches with the inclination of layers increasing away from the center, and that this pattern is similar to the arrangement of cleavage planes in slates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geology & Geophysics"}
