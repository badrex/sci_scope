The research uses a bomb calorimeter to measure the heat released and the gases produced during the explosion. The results show that modified cordite has a lower heat of explosion, higher gas volume, and different gas composition compared to the original cordite. The presence of mineral jelly and acetone in both types of cordite is also examined, revealing their impact on the explosion constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Chemical Analysis & Explosives"}
