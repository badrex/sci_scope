They find that while oxalic acid is entirely destroyed by sunlight, oxalates of alkalies do not entirely escape the oxidizing action of sunlight. The study also reveals that the decomposition of potassium iodide in sunlight is due to the oxidation of the alkali metal, suggesting a similar inference in the case of oxalates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials"}
