The authors find that pressure can significantly impact the yield and efficiency of these reactions, with notable results in the formation of calcium carbide and the direct reduction of alumina.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Materials Science"}
