Christie, investigates the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle and proposes a connection between this phenomenon and thermo-magnetism. He conducts experiments using a thermo-magnetic apparatus and concludes that the effect of heating a portion of the plate creates a temporary polarity. The author suggests that the Earth and its atmosphere can be considered a thermo-magnetic combination, with two magnetic poles produced on either side of the equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
