It uses a hydraulic engine with two pallets that move in a circular motion under water, communicating the distance to a dial within the ship. This instrument can also detect the forces of tides and currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering & Technology", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Navigation & Marine Technology"}
