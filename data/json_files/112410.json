Two new bases derived from narcotine are prepared: normal narcotine (nornarcotine) and dimethyl-normal-narcotine (dimethyl-nor-narcotine). The properties and reactions of these bases are compared to other narcotine bases, and neither of the new bases has significant physiological effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry"}
