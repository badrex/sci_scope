The study uses a trichromatic theory to analyze the effects of different colors on the retina and provides insights into the relationship between color perception and retinal fatigue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Sensory Systems"}
