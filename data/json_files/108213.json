He explores the role of the axes of elasticity in the behavior of light and how it affects the criteria for elliptic polarization. Powell also examines the case of elliptically polarized light and the unique methods required to analyze it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
