They demonstrate the method's effectiveness by analyzing the stellar images in the region of the great nebula in Orion, identifying at least ten stars that have changed significantly in brightness within a short interval of five days.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy"}
