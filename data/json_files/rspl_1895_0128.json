They also discuss the challenges of tracing atrophied fascia dentata and circumcallosal convolutions through the indusium griseum, and their potential homology. Additionally, the article mentions a study on cultivating parasitic protozoa from malignant tumors and other tissues, as well as infection experiments and cancer treatment."}
