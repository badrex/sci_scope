The experiment confirms that the mixture of airs is converted into nitrous acid, but the experiment is continued for too long, resulting in a greater quantity of air absorbed and the acid produced being insufficient to saturate the soap-lees.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
