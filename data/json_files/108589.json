The experiments aimed to measure the difference in gravity at the top and bottom of a deep mine, with the goal of improving upon previous methods and reducing errors. The author discusses the challenges faced during the experiments and the potential improvements offered by new technologies, such as telegraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geodesy"}
