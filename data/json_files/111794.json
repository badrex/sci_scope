The author focuses on the variation of elements in elliptic motion, the motion of a free simple pendulum, and transformations of differential equations using new variables. The results are applied to planetary theory, providing a comprehensive understanding of the motion of a planetary system.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics"}
