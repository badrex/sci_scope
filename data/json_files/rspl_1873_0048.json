This phenomenon explains various sound-related phenomena, including Prof. Tyndall's observations off the South Poreland. The paper also describes experiments that support the theory and shows that sound refraction is more significant on bright, hot days than on cloudy days.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atmospheric Science & Meteorology"}
