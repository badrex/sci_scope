He suggests that the mechanism involves the adherence of corpuscles to the vessel wall, followed by pressure from within, and the use of principles of 'flow' and 'progressive cohesive attraction' in the structure of animal membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Cell Biology & Histology"}
