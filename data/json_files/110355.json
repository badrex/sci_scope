The phenomenon, which was not accompanied by the usual flashes of an Aurora, appeared to flow rapidly from east to west and was compared to a stream of light from the pipe of an engine. Stars of the second and third magnitudes were visible through the arch, and the light's intensity gradually decreased towards the western horizon. The phenomenon lasted for about twenty minutes before disappearing completely.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrogeophysics & Meteorology"}
