The study reveals the development of complementary prisms and the existence of two varieties of hexagonal crystals. The author also discusses the substance's chemical characters and solubility in various solvents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Crystallography & Materials Science"}
