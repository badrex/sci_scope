The study reveals that extension and nimbi are influenced by atomic mass, volatility, and chemical properties, while continuous spectra are more prominent in metalloids and their volatile oxides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry"}
