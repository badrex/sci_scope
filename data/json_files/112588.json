The author then develops a method for synthesizing this substance and related compounds by reacting aniline and acetic acid with trichloride of phosphorus. The mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the author proposes a naming system for organic compounds based on the properties of their constituent groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Organic Chemistry &amp; Compounds"}
