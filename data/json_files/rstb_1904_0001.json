The fungus is found to be present in a specific layer of the seed and is suggested to be a case of symbiosis rather than true parasitism. The author also discusses the challenges in growing the fungus outside its host-plant and determining its systematic position within the fungal kingdom.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
