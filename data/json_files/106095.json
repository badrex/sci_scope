The experiments reveal that different salts have varying degrees of resistance to congelation, with sea salt having the least resistance. The author also discusses the potential implications of these findings in understanding the behavior of salts in natural environments, such as the ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics"}
