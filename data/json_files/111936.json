The study uses magnetography data from Kew Observatory and discusses the relationship between magnetic disturbances, earth currents, and auroral displays. The author suggests that the earth's magnetic field can be compared to a Ruhmkorff's machine, with the lower atmosphere acting as an insulating material between the earth and the rarefied upper atmosphere, which becomes conducting and forms the secondary coil of this arrangement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Magnetosphere & Space Weather"}
