The study reveals that different colors of light have varying degrees of flexibility, which cannot be fully explained by Sir Isaac Newton's theory. This finding challenges the existing understanding of the phenomena of flexion and refraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
