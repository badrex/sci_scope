The study reveals that these species have distinct male and female individuals, challenging the previous understanding of Rotifera as hermaphrodites. The findings expand our knowledge of the sexual relations within the Rotifera class and may lead to further research on other species within the group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Zoology & Animal Behavior"}
