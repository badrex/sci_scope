He describes experiments involving helices, magnets, and voltaic batteries, and introduces the concept of the electro-tonic state. Faraday also explains the electromagnetic effect of induced electric currents in conductors due to the relative motion of magnets and conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics"}
