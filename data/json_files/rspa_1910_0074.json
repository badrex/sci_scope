They find that the mean deflection experienced by a \u03b2-particle passing through a material is dependent on the number of atoms per unit volume, the radius of an atom, and the mean deflection angle produced by an atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Atomic & Nuclear Physics"}
