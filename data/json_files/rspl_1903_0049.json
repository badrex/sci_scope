They propose that these luminous manifestations may be the outcome of oscillatory changes in molecular structure, such as isomeric changes, and suggest that substances capable of existing in isodynamic forms may exhibit triboluminescence when crushed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions"}
