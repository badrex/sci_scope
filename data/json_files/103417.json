Rogers observed the variation of the magnetic compass during his voyage from California to Guam, providing valuable data for understanding magnetic variations in the Pacific Ocean. The data suggests that the East Variation diminishes to about 3/4 of a degree at about 250-300 leagues west of the South-head of California, and gradually increases to about 12 degrees for 1300 leagues, then decreases again at the Isle of Guam.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geophysics & Geomagnetism"}
