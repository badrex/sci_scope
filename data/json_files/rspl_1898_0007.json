They find that glasses with higher lead oxide content exhibit higher conductivity and specific inductive capacity, suggesting a potential correlation between these properties and the glass's composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Materials Science & Engineering"}
