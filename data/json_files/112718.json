The study aims to determine the conditions for maintaining the energy and type of disturbance in a wave and the changes in wave type when the substance is in an adiabatic state. The author also explores the impossibility of propagating waves of longitudinal disturbance of absolutely permanent type for an indefinite distance and the conversion of adiabatic waves into sudden disturbance waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Thermodynamics & Fluid Dynamics"}
