Experiments reveal that the addition of large quantities of one element to a source containing another element does not cause the broadening of lines, suggesting that temporary associations of atoms are not the explanation for these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy"}
