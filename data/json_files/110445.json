He proposes that the vocal organs combine properties of wind and stringed musical instruments, with the length of the vibrating portions of the vocal chords determining the tone's gravity or acuteness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Speech & Hearing Sciences"}
