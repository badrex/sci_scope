The study reveals that the spectrum is similar to that of Comet Daniel, with strong carbon group radiations and other lines. The origin of some lines remains uncertain, but the majority can be linked to carbon or its compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astrophysics & Space Science"}
