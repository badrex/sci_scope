He discusses a deviation in the instrument's plane due to differences in expansion in its braces and presents an instance where the pole star's inferior passage was delayed by 25 seconds due to sunlight shining on the upper western brace. This discovery has led him to question the accuracy of his previous solar transit observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Astroinstrumentation & Observational Techniques"}
