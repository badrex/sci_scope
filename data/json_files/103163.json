Derham, observed the lunar eclipse on January 12, 1711-12, and recorded the eclipse's progression using an excellent six-foot telescope and a micrometer. He noted the time, the Moon's diameter, and the distance of the shadow from the Moon's opposite luminous limb. Unfortunately, he disordered his micrometer at the beginning of the eclipse, preventing him from taking accurate measurements of the inclination of the cusps and other observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Lunar Observations & Eclipse Studies"}
