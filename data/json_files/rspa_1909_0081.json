The study aims to measure geological time using the ratio of helium to radioactive matter. The author finds that certain ironstones contain significant amounts of helium, indicating ages much greater than previously estimated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Geochemistry & Radiochemistry"}
