The meteorite is primarily composed of iron and nickel with some carbon, phosphorus, and silicon. The internal structure reveals large ferrite crystals separated by iron-nickel alloy veins, with fine crystallites embedded in the ferrite. The meteorite's unique structure is characterized by 'Widmannstatten figures' and exhibits interesting properties such as malleability and magnetic susceptibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Meteoritics & Planetary Science"}
