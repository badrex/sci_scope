They demonstrate that these squares can be added without losing the magic property and can be treated as elements of a linear algebra. The author also presents a method for working out the properties of third-order magic squares and discusses enumeration associated with a given sum.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Combinatorics & Number Theory"}
