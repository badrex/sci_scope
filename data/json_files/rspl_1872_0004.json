The study uses a stethometer to measure the dimensions of respiratory movements and provides insights into the complex nature of forward and upward motions during respiration. The author concludes that the bending or straightening of the ribs is crucial for the forward movement, and the intrinsic thoracic muscles play a significant role in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Anatomy"}
