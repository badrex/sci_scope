The study provides insight into the development of the nervous system in such cases and contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Neuroscience & Developmental Biology"}
