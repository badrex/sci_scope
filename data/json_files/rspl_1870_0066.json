The method involves using two coils connected by a cable, one being placed in a test-bath and the other in a distant or inaccessible location. The electrical balance between the resistances of the two coils indicates the temperature at the distant location.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Electrical & Thermal Physics"}
