Additionally, the author discusses the undercurrent theory in oceanography, its axioms, and its implications for understanding the natural history and geological results of the ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics"}
