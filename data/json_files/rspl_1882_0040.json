The study focuses on the contractile organs and their structural arrangements, which facilitate the redistribution of fluids in the tissues, influencing the extent and rapidity of the movements. The findings suggest that the structural features play a crucial role in determining the occurrence and characteristics of these movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
