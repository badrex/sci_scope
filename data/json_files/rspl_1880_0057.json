The author investigates how altitude influences breathing rate, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production in two individuals. The results provide insights into the physiological changes that occur at high altitudes and the challenges faced by mountain climbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental & Earth Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Human Physiology & Climatology"}
