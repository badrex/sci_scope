This curve is derived from completing Poisson's analysis and can be used to extend the theory of correlation. The author also discusses its applications, such as the binomial and multinomial probability curves, and its relation to the symmetrical probability surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics & Statistics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Probability & Statistics"}
