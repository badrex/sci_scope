Desaguliers on light and colors, focusing on the separation of primary colors and the role of prism refraction. They describe the importance of using a greenish glass prism to minimize color mixing and provide detailed accounts of their experiments, which support Newton's color theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Optics & Light"}
