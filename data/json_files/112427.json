Broughton, discovered that living plants excrete carbonic acid, not only in their normal condition, but also after being deprived of oxygen for days. This evolution is connected with the life of the plant and is due to two causes: previous oxidation and the separation of carbonic acid from the plant's proximate principles during growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology & Life Sciences", "scientific_subdiscipline": "Plant Biology & Ecology"}
