tldr: The author discusses the observations made by Cassini regarding Jupiter's rotation
  and its four known moons. These observations confirmed the rotation of the moons
  around Jupiter, similar to the Moon's rotation around Earth. The author also mentions
  the discovery of a permanent spot on Jupiter, which helped determine its rotation
  period and the inclination of its axis.
