scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author conducts magnetic experiments on an iron steam-vessel to determine
  the deviation of the magnetic needle caused by the vessel's iron components. The
  study provides valuable insights into the influence of iron on compass readings
  and helps improve navigation techniques.
