scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Protozoology
tldr: The author examines flagellate infections in Hemiptera insects in Uganda, discovering
  various forms of herpetomonads and crithidia in the gut and salivary glands. The
  study provides insights into the potential transmission of parasitic flagellates
  and the complex interactions that may have contributed to diseases like trypanosomiasis,
