revised_title: Anatomy and Function of the Nervous System in Actinia
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuroanatomy
tldr: The author examines the nervous system of Actinia, focusing on the histology
  of chromatophores and the role of various cells and tissues in transmitting nerve
  signals. The study suggests the presence of a continuous plexus around Actinia and
  beneath each chromatophore, which aids in the physiological action of these structures
  in relation to light.
