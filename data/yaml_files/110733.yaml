revised_title: Investigating the Phenomenon of Hoar-Frost and its Relation to Temperature
  and Air Currents
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, James Farquharson, examines the localities affected by hoar-frost
  and the currents of air it generates. He observes that hoar-frost occurs in low-lying
  areas during calm and clear nights, and that downward air currents on valley slopes
  play a significant role in preventing frost formation on inclined surfaces. Farquharson
  credits Dr. Wells' theory for providing a framework for understanding these phenomena.
