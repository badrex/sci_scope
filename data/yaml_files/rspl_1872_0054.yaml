  Effect of Riveted Joints and Hole Preparation'

scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the durability and preservation of iron ships, focusing
  on riveted joints and the effects of hole preparation methods. The study reveals
  that drilled holes result in weaker joints, while punched holes provide a better
  test of iron quality. Additionally, hand-riveting is found to produce slightly stronger
  joints than machine-riveting.
