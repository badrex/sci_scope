revised_title: 'Anatomy and Physiology of Spongiadae: A New Classification System'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author proposes a new classification system for sponges based on their skeletal
  structure and organic organization, rejecting previous systems that relied on external
  form or chemical constituents. The study describes the spicula, the sponge's unique
  skeletal elements, and their various forms and functions, as well as the sarcode
  system, which plays a crucial role in sponge organization and physiology.
