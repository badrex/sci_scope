revised_title: A Defense of the Oblate Spheroid Shape of the Earth
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author refutes the claims made by Mons. Mairan that the Earth's oblate spheroid
  shape is inconsistent with pendulum observations. Desaguliers argues that the Earth's
  shape is determined by gravity and centrifugal force, and that Mairan's calculations
  are based on incorrect assumptions.
