tldr: This article reports on the sudden and remarkable flux and reflux of the sea
  at Antigua, as well as other coastal areas, on November 1, 1755. The author, Capt.
  Affleck, describes the event as an unusual natural phenomenon, with the sea rising
  twelve feet perpendicular several times and then quickly receding. Similar occurrences
  were reported in other parts of the West Indies, such as Barbados, Martinique, and
  the island of Sabia. The article also mentions that the event was preceded by an
  earthquake, which is the second one felt in Antigua.
