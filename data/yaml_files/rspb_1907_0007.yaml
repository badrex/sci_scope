revised_title: Optimizing Sewage Treatment Through Nitrification and Filter Design
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Engineering & Sanitation
tldr: The author investigates the nitrification process in sewage treatment and finds
  that reducing filter particle size and ensuring adequate aeration can significantly
  improve the efficiency and quality of the treatment. The study also suggests that
  different depths of the filter have varying effects on the nitrification process.
