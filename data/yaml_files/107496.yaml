tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, conducted a series of magnetic observations during
  a voyage in search of a North West Passage. He measured the dip and variation of
  the magnetic needle and the intensity of the magnetic force at various locations.
  The findings provide valuable data for understanding Earth's magnetic field and
  its impact on navigation.
