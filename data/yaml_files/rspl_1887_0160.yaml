revised_title: Further Observations on the Electromotive Properties of the Electrical
  Organ of Torpedo marmorata

scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuroscience
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the electrical organ
  of Torpedo marmorata, focusing on the phenomena of 'irreciprocal conduction' and
  the influence of temperature and other conditions on the organ's response to stimulation.
  The study reveals that the organ's response is multiple and that each response produces
  currents similarly directed through its columns, reinforcing the force of the primary
  explosion in its own substance and that of its neighbors.
