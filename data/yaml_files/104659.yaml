revised_title: Investigating the Beatification Experiment and Odour Transmission through
  Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author, William Watson, discusses the unsuccessful attempts to replicate
  the experiments of Mr. Pivati and Mr. Winkler, who claimed to have transmitted odours
  through electricity. Watson also examines the Beatification experiment, in which
  Professor Bose claimed to have caused a luminous 'glory' to appear around a person's
  head using electricity. Despite Watson's efforts, he was unable to reproduce these
  phenomena, raising questions about their validity and the need for further investigation.
