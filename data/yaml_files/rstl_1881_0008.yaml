tldr: The authors investigate the electrical resistance of thin liquid films, specifically
  soap films, and their findings contribute to understanding the properties of soap
  films and the radius of molecular attraction. They also discuss the limitations
  of previous experiments and propose a novel method to study these phenomena.
topics:
- Capillarity
- Soap Films
- Surface Tension
- Molecular Attraction
- Electric Current
