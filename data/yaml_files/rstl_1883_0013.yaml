revised_title: On Electrical Motions in a Spherical Conductor
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical motions in a spherical conductor, focusing
  on the effects of magnetic susceptibility and specific resistance. They explore
  various modes of free and forced motion, and discuss the implications of Maxwell's
  theory of electricity on these phenomena.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Electrical Conductivity
- Electromotive Force
- Dielectric Materials
