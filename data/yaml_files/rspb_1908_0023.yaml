revised_title: 'Bacteria and the Oxidation of Amorphous Carbon: A New Insight into
  Carbon Utilization in Soil'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Microbial Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the role of bacteria in the oxidation of amorphous carbon,
  such as charcoal, coal, and peat, and discovers that certain bacteria can slowly
  oxidize amorphous carbon, releasing CO2 and making the carbon available for plant
  life.
