revised_title: Magnetical Experiments on Iron Steam Vessels and Compass Deviations
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: Captain Edward Johnson's experiments on the iron steam vessel 'Bloodhound' aimed
  to determine if steam's effect on the vessel's hull influenced a compass' functionality
  and whether keeling affected compass deviations. The study found that keeling did
  impact compass deviations, emphasizing the importance of measuring compass deviations
  throughout a ship's voyage.
