scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Dynamics
tldr: In a letter to Monsieur Petit, Signor Cassini discusses his observations of
  spots on the planet Venus and their motion. He notes the difficulty in determining
  whether the observed motion is due to revolution or libration, as the spots are
  difficult to observe and track over time.
