revised_title: Investigating the Ovary Structure of Ornithorhynchus paradoxus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Development
tldr: Richard Owen examines the ovary structure of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus,
  a unique egg-laying mammal, and compares it to normal mammalian and oviparous vertebrate
  structures. He confirms that lactation can coexist with oviparous modes of reproduction
  and demonstrates the Ornithorhynchus as a connecting link in the gradation of reproductive
  modes among mammals.
