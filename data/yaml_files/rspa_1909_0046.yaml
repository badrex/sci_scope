revised_title: An Improved Method for Determining the Boiling Points of Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author presents a new experimental method for determining the boiling points
  of metals using a vertical carbon tube furnace and a graphite crucible. The method
  involves measuring the temperature of the crucible's outer walls and observing the
  surface of the molten metal as it approaches boiling. This method provides more
  accurate and consistent results compared to previous techniques.
