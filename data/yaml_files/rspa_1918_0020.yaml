revised_title: Carnot's Postulate and the Nature of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author explores the nature of heat based on Carnot's postulate, discussing
  the relationship between heat and motive power in thermodynamic processes. The study
  suggests that heat may be a form of energy that can be partially converted into
  ordered or mechanical energy, rather than a substance that merely falls to a lower
  level of temperature.
