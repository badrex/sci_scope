revised_title: Investigating the Origin of Atmospheric Lines in the Solar Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the atmospheric lines of the solar
  spectrum and the spectra of various gases. They find that oxygen and nitrogen do
  not absorb rays of the same refrangibility at the ordinary temperature as they emit
  when heated, suggesting that these gases are not the primary cause of atmospheric
  lines.
