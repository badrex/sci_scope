tldr: Henry Baker reports on a fiery meteor observed in Norwich in July 1750. The
  meteor's direction was from north to south, and it had a bright silver-colored nucleus
  and a tail resembling a burning coal. The excessive heat in the preceding days is
  suggested as a possible cause for the meteor's generation. The author submits the
  observation for consideration by the Royal Society.
