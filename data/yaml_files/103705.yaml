tldr: The author shares a method for successfully growing exotic seeds with hard shells,
  such as the coco-nut, by planting them in a hot-bed made with tanners-bark and providing
  them with consistent heat and moisture. This method has also been found effective
  in restoring exotic trees that have suffered from long journeys without soil or
