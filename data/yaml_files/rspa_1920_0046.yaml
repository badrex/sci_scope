  Tube Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author extends the Balmer series of hydrogen by using a new type of vacuum
  tube and discovers a remarkable type of tube with unique spectroscopic phenomena.
  This new tube allows for the separation and study of compound spectra, potentially
  opening a new field in spectroscopy.
