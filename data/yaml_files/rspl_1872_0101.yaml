revised_title: Investigations into the Conductivity of Electrolytes and the Decomposition
  of Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the conductivity of various electrolytes and the decomposition
  of acids using an electrometer. They find that a battery using zinc and copper electrodes
  with chloride of zinc as the electrolyte offers low internal resistance and is capable
  of decomposing dilute acids. Such a battery is well-suited for applications in telegraphy
  due to its ability to renew its strength during periods of rest.
