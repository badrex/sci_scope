revised_title: Investigating the Emission and Transmission Properties of Röntgen Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: This study investigates the emission and transmission properties of Röntgen
  rays using various metal anticathodes and screens. The results show that the relative
  intensities of the radiations do not follow the order of atomic weights, and that
  selective transmission occurs when the screen and radiator are of the same metal.
  The study also provides insights into the atomic weight of nickel and the transmission
  of radiation through different materials.
