revised_title: Torsional Strain in Glass Fibers After Release from Twisting Stress
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the residual torsional strain in a glass fiber after
  releasing twisting stress and examines Boltzmann's law to understand the relationship
  between stress and time. The results show that the principle of superposition is
  only approximate, and the formula needs modification for different twisting durations.
