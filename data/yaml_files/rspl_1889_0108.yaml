revised_title: On the Effect of Tension on Magnetic Changes of Length in Wires of
  Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the effect of tension on magnetic changes of length
  in wires of iron, nickel, and cobalt. The results indicate that the maximum elongation
  decreases as the load increases, and contraction begins earlier in the magnetization
  process. This study disproves Joule's conjecture that certain critical tension would
  result in no change in wire length during magnetization.
