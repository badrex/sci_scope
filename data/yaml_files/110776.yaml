scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: J. S. Bowerbank examines the organic tissues in bony corals using diluted nitric
  acid and microscopy. He discovers a complex reticulated vascular tissue and other
  structures, such as larger tubes with valves and spherical masses. He also finds
  siliceous spicula and minute bodies that he believes are similar to cytoblasts or
  nuclei.
