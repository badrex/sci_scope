revised_title: Investigating the Spiral Structure of Intestinal Fibers
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: Dr. William Cole presents an alternative hypothesis to the annular structure
  of intestinal fibers, suggesting that they may be spiral in nature. He conducts
  experiments on animal intestines to observe the structure and function of these
  fibers, providing evidence for the spiral hypothesis and its implications for the
  peristaltic motion of the intestines.
