revised_title: The Function and Action of Intercostal Muscles in Respiratory Movements
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: John Hutchinson's research investigates the function and action of intercostal
  muscles in respiratory movements. He demonstrates that external intercostal muscles
  are true inspiratory muscles, elevating the ribs and increasing the chest cavity,
  while internal intercostal muscles have a double action, serving as both elevators
  of cartilages and expiratory muscles. The study also explores the differences between
  external thoracic space and internal pulmonic space, and various types of breathing
  patterns in health and disease.
