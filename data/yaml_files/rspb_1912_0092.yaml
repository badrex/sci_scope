revised_title: The Relationship Between Trachea Size, Body Weight, Surface Area, Blood
  Volume, and Aorta Size in Warm-Blooded Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the size of the trachea in warm-blooded animals and
  find a relationship between tracheal area, body weight, surface area, blood volume,
  and aorta size. They conclude that the tracheal area is a simple function of the
  body surface, with the formula T = W^n/k, where T is the tracheal area, W is the
  body weight, n is approximately 0.70-0.72, and k is a constant.
