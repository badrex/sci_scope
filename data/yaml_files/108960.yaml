revised_title: On the Motion of a Rigid Body in the Absence of External Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a rigid body acted upon by no external
  forces using an ellipsoidal model. They demonstrate how the time of passage between
  positions can be determined and how the motion of a set of related bodies can be
  completely described using confocal ellipsoids.
topics:
- Rigid Body Dynamics
- Kinematics
- Ellipsoidal Motion
- Confocal Ellipsoids
- Angular Velocity
