scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the temperature difference between snow and
  air during cold weather, observing the effects of wind, aurora borealis, and snow
  evaporation. The experiments provide evidence against the idea that the temperature
  difference is caused by evaporation or hoarfrost deposition.
