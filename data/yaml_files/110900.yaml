tldr: Thomas H. Henry investigates the properties of tin and iodine compounds, discovering
  that the substance obtained by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine is a
  mixture of two salts. He also finds that one salt is soluble in water, while the
  other decomposes upon contact with water. Henry concludes that one salt is the real
  proto-iodide described by Boullay, and the other is a biniodide, a salt previously
  undescribed in detail.
