revised_title: Magnetized Electrodes and Electrical Discharge Phenomena in Rarefied
  Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of magnetized electrodes on electrical discharge
  phenomena in rarefied gases. They observe that when the electrodes are oppositely
  magnetized, green patches on the inner glass surface vanish, and a hazy blue cloud
  forms between the points. A luminous ring appears within the bulb when the electrodes
  are magnetized, and this ring is sensitive to changes in the charge on the glass
  walls.
