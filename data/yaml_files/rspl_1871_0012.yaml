tldr: This paper presents the results of a magnetic survey conducted in the east of
  France in 1869, providing data on dip, declination, intensity, and horizontal force.
  Additionally, the paper discusses the behavior of supersaturated saline solutions
  when exposed to open air, revealing that they can be kept uncovered for hours without
  crystallizing.
