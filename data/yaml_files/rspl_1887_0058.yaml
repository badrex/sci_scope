revised_title: The Origin of Chert and Silicification of Fossils in Carboniferous
  Limestone
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author argues against the theory that the silica in Carboniferous chert
  was derived from sponge-spicules, presenting evidence for the direct replacement
  of limestone by silica in ocean waters. The silicification of fossils is explained
  through the process of pseudomorphism.
