revised_title: 'The Action of Anaesthetics on Living Tissues: Part I - The Action
  on Isolated Nerve'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of anaesthetics on isolated nerve tissue,
  specifically focusing on the impact on the injury current and electrical resistance.
  They find that chloroform and ether affect the injury current and electrical resistance
  of nerve tissue, with varying results depending on the concentration and application
  method.

- Nerve Physiology
- Anaesthetics
- Neural Injury
- Electrical Resistance
- Nerve Tissue
