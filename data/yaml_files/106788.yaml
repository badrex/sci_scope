revised_title: Investigating the Production of Light and Heat from Different Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to investigate the production of
  light and heat from various materials, such as metals and earthenware, when exposed
  to high temperatures. The results suggest that the absorption and emission of light
  in red-hot bodies are complex and involve the nature of matter's constituent parts
  and their relative arrangements.
topics:
- Thermal Radiation
- Heat Conduction
- Blackbody Radiation
- Metals and Heat
- Optical Properties of Materials
