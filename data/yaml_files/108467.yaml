tldr: The author examines the nervous supply and ganglia of the heart, providing evidence
  of the presence of nerves and ganglia in various regions of the heart, including
  the apex and the left ventricle. The study also reveals the existence of a fibrous

  heart's muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and adipose tissue together.
