revised_title: Revision of the Atomic Weight of Aluminum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author revises the atomic weight of aluminum by examining previous experiments
  and methods, concluding that the previous value assigned to the atomic weight may
  have been too high. The author suggests that further research and the use of pure
  metallic aluminum is needed for a more accurate determination of the atomic weight.
