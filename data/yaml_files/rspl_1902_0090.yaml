revised_title: On the Electrodynamic and Thermal Relations of Energy of Magnetisation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the energy of magnetization and its electrodynamic and
  thermal relations, proposing that the energy of magnetization is derived from a
  combination of local and intrinsic factors, and that it is not solely dependent
  on the electrodynamic field.
