revised_title: Investigating the Conveyance of Non-White Liquids by Lacteals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author presents experiments demonstrating that lacteals, vessels in the
  digestive system, often convey non-white liquids, including chyle and a transparent
  humor called liquor refuus. These findings challenge previous assumptions about
  the role of lacteals and contribute to the understanding of the digestive system
  and blood circulation.
