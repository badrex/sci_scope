revised_title: Dynamical Stability and Oscillations of Floating Bodies
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Naval Architecture & Shipbuilding
tldr: The author investigates the dynamical stability of floating bodies and the conditions
  of quick and slow rolling. The paper presents a theorem that calculates a ship's
  dynamical stability and provides formulae for the times of rolling and pitching.
  Experiments conducted by Mr. Fincham and Mr. Rawson verify the theorem and its applications
  in practice.
