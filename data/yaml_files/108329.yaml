revised_title: Investigating the Physiological Action of Electric Current on Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the physiological effects of electric current on nerves
  using a modified frog preparation and a specialized apparatus. The experiments reveal
  that the direct and inverse currents have different effects on nerve contraction,
  with the direct current causing contractions at the moment it begins to circulate
  and the inverse current causing contractions only at the moment it ceases to pass.
  The study highlights the importance of measuring nerve contractions to better understand
  the physiological action of electric currents.
