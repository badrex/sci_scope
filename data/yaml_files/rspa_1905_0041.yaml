revised_title: Experimental Analysis of Explosives' Transformations Under Varying
  Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Materials
tldr: Sir Andrew Noble investigates the transformations of modern explosives, such
  as cordite and nitro-cellulose, under varying pressures. He presents a series of
  experiments and their results, including densities, volumes of gases generated,
  and pressures, to determine the differences in the transformations and potential
  energy of these explosives.
