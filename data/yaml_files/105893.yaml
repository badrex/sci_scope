scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a new method for finding the roots of equations using geometric
  constructions and rulers. The method involves drawing certain right lines and moving
  rulers to describe a curve that represents the equation's roots. This method can
  be applied to equations of any dimensions.
