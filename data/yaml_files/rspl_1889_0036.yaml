revised_title: 'A New Form of Gas Battery: Improving the Efficiency of Grove''s Gas
  Battery'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy Storage
tldr: The authors present a new form of gas battery that improves upon Grove's original
  design by using a quasi-solid electrolyte and maintaining the absorbent's condensing
  power. This new design increases the contact between gases, electrolyte, and absorbent,
  resulting in a more efficient battery with a higher electromotive force and lower
  internal resistance.
