scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author analyzes the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula and identifies
  64 lines, nine of which are due to hydrogen. The spectrum is found to be a compound
  one, consisting of hydrogen lines, low-temperature metallic lines, and high-temperature
  lines. The study confirms the association between the Orion Nebula, planetary nebulae,
  and bright line stars in classification schemes.
