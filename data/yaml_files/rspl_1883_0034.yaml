revised_title: Protoplasmic Continuity in Vegetable Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the continuity of protoplasm between cells in plants,
  specifically in pulvini and endosperm cells. Using staining techniques and examining
  various plant species, the author demonstrates that cells communicate with each
  other through delicate protoplasmic threads, suggesting that plants are interconnected
  systems rather than isolated cells.
