scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the incidence of cancer in mice of known age and find
  a progressive increase in cancer rates, corresponding to the age of the mice. This
  study provides evidence that the age-incidence of cancer is similar in both animals
  and humans, emphasizing the importance of considering age when studying cancer.
