revised_title: An Investigation into the Absorption and Reabsorption of Helium and
  Associated Gases in Minerals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the conditions in which helium and associated gases
  exist in minerals, examining their absorption and reabsorption under varying pressures.
  The study reveals that minerals like cleveite can reabsorb helium, and the absorption
  is roughly proportional to the pressure applied.
