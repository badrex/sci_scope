revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Temperature on Transit Instruments
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the impact of temperature on transit instruments, specifically
  the derangements caused by the expansion of braces. Through a series of experiments,
  he demonstrates that the expansion of the braces can cause deviations in the telescope,
  affecting the accuracy of the instrument.
