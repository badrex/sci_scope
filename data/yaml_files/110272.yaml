scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Algebra
tldr: The author provides a comprehensive view of the elliptic transcendents theory,
  deducing all connected truths from a single principle. The study explores the analogy
  between elliptic transcendents and circular arcs, enabling the application of similar
  methods of investigation, simplifying the demonstrations and highlighting the close
  relationship between the two cases.
