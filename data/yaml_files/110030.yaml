revised_title: Investigating the Changes in Declination of Fixed Stars and Instrument
  Flexure
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Positional Astronomy
tldr: The author, John Pond, examines changes in the declination of fixed stars and
  investigates the possibility of errors in instruments and observation methods. He
  concludes that errors in the Catalogue of 1813 are significant and that instrument
  flexure may be a contributing factor to discrepancies in star positions.
