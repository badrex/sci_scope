scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reaction between monamines and monophosphines to
  create compounds containing both nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to ureas but with
  phosphorus replacing nitrogen. The study focuses on the formation of phosphamines
  and arsamines, and the author discovers new compounds, such as cyanurate of phenyl
  and a urea-like substance containing phosphorus.
