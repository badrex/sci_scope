revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Identity of Voltaic and Common Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the similarities between voltaic
  and common electricity, demonstrating that they share the same properties and effects,
  such as magnetic phenomena, chemical decompositions, and temperature increase. He
  also establishes the galvanometer as an instrument for measuring the absolute quantity
  of transmitted electricity.
