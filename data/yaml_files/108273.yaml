scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author explores the muscular current and its properties using various experimental
  methods, including the galvanoscopic frog and a pile of animal muscles. The research
  confirms the existence and direction of the muscular current and demonstrates its
  relationship to the changes in structure and composition of muscles during nutrition.
