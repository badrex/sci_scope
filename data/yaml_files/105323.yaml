revised_title: Correcting Errors in Refracting Telescopes due to Different Refrangibility
  of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: John Dollond and James Short present experiments on correcting the errors in
  refracting telescopes caused by the different refrangibility of light. They demonstrate
  that by using a combination of two spherical glasses with water between them, telescopes
  can be made free from color distortions and have improved image clarity.
