revised_title: 'Researches on the Refraction, Dispersion, and Sensitiveness of Liquids:
  Part I'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of various
  liquids, discovering a relationship between sensitiveness and the change of volume
  by heat. They also examine the refractive indices of different liquids and propose
  the concept of'refractive energy' to represent the influence of a substance on light
  rays.
topics:
- Optical Properties of Liquids
- Refraction
- Dispersion
- Sensitiveness of Liquids
- Optical Constants
