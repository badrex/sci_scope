tldr: Captain Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the
  length of the seconds pendulum in London and Paris. Using two pendulums, one made
  for M. Schumacher and another for the Board of Longitude, he compared their rates
  in both cities. The results showed a difference in the length of the seconds pendulum
  when transferred from Paris to London, with an acceleration of 12.00.
