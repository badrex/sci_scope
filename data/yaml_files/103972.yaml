scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author calculates the velocity of air moved by a centrifugal blower, determining
  that the air moves at a rate of 93.67 feet per second. The calculation takes into
  account both the force of gravity and the centrifugal force acting on the air in
  the machine.
