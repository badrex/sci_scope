scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This study investigates the torsional hysteresis behavior of mild steel, focusing
  on the stress-strain curve and the existence of hysteresis loops. The authors develop
  a sensitive torsion machine to measure the twist accurately and analyze the effects
  of various treatments on the material's properties.
