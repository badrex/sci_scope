revised_title: Experiment Proving Sound Cannot Be Transmitted Through a Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducts an experiment to determine if sound can be transmitted
  through a vacuum. He places a bell in a sealed container filled with air and then
  evacuates the space outside the container. Despite producing sound within the container,
  no sound is transmitted through the vacuum, confirming that air is the only medium
  for sound propagation.
