revised_title: Ionization of Various Gases by α-, β-, and γ-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the ionization of various gases by α-, β-, and γ-rays,
  finding that the ionization is an additive property of the constituent atoms and
  that the energy required to make an ion from an atom is independent of chemical
  combination.
