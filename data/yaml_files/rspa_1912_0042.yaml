revised_title: Investigations into Flicker and the Effect of Asymmetrical Sectors
  on Disc Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between disc rotation and flicker,
  discovering that the rate of rotation required for flicker to vanish is inversely
  proportional to the number of sectors on a perfectly symmetrical disc. They also
  explore the effect of asymmetrical sectors on disc rotation and illumination, finding
  that asymmetric discs require a higher rate of rotation for flicker to vanish.
