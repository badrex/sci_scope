revised_title: 'Radiation and Absorption: The Influence of Chemical Composition on
  Radiative Power'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: In this paper, Tyndall investigates the behavior of various elementary bodies
  towards radiant heat and examines the influence of chemical composition on radiative
  power. He also explores the effects of different heat sources on the transmission
  of heat through rock-salt plates and the absorption of radiation by these plates.
topics:
- Radiation
- Absorption
- Heat
- Chemical Composition
- Optical Properties
