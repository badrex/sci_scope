scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines a new gas obtained from uraninite and discovers that it
  contains lines similar to those found in the solar chromosphere. The gas is associated
  with hydrogen and may be responsible for some of the chromospheric lines. Further
  research is needed to determine the full properties and potential applications of
  this gas.
