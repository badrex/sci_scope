scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the cause of vision loss when looking
  at objects through a small paper fixed at a certain distance. They conclude that
  the deficiency of vision is likely due to the varying magnitudes of the optic nerve
  in different eyes, and question whether vision is made in the retina or the choroid
  layer of the eye.
