revised_title: Investigating the Decomposition and Oxidation Effects of Alkaline Peroxides
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition and oxidation effects of alkaline
  peroxides, discovering that these reactions follow the normal law of chemical action
  and are subject to atomic ratios. The study also reveals that the supposed differences
  in oxygen properties among peroxides do not exist and that the effects of oxidation
  can be achieved by modifying the experiment's circumstances.
