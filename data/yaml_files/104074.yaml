revised_title: 'A Mechanical Paradox: The Effect of Distance on a Balance''s Equilibrium'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author demonstrates that two equal weights on a balance maintain equilibrium
  regardless of their distance from the center, debunking a mechanical paradox. The
  balance's center of motion and the perpendicular velocities of the weights determine
  the balance's equilibrium, not the distance from the center.
