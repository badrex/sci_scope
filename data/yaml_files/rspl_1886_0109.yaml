revised_title: A New Form of Direct Vision Spectroscope for Enhanced Observations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors present a new form of direct vision spectroscope with three symmetrically
  arranged prisms, which offers improved definition and dispersion for observing shifting
  objects, such as aurorae and meteors. This instrument allows for better visibility
  of faint spectra and provides enhanced accuracy in measurements of refrangibility.
