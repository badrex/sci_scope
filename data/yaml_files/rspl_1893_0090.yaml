revised_title: 'The Organogeny of Asterina gibbosa: A Comparative Study with Antedon
  and Insights into Echinoderm Evolution'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Evolution
tldr: The author investigates the organogeny of Asterina gibbosa and compares it with
  Antedon, providing insights into the evolution of echinoderms. The study reveals
  differences in the development of the two species, with Asterina having a ventrally
  flexed body and Antedon exhibiting an excessive growth of the ventral surface. These
  findings challenge previous conclusions based on the supposed homology of the dorsal-central
  structures in echinoderms.
