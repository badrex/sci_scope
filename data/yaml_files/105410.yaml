revised_title: Artificial Cold Production and Mercury Congelation Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: The article describes experiments conducted in Petersburg that produced artificial
  cold using a mixture of spirit of nitre and snow. The experiments resulted in the
  congelation of mercury, which was observed to have properties similar to other metals.
  The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of substances at extremely
  low temperatures.
