revised_title: The Relationship between Ionization and Velocity for Beta Particles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: This study investigates the variation of ionization with velocity for beta particles,
  using a thick copper vessel. The results show a clear correlation between ionization
  and velocity, which is essential for understanding radioactive decay and atomic
  physics.
