tldr: The author investigates the distribution of nerves in dental pulp, focusing
  on the intricate plexus of non-medullated fibers beneath the odontoblast layer.
  The study examines various theories on nerve terminations and their connection to
  dentine, concluding that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship
  between sensory impressions and dental tissues.
