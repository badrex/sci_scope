tldr: The author presents an electrical apparatus designed to demonstrate the effects
  of points and balls at the upper terminations of conductors in protecting buildings
  from lightning damage. The experiments show that points effectively draw off electrical
  matter, preventing explosions, while balls can cause violent explosions and endanger
  buildings.
