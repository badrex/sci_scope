tldr: The author presents a new electroscope and electrometer design to study elementary
  laws of electricity. Experiments show that the attractive force is inversely proportional
  to the square of the number of conductors and directly proportional to the square
  of the electrical quantity. The author also distinguishes between tension and intensity
  in electricity and investigates the electrical capacities of various conducting
  bodies.
