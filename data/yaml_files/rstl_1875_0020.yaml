revised_title: Spectroscopic Observations of the Sun's Chromosphere
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics
tldr: The authors present spectroscopic observations of the sun's chromosphere and
  prominences made between October 1872 and December 1873. They describe their methods
  and instruments, including a 6-inch refracting telescope and a diffraction grating
  spectroscope. The observations provide valuable data on the height, width, and position
  of solar prominences, contributing to the understanding of the sun's behavior and
  its impact on Earth.
