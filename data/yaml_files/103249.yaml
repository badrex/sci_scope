revised_title: Experiments on the Weight of Water under Different Conditions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the weight of water under various
  conditions, such as temperature and vacuum. The results show that water does not
  compress when air is removed, and that heat can cause water to expand and decrease
  in density.
