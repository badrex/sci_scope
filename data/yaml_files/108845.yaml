  Gases'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule and Thomson investigate the thermal effects of fluids in motion using
  a porous plug and high-pressure gases. They find that the difference in temperature
  between the high and low-pressure sides of the plug is proportional to the difference
  in pressure, and that the cooling effect decreases when using gases at high temperatures.
