revised_title: The Effect of Daylight on the Propagation of Electromagnetic Impulses
  over Long Distances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wireless Communication
tldr: Marconi and Fleming's experiments reveal that the transmission of electromagnetic
  waves over long distances is significantly affected by daylight. During daylight,
  the signals weaken and become undetectable at greater distances, while at night,
  the signals remain strong and can be detected up to 2099 miles away. The cause of
  this difference may be due to the discharging influence of daylight on the transmitting
  elevated conductor, reducing the amplitude of the oscillations.
