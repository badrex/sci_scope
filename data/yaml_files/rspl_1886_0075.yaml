revised_title: Improving Electric Arc Light Intensity with Fluted Craterless Carbons
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Energy
tldr: Sir James N. Douglass investigates fluted craterless carbons for arc lighting
  and discovers that they provide a larger vertical angle of radiant light and a steadier
  light due to the localization of current at the central portion of each carbon.
  The use of fluted carbons can improve the efficiency of electric arc lights in lighthouse
  illumination.
