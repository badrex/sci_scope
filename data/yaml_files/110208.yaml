revised_title: Investigation of Periodical Colors Produced by Grooved Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the phenomenon of periodical colors produced
  by grooved surfaces on metallic and transparent bodies. He observes that the colors
  depend on the number of grooves and intervals, and the angle of incidence. Brewster
  also explores the effects of using different materials and explains the underlying
  principles of these phenomena using both emission and undulatory hypotheses.
