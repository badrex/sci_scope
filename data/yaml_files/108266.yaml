scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author discovers a unique optical phenomenon in quinine solutions, where
  a diluted solution of quinine and tartaric acid exhibits a vivid celestial blue
  color on the surface when exposed to strong daylight or sunshine. This color is
  not present in other alkaloids or acids tested and is not affected by the thickness
  of the liquid.
