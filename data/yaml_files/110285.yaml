revised_title: On the Inflexion and Deflection of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the phenomena of light inflexion and deflection, comparing
  the appearance of shadows at different distances and analyzing the curvature of
  the rays. He proposes a hypothesis that light consists of material particles with
  a power of mutual repulsion, which can explain the observed phenomena and the hyperbolic
  path of the rays.
