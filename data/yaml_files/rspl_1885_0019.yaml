scientific_subdiscipline: Biology & Life Sciences
tldr: The author presents a simple method for constructing the honey bee's cell using
  geometrical principles without employing angles. The method involves inscribing
  an equilateral triangle in a hexagon and constructing trapeziums to form a hexagonal
  prism, which accurately fits three lozenges.
