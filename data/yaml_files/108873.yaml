revised_title: On the Geometry of Water-Line Curves
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates water-line curves, or neoids, in two dimensions and
  develops a mathematical framework for understanding their properties. These curves
  are essential for determining the optimal water-line shapes for ships, as they describe
  the flow of water around a ship's hull.
