revised_title: 'Stability of Planetary Systems: Analyzing the Elliptic Constants'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics
tldr: John William Lubbock investigates the stability of planetary systems, focusing
  on the elliptic constants. He demonstrates that the eccentricities and inclinations
  of planets vary within small limits, and the stability of the planetary system is
  preserved, regardless of the power of the disturbing force.
