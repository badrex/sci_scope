revised_title: 'Extinctive Atmospheres Produced by Flames: The Composition of the
  Extinctive Atmospheres'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the composition of atmospheres
  that extinguish flames produced by combustion. The study focuses on the differences
  between wick-fed and gas-fed flames and the minimum proportion of extinctive gas
  required to extinguish a flame.
