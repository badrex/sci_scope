revised_title: The Influence of Carbon Dioxide on Seed Germination and Dormancy
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the role of carbon dioxide in seed germination and dormancy,
  finding that increased carbon dioxide levels inhibit germination and delay the maturation
  process. The research also explores the effects of carbon dioxide on the germination
  of various seeds and the resumption of normal activity upon removal of increased
  carbon dioxide pressures.
