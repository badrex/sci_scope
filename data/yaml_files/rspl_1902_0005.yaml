revised_title: Investigation of Throw-Testing Machine for Reversals of Mean Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors develop a throw-testing machine to study the effects of repeated
  stress on materials, particularly focusing on the reversals of mean stress. They
  find that the limiting range of stress is more rapidly approached with their apparatus
  compared to previous methods, and that the range of stress for rupture decreases
  as the periodicity of the reversals increases.
