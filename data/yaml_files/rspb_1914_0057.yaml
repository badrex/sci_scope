scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The authors successfully cultivate human tumor tissue in vitro, demonstrating
  the growth of both epithelial cells and connective tissue stroma. This finding challenges
  the belief that human tissue can only grow in a medium composed of the blood plasma
  of the same species.
