scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geophysics
tldr: A new volcano erupts in the Mediterranean, forming an island and emitting dense
  white vapor, black matter, and carbonic acid gas. The author, John Davy, examines
  the island and crater, finding a lack of typical volcanic odors and a unique composition
  of materials. The eruption's phenomena support the hypothesis of an ignited nucleus
  of fluid matter forced through the earth's crust by steam and gas.
