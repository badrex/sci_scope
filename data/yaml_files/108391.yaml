revised_title: Periodical Laws in the Mean Effects of Larger Magnetic Disturbances
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author investigates the periodicity in the mean effects of larger magnetic
  disturbances and finds that they have a systematic character connected to the seasons
  of the year and the hours of the day at particular stations. This discovery challenges
  the previous classification of these disturbances as "irregular" and suggests that
  they should be considered as part of the "periodical variations" category.
