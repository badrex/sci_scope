revised_title: 'Atomic Weight of Glucinum or Beryllium: A Reassessment of Impurity
  and Specific Heat'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author examines the atomic weight of glucinum or beryllium, discussing the
  impact of impurity on specific heat measurements and suggesting that further experiments
  with pure beryllium are needed for accurate determination of its atomic weight.
