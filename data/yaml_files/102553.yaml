tldr: The author examines a mineral water sample and discovers that it contains real
  vitriol, which leads to further investigation of similar waters in Northumberland
  and Lancashire. The author concludes that these waters are not true springs but
  rather come from coal-drifts and contain pyrites, which contribute to the formation
  of vitriol.
