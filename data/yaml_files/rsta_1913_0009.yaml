revised_title: 'Optical Rotatory Dispersion: Natural and Magnetic Rotatory Dispersion
  in Quartz of Light in the Visible Region of the Spectrum'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the natural and magnetic rotatory dispersion in quartz
  of light in the visible region of the spectrum, measuring the rotatory power for
  twenty-four wavelengths. They also test the validity of G. Wiedemann's Law of the
  proportionality between natural and magnetic rotatory dispersions.
