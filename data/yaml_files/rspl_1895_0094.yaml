revised_title: Investigating the Diurnal Periodicity of Earthquakes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Studies
tldr: The authors analyze earthquake data from various locations and find evidence
  of a diurnal periodicity in earthquake frequency. They also compare the epochs of
  this variation with those of barometric pressure and wind velocity, suggesting that
  wind velocity may be the primary cause of the diurnal periodicity in ordinary earthquakes,
  while barometric pressure may be responsible for after-shocks.
