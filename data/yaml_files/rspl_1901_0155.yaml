scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: This paper presents an experimental study on the vibrations of rifle barrels
  and their impact on shooting accuracy. The author, A. Mallock, discusses the historical
  background of the topic and compares his findings with previous research by Cranz
  and Koch. The results provide insights into the factors affecting ballistic deflection
  and contribute to the understanding of rifle barrel vibrations.
