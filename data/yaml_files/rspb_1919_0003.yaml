tldr: The study investigates the changes in blood pressure and blood volume in patients
  during and after operations. It shows that during the early stages of an operation,
  the pulse rate, systolic, and pulse pressures are raised, while the diastolic pressure
  is slightly raised, and the blood volume is probably increased. In the later stages
  or post-operative stage, blood pressures fall, and there is a blood concentration.
  The results indicate that the changes in blood pressure and blood volume are interdependent
  and can be explained by considering factors such as vasomotor tone, blood viscosity,
  and venous tone.
