revised_title: A Simple Method for Estimating Daylight Intensity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author proposes a simple method for approximating the intensity of total
  daylight using a rod and a hollow tube painted with a black spot. The observer slides
  the tube up the rod while looking at the spot, and the point at which it disappears
  indicates the intensity of the light. This method can be used to estimate changes
  in light during a solar eclipse.
