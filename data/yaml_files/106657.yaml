tldr: Edward Jenner's observations on the natural history of the Cuckoo reveal that
  the bird selects various small bird nests to lay its egg, often choosing the Hedge-sparrow
  as the foster parent. The Cuckoo's egg is incubated alongside the foster parent's
  eggs, and when hatched, the Cuckoo displaces the foster parent's offspring, leading
  to their death. Jenner also describes the behavior of the Cuckoo in displacing its
  fellow-nestlings and the reasons behind this seemingly unnatural phenomenon.
