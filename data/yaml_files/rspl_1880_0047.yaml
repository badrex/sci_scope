revised_title: Dielectric Capacity and Refractive Indices of Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the dielectric capacity and refractive indices of various
  liquids, including petroleum spirit, petroleum oil, ozokerit lubricating oil, turpentine,
  castor oil, sperm oil, olive oil, and neatsfoot oil. The results show that for hydrocarbons,
  the specific inductive capacity is equal to the square of the refractive index,
  while for animal and vegetable oils, this is not the case.
