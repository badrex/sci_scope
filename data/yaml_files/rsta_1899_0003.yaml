scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Probability
tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the normal distribution and correlation,
  providing formulae for testing the existence of these concepts in statistical data.
  The study focuses on cases with one attribute, assumed to be normally distributed,
  and two attributes, assumed to be normally correlated.
