revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Source of Voltaic Power
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: Faraday investigates the source of power in the Voltaic pile and experiments
  with various fluids and metallic combinations to determine whether the contact theory
  or chemical action is responsible for electrical power. He concludes that chemical
  action is the true source of voltaic power, disproving the contact theory.
