revised_title: The Effect of Animal Age on Mammalian Tissue Growth in Vitro
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Developmental Biology
tldr: This study investigates the effect of animal age on the growth of mammalian
  tissue in vitro. The results show that young tissues grow more extensively in old
  plasma, while young tissues in young plasma exhibit limited or no growth. This suggests
  that the age of the animal may play a role in the suitability of plasma as a culture
  medium for tissue growth.
