scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author examines the development and variations of the ciliary ganglion in
  Elasmobranchs, providing insights into its origin, relations, and homology. The
  study reveals that the ciliary ganglion is a sympathetic ganglion, similar to the
  relationship between the sympathetic ganglia of the trunk and the spinal nerves.
