revised_title: A Novel Method for Detecting Electrical Oscillations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Waves
tldr: The authors present a new method for detecting electrical oscillations by measuring
  the change in hysteresis using a magnetic detector. They demonstrate that the presence
  of oscillations increases hysteresis in the magnetic material, which can be used
  to detect and measure oscillations in electrical circuits.
