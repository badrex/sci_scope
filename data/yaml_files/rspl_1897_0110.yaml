revised_title: Thermal Conductivities of Single and Mixed Solids and Liquids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the thermal conductivities of various single and mixed
  solids and liquids, and their variation with temperature. The study reveals that
  solids and liquids generally decrease in conductivity with an increase in temperature,
  and the conductivity of a mixture lies between the conductivities of its constituents.
topics:
- Thermal Conductivity
- Temperature Dependence
- Heat Transfer
- Solid and Liquid Mixtures
- Thermo-Junctions
