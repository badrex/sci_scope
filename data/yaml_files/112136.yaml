  and Non-Vascular Textures of the Body
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The study investigates the rate at which crystalloids, specifically lithium
  salts, pass into and out of the vascular and non-vascular textures of the body in
  animals and humans. The research explores various analysis methods and their delicacy,
  as well as the presence of lithium in solid and liquid food.
