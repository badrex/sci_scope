revised_title: Magnetical Experiments and Observations on Metallic Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of various metallic substances,
  including iron, nickel, and brass, and discovers that hammering can make brass magnetic,
  even if it initially had no magnetism. The experiment also shows that heating brass
  to a red-hot temperature and then cooling it can remove its magnetic properties.
