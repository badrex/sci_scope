revised_title: Artificial Shell-Like Substance Formation in a Bleaching Factory
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Chemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates an artificial substance resembling shell found in a
  bleaching factory's machinery. The substance forms through a chemical deposition
  process involving lime and gelatine, similar to the materials used by molluscs in
  shell formation. The substance's properties, such as its iridescent lustre and laminated
  structure, are examined and compared to natural shells.
