tldr: In 1700, John Luffkin discovered large elephant bones in a gravel pit near Colchester,
  Essex. He discusses the possible origins of these bones, considering their size
  and comparing them to known elephant osteology. Luffkin suggests that the bones
  may have belonged to an elephant that died during Roman times in Britain.
