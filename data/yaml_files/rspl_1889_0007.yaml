revised_title: Magnetic Rotation of Plane Polarization in Doubly Refracting Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization in
  doubly refracting bodies, discovering that the effect is a periodic function of
  the length of the path of light in the medium. The study also reveals that the magnetic
  rotation diminishes as the doubly refracting property increases.
