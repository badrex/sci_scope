  Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: This paper investigates the magneto-optic phenomena of iron, nickel, and cobalt,
  presenting a theoretical analysis of the effects of magnetization on light propagation.
  The author develops equations to describe the reflection of light at the surface
  of a magnet and the transmission of light through magnetized metallic films, comparing
  the results with experimental findings.
topics:
- Magneto-Optics
- Iron
- Nickel
- Cobalt
- Electromagnetic Theory
