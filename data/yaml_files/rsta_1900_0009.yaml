revised_title: The Comparative Efficiency of Positively and Negatively Charged Ions
  as Condensation Nuclei
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the efficiency of positively and negatively charged
  ions as condensation nuclei and finds that negatively charged ions require a much
  smaller degree of supersaturation to cause water to condense, potentially explaining
  the preponderance of negatively electrified rain.
