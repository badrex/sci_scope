revised_title: Investigating the Causes of Diurnal Magnetic Needle Variations and
  Aurora Borealis
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, John Canton, investigates the causes of the regular and irregular
  diurnal variations of the horizontal magnetic needle and the connection with aurora
  borealis. He suggests that the attractive power of the magnet decreases while heating
  and increases while cooling, and that subterranean heat may be responsible for the
  irregular variations. The author also proposes that aurora borealis could be caused
  by the electricity of heated air above the earth.
