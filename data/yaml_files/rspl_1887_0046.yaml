scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hematology & Blood Disorders
tldr: The author discovers a new proteid substance in blood serum that significantly
  influences coagulation. This substance, called serum fibrinogen, increases the amount
  of fibrin formed when added to peptone plasma. It also prevents blood coagulation
  when injected into a living animal, suggesting its potential role in clotting disorders.
