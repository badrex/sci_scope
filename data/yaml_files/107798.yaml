revised_title: Chemical Analysis of Ancient Copper Alloys and their Corrosion
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author examines the changes that have occurred in ancient copper alloys,
  specifically bronze, through chemical analysis and observation. The study focuses
  on artifacts from Greece and the Mediterranean, including a helmet, a nail, a mirror,
  and coins. The author identifies the chemical compositions of the incrustations
  and rusts on these artifacts, and discusses the possible connections between the
  chemical composition and the texture of the artifacts.
