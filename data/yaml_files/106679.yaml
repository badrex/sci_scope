tldr: The author, B. Hutchinson, analyzes the rainfall data for the year 1788 and
  its impact on agriculture. Despite the significant decrease in rainfall, crops and
  fruit production remained plentiful due to mild temperatures and timely rain events.
  This study supports the assertion that drought does not always lead to a lack of
  agricultural produce in England.
