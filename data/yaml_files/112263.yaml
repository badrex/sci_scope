revised_title: Experimental Investigations on the Stratified Electrical Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author investigates the stratified appearance in electrical discharges and
  finds that varying the resistance in the circuit can modify the discharge's appearance,
  suggesting a relationship between resistance and the stratified phenomenon.
