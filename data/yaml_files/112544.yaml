revised_title: On the Combustion of Hydrogen and Carbonic Oxide in Oxygen under High
  Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author investigates the combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in oxygen
  under high pressure and discovers that dense gases and vapors become luminous at
  much lower temperatures than aeriform fluids of comparatively low specific gravity,
  regardless of the gas or vapor's nature.
