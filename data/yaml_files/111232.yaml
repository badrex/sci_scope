revised_title: The Role of Atmospheric Nitrogen and Ammonia in Plant Nutrition
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the role of atmospheric nitrogen and ammonia in plant
  nutrition through a series of experiments. He concludes that while plants absorb
  nitrogen from the air, ammonia in the atmosphere does not significantly contribute
  to plant growth. However, adding ammonia to the air can stimulate and modify vegetation,
  with varying effects depending on the timing of its introduction.
