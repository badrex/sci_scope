revised_title: 'The Pressure of Light Against the Source: The Recoil from Light'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors describe an experiment that demonstrates the pressure of light against
  its source, or the'recoil from light,' by measuring the radiation pressure on discs
  with varying reflection and absorption coefficients. They discuss the theoretical
  framework and present the experimental setup, including the vacuum system and light
  source, used to achieve this phenomenon.
