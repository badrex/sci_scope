  Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on a monkey to determine the role of the second
  dorsal nerve in controlling pupil dilation. They find that the dilator fibers of
  the iris are derived from the anterior root of the second dorsal nerve, providing
  insight into the nervous system's regulation of the eye's pupil.
