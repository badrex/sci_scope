revised_title: The Similarity in Nature of X- and Primary β-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the similarities between X-rays and primary β-rays,
  finding that softer rays have properties closer to X-rays, and that primary β-rays
  of radium E can excite characteristic X-radiations in metals. The study also reveals
  differences in absorption and scattering between X-rays and β-rays.
