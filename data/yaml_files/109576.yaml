revised_title: Further Observations on the Arrangement of Arteries in Slow-Moving
  Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, presents further findings on the connection between
  the disposition of blood vessels and the actions of muscles in slow-moving animals.
  He observes that the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, are more subdivided
  than other sets of arteries, suggesting a correlation between arterial branching
  and muscle function. This is supported by examples from various animals, including
  the human eye, the swimming bladder of fish, and the intestinum ileum of the Cavia
  Aguti.
