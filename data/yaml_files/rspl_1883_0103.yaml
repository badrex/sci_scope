revised_title: Elliptic Space Dynamics and Rigid Body Motion
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: This paper explores the motion of a rigid body in elliptic space, using non-Euclidean
  geometry concepts. The author demonstrates the duality and symmetry in elliptic
  space and extends the theory to solid geometry, kinematics, and the dynamics of
  a rigid body. The motion of a body is expressed in terms of six symmetrical angular
  velocities, and the theory of screws is also considered.
