revised_title: A New Approach to Correcting Field Curvature in Cassegrain Reflectors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a method to correct field curvature in Cassegrain reflectors
  while preserving achromatism and other desirable features. The approach involves
  using a combination of lenses and mirrors, with the potential to improve the performance
  of these telescopes.
