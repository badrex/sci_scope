scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of the humours of the eye,
  specifically the aqueous, vitreous, and crystalline humour. The study reveals that
  these humours are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate, with the
  basis of the aqueous humour being soda. The specific gravity and chemical properties
  of each humour are also examined and compared across different species.
