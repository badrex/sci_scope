revised_title: 'On the Partial Polarization of Light by Reflexion: A Study of Brewster''s
  Law'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the partial polarization of light by reflection and
  develops a formula to express the changes in the planes of polarization. The formula
  is applied to partially polarized rays and is found to be accurate in predicting
  the quantity of polarized light at different angles of incidence.
