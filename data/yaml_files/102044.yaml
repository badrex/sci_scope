scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author, Thomas Baker, presents a method for constructing equations using
  a circle and a parabola, offering a simpler and more universal approach to solving
  biquadratic and cubic equations. This method is based on the properties of parabolas
  and circles, and it provides a more efficient alternative to existing methods by
  Cartes, de Wit, and de la Hire.
