revised_title: 'Improvement of the Hessian Bellows: A Spiral Shape for Enhanced Airflow'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author, D. Papin, describes an improvement to the Hessian Bellows by changing
  the shape of the Tympanum to a spiral, which allows for better airflow and reduced
  friction. This new design can be used for wind and water applications and has potential
  for various other uses, such as coal-mine ventilation and furnace work.
