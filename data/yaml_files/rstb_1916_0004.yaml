revised_title: Effects of Functional Activity in Striated Muscle and the Submaxillary
  Gland
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Biophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the metabolic changes in striated muscle and the submaxillary
  gland during functional activity, focusing on oxygen consumption, blood flow, exudation
  from vessels, and changes in weight and specific gravity. They use a combination
  of experimental methods, including the measurement of blood flow, oxygen consumption,
  and haemoglobin values, to analyze the effects of prolonged exercise on muscle and
  glandular tissues.
