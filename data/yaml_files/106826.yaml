scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Phenomena & Observations
tldr: F. J. H. Wollaston describes a steady stream of light extending across the sky
  from west to east, resembling the tail of a comet. The light originated near Ceti
  and ascended in a straight line, making an angle with its course and proceeding
  in a vertical circle. Wollaston seeks information on whether this phenomenon has
  been observed elsewhere and in what direction.
