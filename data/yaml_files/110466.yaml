tldr: John V. Thompson's study demonstrates that the Pentacrinus Europaeus, a stationary
  marine creature, is the young form of the indigenous Comatula species. The transformation
  occurs as the Pentacrinus Europaeus detaches from its fixed position and evolves
  into a mobile, free-swimming form similar to the Comatula starfish.
