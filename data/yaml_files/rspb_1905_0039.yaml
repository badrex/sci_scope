tldr: The author investigates apospory in Nephrodium pseudo-mas var. cristata apospora,
  a fern that undergoes direct vegetative development from sporophyte to gametophyte
  without spores. The study examines the cytological features of apospory and compares
  the chromosome counts of prothalli and sporophytes, finding no reduction during
  the transition between generations.
