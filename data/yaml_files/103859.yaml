revised_title: Determination of Isochronal Pendulums' Lengths in Different Latitudes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Timekeeping
tldr: The authors investigate the difference in the lengths of isochronal pendulums
  in London and Jamaica to determine the impact of latitude on pendulum clocks. They
  find that the clock's pendulum lengthens by heat, affecting its performance in warmer
  climates.
