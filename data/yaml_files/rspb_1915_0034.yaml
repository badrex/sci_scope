tldr: This study investigates the inheritance of color variations in the stick-insect
  Carausius morosus. Researchers found that color patterns in adult females can be
  classified into 10 distinct categories, with green and brown pigments playing a
  significant role in color variation. The study also discovered that all newly hatched
  insects have a similar color pattern, and color changes occur as the insects develop.
