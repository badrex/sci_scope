revised_title: The Role of Impurities in the Adamkiewicz Reaction and the Chemistry
  of Glyoxylic Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The authors investigate the Adamkiewicz reaction and discover that the colored
  product is not solely due to the proteid molecule itself. Instead, they find that
  an impurity in the acetic acid plays a crucial role in the reaction, which has led
  to uncertainty in previous studies.
