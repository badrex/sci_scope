revised_title: Investigating the Mechanical Effect of Gradients on a Line of Railroad
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Railway & Transportation Engineering
tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, investigates the mechanical effects of gradients on
  a line of railroad, focusing on the influence of ascents and descents on the motion
  of a load drawn by a locomotive engine. He discusses the errors in previous estimations
  and presents a formula to compute the relative and absolute times of a train ascending
  a plane, as well as the ratio of forces expended in the process.
