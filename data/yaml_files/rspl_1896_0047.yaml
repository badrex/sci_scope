revised_title: Novaya Zemlya Eclipse Observations and Prismatic Camera Results
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: During the 1896 solar eclipse in Novaya Zemlya, J. Norman Lockyer and his team
  used a prismatic camera to capture valuable spectroscopic and coronagraph results.
  The photographs obtained showed interesting variations in the wavelengths of certain
  lines compared to previous eclipse observations. The team's findings are still being
  analyzed, with more detailed reports and discussions promised in a subsequent communication.
