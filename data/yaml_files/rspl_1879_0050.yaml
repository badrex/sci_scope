revised_title: 'Research on the Action of Organic Substances on Ultra-Violet Rays:
  Examination of Essential Oils'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the action of organic substances on ultra-violet rays
  and examine the spectra of various essential oils. They find that terpenes with
  a higher number of carbon atoms have increased absorptive power for more refrangible
  rays, and that dilution with alcohol can help detect the presence of aromatic compounds
  in essential oils.
