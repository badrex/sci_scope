revised_title: The Crystalline Structure of Iron at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the crystalline structure of iron at high temperatures
  and observe changes in the material's surface due to heating and strain. They find
  that the heated iron exhibits a system of interlacing lines, which they attribute
  to relative displacement of crystals and volume changes in the iron.
