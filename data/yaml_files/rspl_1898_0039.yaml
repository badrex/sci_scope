revised_title: Investigating the Magnetic Susceptibility of Liquid Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: Fleming and Dewar investigate the magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen using
  a unique experimental method. They find that liquid oxygen has a constant magnetic
  susceptibility, which is different from the susceptibility of air, indicating that
  it is a paramagnetic substance.
