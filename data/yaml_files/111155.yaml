revised_title: On Induced Magnetic Forces and Their Relation to Magnetic Induction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the principles of magnetic induction and induced magnetic
  forces, discovering that the limit of induced magnetic force varies with the magnetic
  conditions of the experiment. The study also reveals that magnetic induction is
  directly related to magnetic intensity and inversely related to the square of the
  distance between magnetic objects.
