revised_title: On the Independence of Stokes' Functional Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Applications
tldr: The author examines the relationship between two functional equations proposed
  by Sir George Stokes and demonstrates that they are not independent. The study focuses
  on the mathematical aspects of the equations and their implications in physical
  applications.
topics:
- Functional Equations
- Mathematical Analysis
