revised_title: Investigating the Electro-Chemical Preservation of Metals and the Effects
  of Motion on Copper Sheathing
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the electro-chemical preservation of metals and
  the effects of motion on copper sheathing. He finds that motion does not affect
  the nature of the protecting metal and that there is also a mechanical wear of the
  copper in sailing. He also examines the influence of imperfect or irregular conducting
  surfaces and the nature of the contact between the copper and the preserving metal.
