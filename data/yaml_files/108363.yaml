revised_title: Reproduction of Lost Parts in Myriapoda and Insecta
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Entomology
tldr: The author investigates the reproduction of lost parts in Myriapoda and Insecta,
  specifically focusing on the Iulidae species. Through a series of experiments, the
  author demonstrates that these insects can regenerate lost antennae and legs during
  their molting process. The regenerated parts are smaller and less perfect than the
  original ones, but still functional.
