revised_title: Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Expansion of Air and Its Impact
  on Temperature Variations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical expansion of air on temperature
  variations, particularly on high mountain summits and in the atmosphere. The experiments
  demonstrate that when air is mechanically expanded, it attracts or absorbs heat
  from surrounding bodies, leading to colder temperatures on mountain summits and
  in high-altitude regions.
