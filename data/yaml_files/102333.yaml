revised_title: A Strange Symptom of Hydrops Pectoris and Its Reason
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Pulmonology
tldr: The author describes a unique symptom of hydrops pectoris, where patients experience
  difficulty in breathing when sitting or standing but not when lying down. Upon dissection,
  both breast cavities were found to be filled with water, which pressed on the diaphragm,
  making breathing difficult. The author suggests that paracenthesis may be a viable
  treatment option in similar cases.
