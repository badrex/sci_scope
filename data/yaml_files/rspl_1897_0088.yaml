revised_title: The Effect of Very Low Temperatures on the Germination of Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of very low temperatures on the germination
  of various seeds, exposing them to temperatures between -183°C to -192°C. They found
  that the germinative power of the seeds remained unaffected, suggesting that life
  in resting seeds is not dependent on respiration and can withstand significant temperature
  changes.
