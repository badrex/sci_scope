revised_title: Molecular Changes in Iron Wire upon Heating and Cooling
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Material Properties
tldr: The author observes a momentary molecular change in iron wire when heated and
  then cooled. The wire elongates during cooling and contracts during heating. This
  phenomenon is not observed in other metals tested, suggesting a unique property
  of iron.
