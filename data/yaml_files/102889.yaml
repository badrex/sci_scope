tldr: The author provides a comprehensive review of David Gregory's 'Astronomiae Physicae
  & Geometricae Elementa,' a book that presents a systematic approach to physical
  and geometrical astronomy. The work covers the order, motion, and periods of primary
  planets, the phases of inferior planets, and the explanation of eclipses. It also
  examines various theories on celestial motion, including those of Kepler, Descartes,
  and Leibniz, and discusses the Prolemaic, Tychonic, and Semi-Tychonic systems. The
  book delves into the motion of the Primum Mobile, the use of globes and spheres,
  and the methods of determining the positions of stars. It also explores the theory
  of primary planets, the orbits of Earth and planets, and the calculation of their
  motions and tables.
