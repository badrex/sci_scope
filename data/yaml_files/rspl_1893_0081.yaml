revised_title: Experiments on Germination and Seed Viability in Various Environments
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the germination capabilities of
  seeds in various environments, including vacuum and different gases. The results
  show that neither vacuum nor specific gas atmospheres significantly affect the germination
  of the tested seeds, and plants grown from these seeds exhibit no deviations from
  their control counterparts.
