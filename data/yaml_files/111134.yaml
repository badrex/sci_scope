revised_title: Investigation of Rolling Motion and Pressure of a Cylinder
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the rolling motion and pressure of a cylinder, determining
  the time of rolling and oscillation, as well as the conditions for slipping and
  jumping. The study has practical applications in engineering, particularly for falsely-balanced
  carriage wheels and locomotive engines.
topics:
- Rolling Motion
- Cylinder Mechanics
- Pendulum Oscillation
- Friction and Slipping
- Engineering Applications
