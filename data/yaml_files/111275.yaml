  for Measuring Heart Movements'

tldr: The sphygmoscope is a newly invented instrument that can accurately measure
  the movements of the heart and blood vessels. It consists of a small chamber with
  a rubber wall that protrudes when the heart beats, causing a rise in a connected
  glass tube. This instrument can be used to determine the frequency, duration, and
  strength of heartbeats, and can detect even the slightest movements of the heart.
  It also allows for the observation of the effects of various factors, such as food,
  medicine, and respiration, on heart function.
