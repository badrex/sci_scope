  Classes of Nerve Fibers
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of nicotin on the peripheral ganglia and
  nerve fibers, discovering that it paralyzes the cells of the superior cervical ganglion
  and affects the function of various nerve fibers, including those responsible for
  pupil dilation, vaso-constriction, and gland secretion.
