revised_title: 'On the Polarization of Light by Refraction: Establishing the Laws
  and Formulas'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the polarization of light by refraction
  and establishes the laws and formulas governing this phenomenon. He demonstrates
  that the action of refracting surfaces changes the position of the planes of polarized
  light and provides experimental evidence to support his findings.
