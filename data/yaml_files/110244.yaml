  Large Instruments

scientific_subdiscipline: Telescope Design & Construction
tldr: Peter Barlow's paper discusses the performance of fluid refracting telescopes
  and their potential for large instruments. He compares his telescope with other
  telescopes, such as Mr. Herschel's and Sir James South's, and demonstrates its ability
  to resolve double stars and nebulae. Barlow also proposes an improvement in the
  construction of large telescopes using double object-lenses, which could lead to
  more powerful telescopes in the future.
