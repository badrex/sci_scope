revised_title: Innervation and Motor Control in Antagonistic Muscles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuroscience
tldr: This article investigates the reciprocal innervation of antagonistic muscles,
  specifically focusing on the orbicularis palpebrarum and levator palpebrce superioris
  muscles. The author examines the co-ordination of these muscles in the closure of
  the palpebral fissure and finds that blinking is a bilateral and symmetrical movement,
  while complete eye closure involves inhibition of the levator palpebrce superioris
  muscle on one side.
