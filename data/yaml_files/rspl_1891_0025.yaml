revised_title: On Singular Points and Lines in the Theory of Loci of Ultimate Intersections
  of a System of Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the properties of singular points and lines in the context
  of the theory of loci of ultimate intersections of a system of surfaces. The study
  focuses on rational and integral equations and their factors, which are connected
  to the envelope, conic node, biplanar node, and uniplanar node loci.
