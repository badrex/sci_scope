  and Gland Physiology'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of sectioning the chorda tympani nerve on
  the secretion of saliva in dogs, discovering that it causes a 'paralytic' secretion
  on the affected side and an 'antilytic' secretion on the opposite side. The study
  suggests that the central nervous system's secretory centers experience an increase
  in irritability, which affects the secretion of saliva.
