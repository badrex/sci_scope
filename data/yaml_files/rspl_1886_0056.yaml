revised_title: Thermal Properties and Vaporization of Ethyl Oxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the thermal properties and vaporization of ethyl oxide,
  finding that the saturated vapor has an abnormal density that increases with temperature
  and pressure. The authors also deduce the critical temperature, critical pressure,
  and volume of ethyl oxide at specific conditions.
