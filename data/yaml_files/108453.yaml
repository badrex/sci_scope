scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author analyzes thermometrical observations taken at the Royal Society and
  compares them to observations at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The study reveals
  a higher temperature in the vicinity of the River Thames, which is attributed to
  the urban heat island effect caused by the river and surrounding environment.
