revised_title: Anatomy and Hearing Mechanism of the Dugong
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the milk tusks and hearing organ of the dugong, a marine
  mammal, and compares its anatomy to that of the hippopotamus. The dugong's unique
  bony union of the ossicles with the skull suggests it relies more on bone vibrations
  for hearing than other aquatic animals.
