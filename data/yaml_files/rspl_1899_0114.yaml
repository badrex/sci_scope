revised_title: 'Imperviousness of Bacteria to Extreme Cold: Experiments with Liquid
  Air'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors expose various bacteria to the temperature of liquid air (-190Â°C)
  for seven days in a sealed environment. Despite the extreme cold and mechanical
  strain, no structural changes or impairment in bacterial vitality are detected,
  suggesting that bacteria can survive in extremely cold conditions.
