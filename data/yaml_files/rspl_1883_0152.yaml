tldr: The author analyzes the velocity of tsunami waves from the Krakatoa eruption
  and an earthquake in the Bay of Bengal, finding that the wave from Krakatoa traveled
  with a similar velocity to the wave from the earthquake. The study also highlights
  the importance of ocean depth in affecting wave velocity.
