revised_title: Optimal Muscle Geometry for Maximum Work in Quadrilateral Muscles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the geometry of quadrilateral muscles, specifically
  the pectineus muscle, to determine the conditions necessary for maximum work. Using
  Ptolemy's theorem, the author demonstrates that the muscle's sides and diagonals
  must meet specific conditions to achieve maximum work, providing a test for the
  truth of the postulate.
