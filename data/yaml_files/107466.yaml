revised_title: Debunking the Myth of Water Formation from Chlorine Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy refutes the claim that water is formed by the decomposition
  of chlorine during experiments involving muriatic acid gas and metals. He demonstrates
  that the water is derived from other sources, such as the action of the gas on the
  oxide of lead and alkali in the glass, and not from the decomposition of chlorine.
