revised_title: A New Method for Raising Water Using Quicksilver
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The authors describe a new hydraulic engine that uses quicksilver instead of
  leather to reduce friction and improve efficiency in water pumping. The engine raises
  water to a height of 27 feet in less than two minutes, offering a potential solution
  to the problems of traditional water-raising engines.
