revised_title: 'Effects of Anaesthetics on Protoplasm: Observations on Vegetable and
  Animal Protoplasm'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of anaesthetics, specifically carbon dioxide,
  ether, and chloroform, on both vegetable and animal protoplasm. They observe that
  carbon dioxide initially accelerates movement before causing a complete cessation,
  while ether and chloroform have more pronounced effects, causing temporary or permanent
  paralysis of the protoplasm.
