revised_title: Improvements in Percussion Shells and Grooved Shot
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Military & Weaponry
tldr: The author describes the development of percussion shells and grooved shot,
  which can be fired from a common gun. The grooved cylindrical balls are found to
  have a spiral motion and can be used to create shells that explode by percussion.
  Experiments with these shells show promising results, with successful explosions
  and the potential for increased range.
