revised_title: Investigation of the Crystalline Properties of Chlorine and Bromine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The authors investigate the crystalline properties of chlorine and bromine,
  discovering that both substances belong to the orthorhombic system. They also observe
  differences in their optical properties, such as pleochroism and absorption, which
  change with temperature.
