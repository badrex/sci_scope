  Cattle

scientific_subdiscipline: Agriculture & Plant Sciences
tldr: The author, Abbe Pluche, shares his observations on the smut of corn, the role
  of microorganisms in its development, and the behavior of birds attracted to grazing
  cattle. He uses a microscope to study the smut and its effects on corn stalks and
  grains, and he observes that birds, such as thrushes and starlings, seek worms in
  the soil near cattle, which may be attracted by the animals' movement and trampling.
