revised_title: Investigating the Static and Dynamic Effects of Voltaic Batteries
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: John P. Gassiot investigates the static and dynamic effects of voltaic batteries,
  discovering that the elements constituting the battery assume polar tension before
  the circuit is completed. He also finds that static effects precede and are independent
  of the completion of the voltaic circuit and chemical or dynamic action.
