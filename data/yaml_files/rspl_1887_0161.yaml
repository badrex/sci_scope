tldr: The author examines the brain and spinal cord structure of the Ceratodus Forsteri,
  a type of lungfish, and compares it to other vertebrates. The study reveals similarities
  and differences in the brain's size, ventricles, and the arrangement of cranial
  nerves, as well as the spinal cord's structure and the presence of a unique multiaxial
  fiber.
