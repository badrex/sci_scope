scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: This study investigates the cytomorphosis of the marsupial enamel-organ and
  its significance in the structure of the completed enamel. The author examines enamel
  fibrils, structures continuous with dentine tubules, and their role in enamel formation.
  The findings challenge previous theories on enamel formation and suggest a new understanding
  of enamel development in marsupials.
