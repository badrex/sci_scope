  Tar Leucoline'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: This article investigates the oxidation of cinchona chinoline and tar leucoline,
  exploring their chemical properties and reactions. The author discovers that both
  bases are related to the aromatic series and that tar leucoline is a mixture of
  at least two isomeric bases. The study contributes to the understanding of the composition
  and behavior of these compounds in organic chemistry.
