tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the moduli of elasticity, thermal
  capacity, and other physical constants in various metals. They find that the thermal
  capacity of all examined metals increases with temperature, and the rate of increase
  varies with the nature of the metal. The study also reveals a correlation between
  thermal expansibility, thermal capacity, and torsionability.
topics:
- Thermal Capacity
- Elasticity
- Thermal Expansibility
- Torsionability
- Physical Constants
