scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of iron in chromatin using micro-chemical
  methods and demonstrates that chromatin in every cell contains iron as a necessary
  constituent. The study focuses on amphibian cells, tissues, and organs, providing
  evidence for the wider distribution of iron in the body.
