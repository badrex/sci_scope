revised_title: 'Nitrogen Fixation by Bacteria in Soil: The Role of Azotobacter and
  Pseudomonas'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The authors investigate the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of Azotobacter and
  Pseudomonas bacteria in soil. They find that a mixed culture of these bacteria can
  increase soil nitrogen levels, with the potential to improve plant growth and agricultural
  productivity.
topics:
- Nitrogen fixation
- Azotobacter
- Pseudomonas
- Soil microbiology
- Bacterial ecology
