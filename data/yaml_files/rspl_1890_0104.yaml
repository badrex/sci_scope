revised_title: A Comprehensive Study of Salicyl-sulphonic Acid as a Test for Albumin
  and Other Proteids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the use of salicyl-sulphonic acid as a powerful precipitant
  and delicate reagent for detecting albumin and other proteids in various solutions.
  The study demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying minute amounts of proteids
  in egg white, serum, and other proteid sources, making it a valuable tool in scientific
  research and medical diagnostics.
