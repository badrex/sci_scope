tldr: The authors discuss the Abelian system of differential equations and their rational
  and integral algebraic integrals. They also explore the periodicity of Abelian functions,
  demonstrating their periodic nature and determining their periods.
topics:
- Abelian Integrals
- Abelian Functions
- Differential Equations
- Algebraic Integrals
- Periodicity
