revised_title: Observations on Hybernation and its Effects on Respiration and Body
  Temperature in Mammals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Behavior
tldr: The author investigates the state of hybernation in mammals, observing the diminished
  respiration and body temperature in hedgehogs, dormice, and bats. The study reveals
  that the sleep of hybernating animals varies from ordinary sleep, with a more impaired
  state of respiration and heat evolution, and increased ability to withstand the
  absence of atmospheric air.
