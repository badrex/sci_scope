revised_title: Experiments on Fluid Resistance and the Vibrations of a Golden Ball
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Acoustics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the resistance of fluids and the
  behavior of a golden ball in water and mercury. The results show that the ball's
  vibrations in mercury are similar to those in water, and the resistance of fluids
  affects the ball's fall time.
