revised_title: Determination of Adiabatic Relations of Gaseous Ether
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of gaseous ether as it approaches the liquid
  state when heated adiabatically. They determine the ratio between specific heats
  at constant pressure and volume, and find that these values change with varying
  volume, pressure, and temperature.
