revised_title: Investigating the Polarization of Light Emitted by Heated Tourmaline
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts an experiment using a heated tourmaline crystal and discovers
  that the light emitted by the crystal is partially polarized in a direction perpendicular
  to the plane of polarization of the light transmitted by the crystal. This finding
  supports the theory of exchanges and provides insight into the nature of light emitted
  by heated bodies.
