revised_title: Electrical Conductivity and Electrolysis in Chemical Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between electrical conductivity and
  chemical composition in various chemical compounds, particularly focusing on liquefied
  gases. The study reveals that some compounds, like liquid ammonia, conduct electricity
  well and undergo electrolysis, while others, such as liquid carbonic acid, do not.
