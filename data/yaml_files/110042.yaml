revised_title: On the Mechanical Applications of Condensed Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy explores the mechanical properties of liquids formed by gas
  condensation, focusing on their elasticity and potential applications. He demonstrates
  that certain gases, like sulfur dioxide and muriatic acid, can exert immense pressure
  when compressed and heated, suggesting their use as mechanical agents.
