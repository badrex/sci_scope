revised_title: Influence of Spinal Marrow on the Action of the Heart in Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: William Clift conducted experiments on fish to determine the influence of spinal
  marrow on heart action. He found that muscles can function without the brain and
  heart, but lose power when the spinal marrow is destroyed. The heart's action continues
  after the brain and spinal marrow are damaged, and injuries to the brain or spinal
  marrow can temporarily affect heart rate.
