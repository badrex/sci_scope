revised_title: The Structure and Function of Gastric Gland Pigments in Mollusca and
  Decapod Crustacea
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the structure and function of the gastric gland in mollusca
  and decapod crustacea, focusing on the pigment enterochlorophyll. They find that
  the pigment is a chlorophyll derivative, primarily taken up from the intestine and
  deposited in the gastric gland. The author also discusses the excretion process
  and the role of leucocytes in transporting substances within the gland.
topics:
- Gastric Gland Structure
- Enterochlorophyll
- Histology of Digestive Gland
- Spectrophotometry
- Pigment Analysis
