revised_title: 'Influence of Protozoa on Soil Bacteria: Further Observations and Methods'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between protozoa and soil bacteria
  by partially sterilizing soil and inoculating it with protozoa and bacteria-free
  amoeba cysts. The results show that the introduction of large numbers of bacteria
  into the soil alongside protozoa can cause disturbance to the bacterial flora, and
  the author aims to eliminate this source of experimental error.
