revised_title: Investigating the Boiling Points of Saturated Aqueous Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the boiling points of various saturated aqueous solutions
  and propose a method for determining the boiling point of a solution under standard
  atmospheric pressure. They also calculate barometer coefficients for each salt,
  which represent the effect of a rise in barometric pressure on the temperature equilibrium
  of the solution.
topics:
- Boiling points
- Saturated solutions
- Aqueous solutions
