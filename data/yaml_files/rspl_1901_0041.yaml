revised_title: 'Further Observations on Nova Persei: Changes in the Spectrum and Possible
  Rotations or Spiral Movements'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author observes changes in the spectrum of Nova Persei, noting a decrease
  in brightness and modifications in the hydrogen lines. The observations suggest
  possible rotations or spiral movements of distinct sets of particles with velocities
  of 500 and 100 miles per second.
