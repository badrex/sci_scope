  Sexual Characteristics and Hormone Development'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Development
tldr: This study investigates the effects of castration and ovariotomy on sheep, focusing
  on the development of secondary sexual characteristics and hormone growth. The results
  show that castration in early life inhibits the growth of horns and alters the general
  conformation of the body, while ovariotomy in females may lead to the assumption
  of male-like characteristics.
