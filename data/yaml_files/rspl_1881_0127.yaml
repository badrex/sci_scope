revised_title: On the Disappearance of Some Spectral Lines and Variations of Metallic
  Spectra Due to Mixed Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the disappearance of spectral lines and variations in
  metallic spectra when mixed vapours are present. They observe that the presence
  of a mixture of molecules of different elements affects the respective vibrations,
  leading to changes in spectral line intensities and appearances.
