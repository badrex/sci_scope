revised_title: On the Comparison of Electrostatic and Electromagnetic Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author compares electrostatic and electromagnetic forces and measures the
  ratio between the two units of electricity. The results reveal that the velocity
  of electromagnetic waves is significant and independent of the standards of length,
  time, and mass.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Electrostatics
- Electromagnetic Force
- Electrical Units
- Velocity of Electromagnetic Waves
