revised_title: On the Theory of the Orientation of the Oscillatory Plane of the Simple
  Pendulum and Its Application to the Search for the Flattening of the Earth's Spheroid
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents a formula to express the deviation of a free pendulum in
  terms of latitude and difference of meridians or hour-angle, assuming the Earth
  to be a sphere. The author infers that any deviation from this formula could be
  due to the ellipticity of the Earth, and investigates a formula geometrically to
  express the ellipticity in terms of such difference.
