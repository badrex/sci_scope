revised_title: Long-Period Determination of the Rate of Production of Helium from
  Radium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the rate of helium production from radium over an extended
  period using a sealed bulb and a McLeod gauge. The experiment reveals a rate of
  0.463 cubic millimeters of helium per gram of radium per day, with potential variations
  due to the action of radium emanation on organic materials.
