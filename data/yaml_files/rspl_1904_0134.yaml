revised_title: The Cause of the Period of Chemical Induction in the Union of Hydrogen
  and Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the cause of the induction period in the reaction between
  hydrogen and chlorine. They find that the presence of impurities, such as ammonia
  and sulfur dioxide, is responsible for the induction period, rather than the formation
  of an unstable intermediate compound.
