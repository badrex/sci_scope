tldr: The author presents a general method for reducing dynamics problems to the study
  of the principal function, a central relation that can be used to determine the
  integrals of motion and the equations of motion for transformed coordinates. The
  method is applied to various examples, including a ternary or multiple system with
  one predominant mass.
