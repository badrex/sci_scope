revised_title: Discovery of a New Rhinoceros Species in Africa and Its Fossil Resemblances
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The author describes a new species of rhinoceros found in Africa, whose skull
  closely resembles that of fossilized rhinoceros skulls from Siberia and other countries.
  This discovery raises the possibility that some supposedly extinct species may have
  simply retreated to uninhabited parts of the globe. The small skull capacity of
  the rhinoceros is discussed in relation to its limited intellect and difficulty
  in taming the animal.
