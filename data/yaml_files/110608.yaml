revised_title: Improving the Manufacturing Process of Sulphuric Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Equilibria
tldr: The author investigates the concentration of sulphuric acid required to balance
  its affinity for water and the evaporating force of a vacuum. He also explores the
  effect of atmospheric pressure on the evaporation of water from dilute sulphuric
  acid and suggests improvements to the manufacturing process.
