tldr: Faraday investigates the principles of induction and inductive capacity, concluding
  that induction is an action of contiguous particles and that different insulators
  have different inductive capacities. He also explores the effects of dielectric
  materials on induction and the phenomenon of residual charge in Leyden jars.
