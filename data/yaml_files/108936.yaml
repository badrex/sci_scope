revised_title: Investigating the Calorific Power and Invisible Rays of the Electric
  Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the calorific power and invisible rays emitted by the
  electric light using a thermoelectric pile and a rock-salt train. The results show
  that the heating power of the invisible rays is much higher than the visible rays,
  and the maximum heating power occurs beyond the red end of the spectrum.
