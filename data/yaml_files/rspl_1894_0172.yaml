revised_title: 'Investigating Diselectrification of Air: Experimentation and Apparatus'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the process of diselectrification of air using various
  experimental setups and apparatus. They discover that the efficiency of filters
  and appliances in removing electrification from air is limited, and that cotton-wool
  can significantly enhance the diselectrification effect.
