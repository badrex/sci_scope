revised_title: Measurement of Dielectric Constants Using Oscillations of Ellipsoids
  and Cylinders in a Field of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors present a method for measuring dielectric constants using oscillations
  of ellipsoids and cylinders in an electrostatic field. The method involves suspending
  the insulating material between flat plates connected to an alternating transformer
  and observing the period of small swings. This method is capable of high accuracy
  and provides results that agree with previous determinations.
