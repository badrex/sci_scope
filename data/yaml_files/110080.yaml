revised_title: Temperature Effects on Magnetic Forces and Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial
  Magnetic Intensity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's experiments reveal that as temperature increases, the
  intensity of magnetic forces decreases. He also discusses the diurnal variation
  of terrestrial magnetic intensity and suggests questions for further observation
  and research.
