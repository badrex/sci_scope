revised_title: Investigation of Liquid Hydrogen's Boiling Point Under Reduced Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the boiling point of liquid hydrogen under reduced pressure
  using a resistance thermometer. The results show that the boiling point is lowered,
  but the observed temperature is higher than expected, leading to questions about
  the thermometer's accuracy and the efficiency of heat isolation.
