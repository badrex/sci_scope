revised_title: An Investigation into the Cochlea's Typical Form and Variations
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This study examines the dimensions and variations of the cochlea in mammals,
  confirming the typical number of turns as 2.5 and revealing a lack of correlation
  between the number of turns and other cochlear dimensions. The research also identifies
  a correlation between cochlear size and the rate of curvature, suggesting that larger
  cochleae have a smaller diameter in the second whorl compared to the first.
