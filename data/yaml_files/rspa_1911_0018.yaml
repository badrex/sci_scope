revised_title: Energy Distribution of Scattered Röntgen Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the energy distribution of scattered Röntgen radiation
  and provide a method to calculate the number of electrons in an atom. They determine
  the energy of scattered Röntgen radiation by comparing the intensity of the scattered
  radiation from a given radiator in a fixed plane and the distribution of the scattered
  radiation around the radiator.
