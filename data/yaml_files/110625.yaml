tldr: Charles Darwin investigates the formation of the parallel roads and shelves
  in Glen Roy and Lochaber, concluding that they were formed by a marine origin. He
  argues that the land underwent gradual elevation, and the valleys were occupied
  by arms of a sea subject to tides, which gradually subsided as the land rose. This
  theory is supported by various details in the structure of the glens, such as the
  extent of corrosion, the quantity of shingle, and the succession of terraces.
