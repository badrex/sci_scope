tldr: Captain Sir E. Belcher's observations and measurements of tides at Otaheite
  (Tahiti) provide valuable data on the island's tidal patterns and the effectiveness
  of his tide gauge and batten devices. The study reveals two irregular moments of
  high water during each 24-hour period, with a range of 10 A.M. to 2h 27m P.M. or
  nearly 4h 27m by day and 31 20m by night.
