revised_title: Investigating Antelope as a Reservoir for the Virus of Sleeping Sickness
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if antelope can act as a reservoir
  for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that antelope
  can be infected by laboratory-bred and infected Glossina palpalis, but they do not
  transmit the infection to other susceptible animals effectively. This suggests that
  antelope may not be a significant reservoir for the virus.
