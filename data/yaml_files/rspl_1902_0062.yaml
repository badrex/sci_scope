tldr: This study investigates the connection between the physiological state and reactions
  of the two retinae in binocular vision. The author examines the 'flicker' method
  of photometry to measure any differences in physiological luminosity between binocular
  and uniocular vision of a given illuminated object, providing insights into the
  nature of the connection between retinal 'identical spots'.
