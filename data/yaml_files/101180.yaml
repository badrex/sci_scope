scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Chemistry & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author discusses the possibility of hidden qualities in the air, such as
  exotic effluviums from beneath the Earth's surface and celestial bodies. He presents
  observations and experiments to support his conjectures, suggesting that these effluviums
  may have an impact on various natural phenomena and the preservation of substances
  in a vacuum.
