revised_title: 'Occlusion of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Platinum Black: Thermal Changes
  and Gas Interactions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the occlusion of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum black,
  examining the heat evolved during the process and the behavior of various gases.
  They develop a method to measure the heat of occlusion and discuss the nature of
  gas occlusion by metals, with implications for electrical experiments using platinum
  or platinized electrodes.
topics:
- Platinum Black
- Occlusion of Gases
- Heat of Occlusion
- Calorimetry
- Thermal Changes
