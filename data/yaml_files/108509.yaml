revised_title: On the Magnetic Properties of Crystals and the Influence of Molecular
  Arrangement on Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of various crystals and the
  influence of molecular arrangement on forces. The study reveals that the force determining
  the position of the optic axes in a magnetic field is not independent of the crystal's
  magnetism or diamagnetism, and that the molecular structure of a substance affects
  its interaction with forces.
