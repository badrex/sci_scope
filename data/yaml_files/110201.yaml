revised_title: Investigating the Retardation of Pendulum Vibrations in Different Gases

scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Mechanics
tldr: Edward Sabine investigates the effect of air pressure and gas composition on
  the vibrations of an invariable pendulum. He finds that the previously calculated
  reduction to a vacuum for the pendulum's vibration in air is 41 vibrations greater
  than previously thought, and that hydrogen gas causes less retardation than air,
  indicating an inherent property in elastic fluids similar to viscosity in liquids.
