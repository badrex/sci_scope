scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolytes
tldr: The author presents a new voltaic arrangement called the Dissected Battery,
  which provides a constant current of electricity for extended periods, overcoming
  the variability issue of common batteries. The Dissected Battery consists of ten
  glass cells, allowing for the connection and comparison of various voltaic phenomena,
  and offers a clearer understanding of the underlying principles of voltaic combinations.
