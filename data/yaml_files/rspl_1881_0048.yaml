revised_title: Stresses Caused in the Earth's Interior by the Weight of Continents
  and Mountains
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: The author investigates the stresses caused in the Earth's interior by the weight
  of continents and mountains, using mathematical calculations and considering the
  Earth as a homogeneous, incompressible elastic sphere. The study reveals that the
  stress-difference at the center of the Earth is eight times greater than on the
  surface, and that the Earth's materials must have a strength similar to granite
  at least 1,000 miles below the surface.
