revised_title: Investigation of Stress-Optical Coefficient and Dispersion of Artificial
  Double Refraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the stress-optical coefficient and dispersion of artificial
  double refraction in various glasses, including borosilicates, using a new experimental
  method. They find that the coefficient is influenced by the glass's chemical composition
  and that the dispersion of double refraction is roughly proportional to the stress-optical
  coefficient.
