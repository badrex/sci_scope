  Speech
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: Charles Bell investigates the structure and functions of nerves involved in
  respiration and speech, proposing a new arrangement of the nervous system based
  on their distinctions. He demonstrates that these nerves differ in structure and
  sensibility, and that understanding their roles can lead to a better understanding
  of the overall nervous system.
