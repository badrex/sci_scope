revised_title: 'The Reduction Division in Ferns: A Study of Spore Formation and Chromosome
  Behavior'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates spore formation in ferns and examines the reduction
  division process. They find that the number of chromosomes in the spore mother-cells
  is 32, and the reduction division follows the Mendelian hypothesis, providing evidence
  for the universal occurrence of a reduction division in plants and animals.
