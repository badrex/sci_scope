tldr: The authors present an observation of the occultation of Venus by the Moon,
  conducted by Mr. John Bradley at Greenwich. The observation was made possible by
  a six-foot reflector, great magnifying power, and a serene atmosphere free from
  smoke. The results show a near agreement with previous observations by Dr. Bevis.
