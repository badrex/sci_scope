revised_title: 'Ion Mobilities in Gases and Vapors: The Influence of Electric Intensity
  and Pressure'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the mobility of ions produced by X-rays in various gases
  and vapors, finding that mobility is inversely proportional to pressure and that
  there is no direct relation between mobilities and molecular weights. They also
  propose a theoretical expression for ion mobility based on the kinetic theory of
  gases.
