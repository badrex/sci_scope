revised_title: Determination of the Heat Capacity and Heat of Fusion of Substances
  to Test the Validity of Person's Absolute Zero
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The author investigates the heat capacity and heat of fusion of various substances
  to test Person's theory of absolute zero. The results show that the temperature
  of no crystallization is not a constant for all materials, challenging Person's
  initial findings.
topics:
- Heat Capacity
- Heat of Fusion
- Solid-Liquid Phase Transitions
- Thermal Properties of Materials
- Temperature of No Crystallization
