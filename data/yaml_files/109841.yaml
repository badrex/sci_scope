scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: Charles Babbage's essay explores the inverse methods of calculus, specifically
  focusing on determining the value of an unknown function using functional equations.
  He aims to find a way to solve for a function given an equation, rather than finding
  a quantity from a known function, as is done in the direct method.
