  and Mountains
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the stresses caused in the Earth's interior by the weight
  of continents and mountains, using mathematical analysis and considering the elasticity
  and compressibility of the Earth's materials. The study provides insights into the
  forces shaping the Earth's surface and the potential impact of these forces on the
  planet's stability.
