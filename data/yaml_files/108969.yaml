revised_title: Experimental Researches in Magneto-Electricity and Dynamic Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between static and dynamic forces,
  particularly in electromagnetism and magneto-electricity. They describe a new generator
  of dynamic electricity and discuss the paradoxical phenomena that arise from Faraday's
  discovery of magneto-electric induction.
