revised_title: 'Vapour-Density of Bromine at High Temperatures: A Further Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the vapour-density of bromine at high temperatures,
  finding that it remains normal up to 1050Â°C, contrary to previous findings by J.
  J. Thomson. They use a modified method to fill a porcelain globe with bromine vapour
  and measure its density at various temperatures.
