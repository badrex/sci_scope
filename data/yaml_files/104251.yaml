revised_title: An Experiment to Prove the Elasticity of Water Compared to Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to demonstrate that water is more elastic than
  air when agitated by fire. He uses a digester to heat water and air under controlled
  conditions, observing explosions and the behavior of corked phials to support his
  findings.
