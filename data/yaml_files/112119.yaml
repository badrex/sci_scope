revised_title: Insolation and Atmospheric Moisture in Indian Meteorology
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between insolation and atmospheric
  moisture in Indian meteorology. He compares insolation differences in various locations
  and seasons, finding that insolation is greatly dependent on relative humidity.
  The study supports a connection between the presence of aqueous vapor in its transparent
  state and insolation, in line with Professor Tyndall's findings.
