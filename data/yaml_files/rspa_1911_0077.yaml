revised_title: An Investigation into the Adherence of Flat Surfaces and the Role of
  Liquid Films
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the adherence of flat surfaces, specifically steel surfaces,
  and discover that the primary cause of adhesion is the presence of a liquid film
  between the surfaces. They also find that atmospheric pressure has a minimal effect
  on the adhesion force.
