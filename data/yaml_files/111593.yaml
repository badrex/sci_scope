scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This paper examines the resistance and strength of various types of glass, including
  flint-glass, green glass, and crown-glass, in both globes and cylinders. The author
  investigates the effects of external and internal pressure, as well as the glass's
  tenacity, resistance to compression, and resistance to bursting. The study provides
  valuable insights into the mechanical properties of glass and its applications in
  various industries.
