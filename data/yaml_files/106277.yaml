tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, investigates the role of respiration and blood
  in gas exchange. He concludes that respiration is a phlogistic process affecting
  air, and the lungs' primary function is to facilitate gas exchange between the blood
  and air, with blood acting as a fluid that absorbs and releases phlogiston.
