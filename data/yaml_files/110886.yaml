revised_title: Voltaic Action of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Hydrocarbons in Gas Batteries
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Batteries
tldr: The author, William Robert Grove, investigates the voltaic action of phosphorus,
  sulphur, and hydrocarbons in gas batteries. He discovers that these non-conductive
  solids can be made to generate a continuous voltaic current when suspended in various
  gases and associated with oxygen. This finding expands the range of materials that
  can be used in voltaic combinations and helps to determine their electrochemical
  relations.
