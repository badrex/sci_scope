revised_title: 'Chemical Pigments in Pierid Butterflies: A Study of Lepidotic Acid
  and Related Substances'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical pigments in Pierid butterflies, specifically
  focusing on lepidotic acid and related uric acid derivatives. The study demonstrates
  the identity of natural and artificial pigments and discusses their probable constitution.
  The author also observes that these pigments are unique to the Pierid group among
  Rhopalocera and that different pigments are used in mimicry between different butterfly
  species.
