revised_title: 'Researches towards Establishing a Theory of the Dispersion of Light:
  Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the refractive index and the wavelength
  of light, comparing the results of Cauchy's wave theory with observed data from
  various transparent materials. The study finds close agreement between the theoretical
  and observed values, providing a satisfactory extension of the theory to new cases.
