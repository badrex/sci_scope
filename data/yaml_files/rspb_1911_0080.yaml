revised_title: The Role of Micronucleus in Regeneration of Infusorian Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the role of the micronucleus in the regeneration of
  infusorian organisms, specifically Stylonychia mytilus. The study shows that in
  the regeneration process, multiplication of micronuclei may occur, leading to a
  regenerated individual with more micronuclei than the typical number for the species.
