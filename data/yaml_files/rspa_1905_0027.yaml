revised_title: Magnetic Properties of Heusler Alloys
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic properties of Heusler alloys, specifically
  copper, aluminum, and manganese, and measure their magnetic constants. They find
  that these alloys have unique magnetic properties and present a magnetization curve
  for the analyzed alloy.
