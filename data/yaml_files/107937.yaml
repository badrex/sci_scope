revised_title: A Simplified Table for Suspension Bridge Computations
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering
tldr: Davies Gilbert presents a simplified table for calculating tensions and deflections
  in suspension bridges, supplementing the mathematical theory of suspension bridges
  previously published in 1826. The table offers a more efficient method for practical
  investigations and covers a range of bridge designs and configurations.
