revised_title: On the Capacity for Heat of Water between Freezing and Boiling Points
  and Determination of Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The authors investigate the capacity for heat of water between freezing and
  boiling points using a continuous-flow method of calorimetry. They determine the
  mechanical equivalent of heat in terms of international electrical units and provide
  a comprehensive series of measurements over the entire temperature range.
topics:
- Calorimetry
- Heat Capacity
- Specific Heat
- Thermal Units
- Continuous-Flow Method
