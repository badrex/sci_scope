revised_title: An Analytical Study of Boomerangs and Their Flight Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerodynamics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the flight mechanics of boomerangs, focusing on their
  aerodynamics and the role of air pressure in their flight. The study provides insights
  into the design and behavior of boomerangs, including their twisting and rounding
  features, and the factors that contribute to their return flight.
