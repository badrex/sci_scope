scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Microbiology
tldr: This study examines the relationship between protozoa, bacteria, and soil fertility.
  The authors find that protozoa play a crucial role in controlling bacterial populations,
  which in turn affects ammonia production and soil fertility. The findings suggest
  that protozoa may be a limiting factor in soil fertility.
