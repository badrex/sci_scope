tldr: Luke Howard presents tables of the variation in barometer height, temperature,
  and rainfall over nine years, showing connections with lunar apsides and prevailing
  winds. He concludes that the moon's perigee brings southern atmosphere, lowering
  air density, raising temperature, and increasing rainfall, while the apogee brings
  a freer influx of northern air, higher barometer, lower temperature, and less rain.
