tldr: Smithson Tennant analyzes the composition of emery, a hard mineral used for
  grinding and polishing, and compares it to diamond spar. Through a series of experiments,
  he finds that emery and diamond spar have similar compositions, with both containing
  a high percentage of argillaceous earth and siliceous materials, and a lower percentage
  of iron. The hardness of emery is found to be equal to that of diamond spar, suggesting
  that they are essentially the same substance, with emery often containing a larger
  proportion of iron.
