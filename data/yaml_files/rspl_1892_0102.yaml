revised_title: The Effect of Electric Stimulation on Brain Temperature and Its Implications
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the temperature changes in the brain and muscles during
  and after electric stimulation. They find that the brain's temperature rises and
  remains elevated for a longer time than muscles, suggesting that the brain has a
  higher calorific demand. This research may help in understanding the mechanisms
  of life and the effects of stimulant remedies.
