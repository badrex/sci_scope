tldr: M. Janssen reports on his observations of the solar eclipse of December 1871
  at Sholoor, noting a complex spectrum in his telescope. He confirms the existence
  of matter in the vicinity of the sun, responsible for emission, absorption, and
  polarization phenomena during total eclipses. Janssen also identifies an extremely
  rare hydrogen-based atmosphere extending beyond the chromosphere and supplying the
  same matter to the protuberances.
