revised_title: Properties and Potential Uses of Brazilian Vegetable Wax
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Chemistry & Polymer Science
tldr: The author investigates a vegetable wax from Brazil, known as Carnauba wax,
  and examines its properties and potential uses. The wax is found to be insoluble
  in water, but dissolves in alcohol and ether. It can be used in candles and has
  a melting point of 206Â°F. Further experiments reveal that the wax can be altered
  by exposure to light, acids, and alkalis, but its properties remain largely unchanged.
