revised_title: Comparing Barograph Records at Oxford and Kew Observatory
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This article compares the barograph records at Oxford and Kew observatories
  during various storms, finding that changes in pressure at Oxford are followed by
  similar changes at Kew, but nearly an hour later. The author suggests that increasing
  the number of stations and incorporating thermographs and anemometers could improve
  our understanding of atmospheric disturbances.
