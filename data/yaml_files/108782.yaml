revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Sugar in the Liver and its Relation
  to Post-Mortem Blood Analysis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the formation of sugar in the liver and challenges the
  widely accepted glycogenic theory. They find that blood collected from the right
  side of the heart during life contains a much lower amount of sugar than previously
  believed, and question the validity of using post-mortem blood analysis to determine
  the liver's sugar-forming function.
