revised_title: The Scattering of Light by Air and the Photosynthesis of Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the scattering of light by air and its relation to the
  photosynthesis of organic compounds. They find that the scattered light is almost
  completely polarized and that the blue color of the sky is due to the scattering
  by air molecules. The study also explores the formation of nitrites from nitrates
  in aqueous solutions and their assimilation by green leaves in sunlight.
