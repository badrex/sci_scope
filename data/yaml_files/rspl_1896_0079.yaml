revised_title: The Discovery of Zeeman Effect and its Connection with Electrons
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author discusses the influence of a magnetic field on radiation frequency,
  specifically the broadening of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field.
  This phenomenon, known as the Zeeman effect, is explained through the interaction
  of electrons and the ether, providing evidence for the existence of electrons and
  their role in atomic structure.
