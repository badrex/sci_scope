revised_title: 'The Effect of Magnetic Field on Torsional Oscillations in Nickel and
  Iron Wires: Influence of Drawing, Annealing, and Strain'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the rate of subsidence
  of torsional oscillations in nickel and iron wires. They find that the hardness
  of the metal, drawing, annealing, and strain significantly affect the response to
  the magnetic field, with permanent strain and annealing having a similar impact
  on nickel wires.
