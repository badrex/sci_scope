revised_title: Investigating Organism Production in Closed Vessels with Heated Air
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if organisms can be produced in
  closed vessels containing vegetable matter and water in an atmosphere of heated
  air. Out of ten experiments, three with pea-meal, two with hay, and four with coarse
  flour, five yielded positive results with moving organisms found in the vessels.
