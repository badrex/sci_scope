revised_title: Numerical Representation of Elective Attractions and Double Decompositions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Electrochemistry
tldr: Thomas Young presents a numerical table of elective attractions and discusses
  the sequences of double decompositions. He argues that attractive forces can be
  represented by numbers and that these numbers can be used to arrange chemical phenomena
  in an orderly manner. This approach allows for the comparison of a multitude of
  scattered phenomena and helps detect errors in common tables.
