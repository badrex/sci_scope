scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the motion of ether near the Earth and its connection
  with gross matter, discussing the effects of aberration and the behavior of waves
  and rays in a moving medium. The study includes new experiments and a detailed analysis
  of the impact of dense media on the motion of ether and light.
topics:
- Aberration
- Ether
- Refraction
- Interference
