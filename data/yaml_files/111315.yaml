revised_title: 'Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion: A Study on Air Temperature and
  Velocity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: Joule and Thomson investigate the thermal effects of fluids in motion, specifically
  air, and find that the temperature of air decreases as it moves through narrow passages
  due to the increase in velocity. They also explore the relationship between the
  velocity of air and the velocity of sound, and discuss the limitations of their
  findings.
