tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the length
  of the seconds pendulum in London and Paris. Using two invariable pendulums, Sabine
  compared the rates of the pendulums in both cities, finding that the pendulum in
  London had a slightly shorter length than the one in Paris.
