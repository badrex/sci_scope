scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Edward Frankland investigates the reaction of zincethyl and zincmethyl with
  binoxide of nitrogen, resulting in the formation of a new series of organic acids
  containing nitrogen. He explores the properties and reactions of these acids, including
  dinitroethylic acid and dinitromethylic acid, and their corresponding salts.
