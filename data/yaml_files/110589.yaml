revised_title: Experimental Researches on Dielectric Materials and the Differential
  Inductometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Faraday describes experiments to determine the specific inductive capacities
  of dielectric materials using a novel apparatus called the Differential Inductometer.
  The device allows for precise measurements of dielectric properties, including those
  of small masses like crystals and diamonds.
