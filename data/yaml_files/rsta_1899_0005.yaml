revised_title: An Investigation of the Gravitational Action Between Quartz Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Crystallography
tldr: The authors conduct an experiment to search for a directive action between two
  quartz crystals, using a torsion balance. They find no evidence of a significant
  directive action, and the inverse-square law holds true in the vicinity of the crystals.
