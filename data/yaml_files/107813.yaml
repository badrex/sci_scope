tldr: Charles Babbage presents a notation system for representing the action of machinery,
  allowing for easier understanding and analysis of complex mechanical systems. The
  system involves assigning names to moving parts, connecting the notation to the
  machine's drawings, indicating velocities, and representing the transmission of
  motion through arrows. This method aids in the identification of adjustments and
  the order in which they should be made.
