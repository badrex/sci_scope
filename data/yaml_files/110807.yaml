revised_title: The Role of Lymphatic Vessels in the Body's Absorption and Circulation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author argues that the primary function of lymphatic vessels is not absorption,
  but rather to maintain a difference in density between the blood and lymph. This
  difference is essential for the proper functioning of the circulatory system and
  the nutrition of internal organs. The author also discusses the connection between
  the lymphatic system and serous membranes, as well as the impact of endosmosis on
  capillary circulation.
