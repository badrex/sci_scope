revised_title: Revisiting Negative After-Images and Successive Contrast with Pure
  Spectral Colours
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Perception
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of negative after-images and successive
  contrast on color perception using pure spectral colors. They refute previous criticisms
  and demonstrate that their results are consistent even when stray light is rigorously
  excluded, suggesting that color perception is influenced by after-images and contrast
  effects.
