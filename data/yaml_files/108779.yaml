revised_title: Investigations into Diatomic Bases and Diphosphonium-Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author explores the formation of diatomic bases and diphosphonium compounds
  through the reaction of ammonia and its homologues with dibromide of ethylene. The
  study focuses on the phosphorus series, where triethylphosphine exhibits distinct
  characteristics and provides a clearer understanding of the relations between monatomic
  and diatomic bases.
