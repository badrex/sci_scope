tldr: The author, Rev. James Farquharson, presents a report on the geometrical measurement
  of the height of the Aurora Borealis. He discusses the observations made, their
  critical discussion, and the correction of misapprehensions regarding his previous
  views. The result of the measurement of one particular aurora gave a height of 5693
  feet for the upper edge and a vertical extension of 3212 feet for the fringe of
  streamers.
