  from 1898 to 1904'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: This study analyzes the atmospheric electric potential at Kew from selected
  days between 1898 and 1904. The research reveals regular diurnal changes, with two
  distinct daily maxima and minima. The 12-hour term is the most important, and the
  annual term is more significant in the annual variation of the diurnal range. The
  study also explores the influence of various meteorological elements on the potential
  gradient.
topics:
- Atmospheric electricity
- Diurnal variations
- Kelvin wate
- Meteorological elements
- Potential gradient
