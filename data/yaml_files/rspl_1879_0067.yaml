revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Sodium and Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, investigate the spectra of sodium and
  potassium using spectroscopic techniques. They identify and describe multiple lines
  in both spectra, providing wavelength measurements and discussing the characteristics
  of each group of lines. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of the
  properties and behavior of these elements in the context of spectroscopy.
