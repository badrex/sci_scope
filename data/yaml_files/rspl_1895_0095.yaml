revised_title: Investigations on the Electrical Changes in Nerve and Their Relation
  to Physico-Chemical Changes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between electrical changes in nerve and
  physico-chemical changes, investigating the effects of various substances and conditions
  on nerve function. The study focuses on the use of isolated frog nerve and the impact
  of anaesthetics, acids, alkalis, salts, and gases on the nerve's electrical activity.
topics:
- Neurophysiology
- Electrical signals in nerve
- Chemical effects on nerve
- Anaesthetics and nerve function
