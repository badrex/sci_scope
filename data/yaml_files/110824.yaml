revised_title: Anatomy and Function of Crustacean Hearing Organs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author, Arthur Farre, examines the structure and function of the hearing
  organs in crustaceans, specifically in the lobster (Astacus marinus). He identifies
  a transparent vestibular sac as the organ of hearing, which contains a delicate
  plexus of nerves and siliccous particles that may act as otolites, similar to those
  in birds' stomachs. Farre also describes variations in the hearing organs of other
  crustaceans and suggests the possibility of another organ at the base of the large
  antennae being an organ of smell.
