  Recessive Whiteness
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Molecular Biology
tldr: This study investigates the chemistry behind coat-color in animals, focusing
  on the role of tyrosinase and peroxidase enzymes. The research also explores dominant
  and recessive whiteness in animals, suggesting that these traits are due to the
  presence or absence of specific enzymes and chromogens in the skin.
