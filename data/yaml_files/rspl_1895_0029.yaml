scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the gas obtained from uraninite through spectroscopic
  analysis and distillation methods. The study reveals that the gas contains multiple
  compounds, and the behavior of its spectral lines suggests that the gas is a mixture
  of different elements and compounds.
