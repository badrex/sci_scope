scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical reaction between morphia and hydrochloric
  acid, resulting in the formation of a new base called apomorphia. The study examines
  the properties, reactions, and physiological effects of apomorphia, which is found
  to be a non-irritant emetic and powerful antistimulant.
