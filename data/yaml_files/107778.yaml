revised_title: Investigating the Reduction of Pendulum Vibrations to a Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author describes the construction and setup of an apparatus to test the
  reduction of pendulum vibrations to a vacuum. The experiments reveal that the proposed
  theory for reducing pendulum vibrations in air to corresponding vibrations in a
  vacuum is incorrect, as it does not account for the expenditure of energy on the
  surrounding air particles.
