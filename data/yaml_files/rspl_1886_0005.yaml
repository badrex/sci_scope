scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of sunlight on micro-organisms and find
  that it inhibits their growth through an oxidative process. They demonstrate that
  the most active rays are those of the more refrangible end of the spectrum and discuss
  the importance of nutrient fluids in their experiments.

- Sunlight and Micro-organisms
- Oxidation
- Inhibition of Bacterial Growth
- Nutrient Media
