scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author presents two unique thermometer designs for measuring extreme temperatures,
  one for recording the highest heat and the other for recording the lowest. These
  thermometers use spirit of wine and mercury to accurately track temperature changes
  and provide valuable information for scientific research and observations.
