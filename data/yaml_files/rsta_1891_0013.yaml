revised_title: Improvements and Investigations on Quadrant Electrometers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of a quadrant electrometer, identifying
  factors that affect its sensitivity and proposing improvements to its design and
  construction. They demonstrate that adjustments to the distance between the quadrants
  and alterations in the construction of the instrument can significantly enhance
  its sensitivity.
