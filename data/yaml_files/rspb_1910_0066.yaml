revised_title: On the Determination of Collateral Correlations in Mendelian Populations
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Heredity
tldr: The author investigates the correlations between collaterals in a simple Mendelian
  population mating at random, finding that the ancestral correlations diminish in
  a geometrical progression. The study also reveals that the resemblance between parent
  and offspring and between siblings is nearly equal, with slight differences.
