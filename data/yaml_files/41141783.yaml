revised_title: Investigating Diurnal Changes in Dipping and Horizontal Needles at
  Port Bowen
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author compares the diurnal changes in intensity of dipping and horizontal
  needles at Port Bowen and concludes that the variations in the horizontal needle's
  intensity are more likely due to changes in the amount of dip rather than variations
  in the general intensity of the Earth's magnetic force.
