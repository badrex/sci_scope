tldr: This paper by Professor A. R. Forsyth investigates the differential invariants
  of a surface and their geometric significance. It explores the use of Zorawski's
  method to simplify the solution of partial differential equations and transform
  them into the partial differential equations of the system of concomitants of a
  set of simultaneous binary forms. The paper also discusses the geometric significance
  of these invariants and their relations to curves on a surface.
