revised_title: Investigation of the Deposit Formation on Pointed Conductors during
  Electricity Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion
tldr: The authors study the formation of deposits on pointed conductors during electricity
  discharge, discovering that moisture in the air plays a significant role in the
  process. They also find that metals like aluminum, magnesium, and zinc form hydrogen
  peroxide when made the anode in an electric circuit, contributing to the deposit
  formation.
