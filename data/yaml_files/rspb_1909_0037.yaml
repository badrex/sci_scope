scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors present a new method for estimating the total volume of blood in
  living organisms by determining the percentage of plasma in the blood and injecting
  a known quantity of dissolved hemoglobin into the bloodstream. This method is simple,
  accurate, and does not cause any noticeable changes in the subject's general condition.
