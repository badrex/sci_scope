revised_title: Researches on the Physico-Chemical Theory of Fermentation and Archebiosis
  in Boiled Fluids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of chemical agents, temperature, and oxygen
  on fermentation in boiled fluids, specifically focusing on urine. The study demonstrates
  that neutral or slightly alkaline organic fluids are more prone to fermentation
  than slightly acidic fluids, and that heat and oxygen can significantly influence
  the process.
