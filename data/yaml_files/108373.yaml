revised_title: Observations on Elliptic Polarization of Light by Reflexion in Various
  Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of elliptic polarization of light by
  reflexion in various substances, including tarnished metals, iridescent films, and
  metallic deposits. The study examines the changes in the form of polarized rings
  under different conditions of surface and incidence, providing insights into the
  nature of elliptic polarization and its applications.
