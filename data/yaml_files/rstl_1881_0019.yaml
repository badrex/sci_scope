  System and Echinus'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The authors examine the locomotor system of echinodermata, specifically the
  ambulacral system in Holothuria and the structures in Echinus. They describe the
  polian vesicle, circular canal, tentacle sinuses, radial canals, and pedicels, as
  well as the role of the perivisceral fluid and the cloacal valve in the locomotion
  of these creatures.
