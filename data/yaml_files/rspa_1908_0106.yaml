revised_title: The Effect of Water Vapour on the Motion of Ions in Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effect of water vapor on the motion of ions in gases,
  discovering that water vapor influences the motion of negative ions but not positive
  ions. The findings suggest that the kinetic energy of translation of ions is equal
  to the energy of translation of an equal number of molecules.
