tldr: The author presents observations of the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle
  at Fort Marlborough, Sumatra, and discusses the effects of heat and the position
  of magnetic poles on the variation. The findings support the theory that heat weakens
  the magnetic virtue and that the magnetic poles are fixed within the Earth's surface.
