tldr: The author investigates the role of antelope and reptiles in the transmission
  of Trypanosoma gambiense, a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness.
  The study finds that antelope, particularly bushbuck and waterbuck, may act as reservoir
  hosts for the disease, increasing the infectivity of wild flies.
