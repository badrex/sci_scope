revised_title: 'Investigating the Solar and Terrestrial Rays that Cause Heat: A Comparative
  Study of Light and Heat Rays'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: This paper investigates the properties of solar and terrestrial rays that cause
  heat and compares them to the properties of light rays. The author discovers that
  heat-making rays have a greater refrangibility than light rays and that they do
  not follow the same pattern of dispersion. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the differences between heat and light rays and their respective properties.
topics:
- Heat and Light Rays
- Spectrum of Heat
