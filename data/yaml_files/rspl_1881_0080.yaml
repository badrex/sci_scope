tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments to investigate earthquake motion
  by creating disturbances using a heavy block of iron falling from a height. They
  observe two distinct sets of vibrations, the direct and transverse waves, and determine
  their velocities of propagation. The low velocities are attributed to the soft nature
  of the material through which the disturbance is propagated.
