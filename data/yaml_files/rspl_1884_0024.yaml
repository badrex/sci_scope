revised_title: A Study of Orthoptic and Isoptic Loci in Geometry
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The article investigates the properties of orthoptic and isoptic loci in geometry,
  focusing on the relationship between tangents and curves. The author demonstrates
  how these loci can be used to understand the behavior of conic sections and their
  associated geometric properties.
