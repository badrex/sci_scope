revised_title: Extension of Poinsot's Representation of the Motion of a Free Rigid
  Body
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a free rigid body using the concept of
  a material ellipsoid and its relation to the momental ellipsoid. The study explores
  the pressure and friction between the ellipsoid and a rough plane, as well as the
  angular momentum of the ellipsoid and a particle at the point of contact.
