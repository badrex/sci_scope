revised_title: On the Distribution of Frequency, Variation, and Correlation of Barometric
  Height at Divers Stations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors analyze barometric height frequency data from 23 stations in the
  British Isles and find that the distribution of frequency does not follow the normal
  curve. They introduce a method to represent the frequency distribution using generalised
  probability curves and discuss the implications for understanding atmospheric pressure.
