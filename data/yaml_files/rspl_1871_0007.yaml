scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents corrections and additions to the memoir on the theory of
  reciprocal surfaces, discussing nodal curves, cuspidal curves, and off-points, as
  well as providing a general table of corrections for computed numbers. The study
  aims to improve the understanding of the mathematical principles governing these
  surfaces.
