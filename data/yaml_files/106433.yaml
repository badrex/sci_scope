scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the precession of equinoxes and its relation to the
  Sun's attraction on the Earth. He explains that the precession is caused by the
  unequal actions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's equatorial regions and discusses
  the effects of these forces on the Earth's figure and rotation.
