scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: This study investigates the coloration of fish skins, particularly in Pleuronectidae
  species, examining the structure and relations of the tissue elements responsible
  for coloration. The authors identify chromatophores and iridocytes as key elements
  and describe the argenteum, a subcutaneous layer responsible for the silvery brilliance
  in some fish species.
