revised_title: The Non-Coincidence of the Focus of Photogenic Rays with That of Visual
  Rays in Achromatic Object-Glasses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: M. A. Claudet investigates the focus adjustment in the Daguerreotype process
  and discovers that the focus of photogenic rays is not coincident with the visual
  focus in achromatic object-glasses. By adjusting the focus according to the nature
  of the lens and the intensity of light, the author achieves perfect delineations
  of objects.
