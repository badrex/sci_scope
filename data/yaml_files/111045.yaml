revised_title: A New Approach to the Mathematical Theory of Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author presents a new mathematical theory of magnetism, free from the assumption
  of two magnetic fluids. This theory is based on known facts and Coulomb's experimental
  researches, and aligns with Poisson's mathematical theory. The author plans to extend
  this work to include magnetic induction in ferromagnetic and diamagnetic substances.
