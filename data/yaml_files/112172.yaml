revised_title: 'On Calorescence: A Study of Invisible Radiation and its Effects'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This paper by John Tyndall explores the phenomenon of calorescence, where invisible
  radiant heat is converted into light. The study includes experiments on the distribution
  of heat in the spectrum of electric light, filtering composite radiation, and the
  effects of invisible rays on combustion. Tyndall also investigates the properties
  of various substances as ray filters and the effects of invisible radiation on different
  materials.
