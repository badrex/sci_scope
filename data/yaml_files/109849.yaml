revised_title: Efficient Methods for Calculating Planetary Excentricity from Mean
  Anomaly
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Motion
tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, presents three direct and efficient methods for
  calculating the excentricity of a planet from its mean anomaly. These methods use
  Cassini's approximation and Keill's series, and one method combines both, making
  it simpler and more practical than previous proposals.
