  Ooze
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Geology
tldr: During the 'Challenger' cruise in the Southern Sea, Professor C. Wyville Thomson
  discovered five distinct types of sea-bottom. He found that the Globigerina ooze,
  a calcareous formation, is composed of dead organisms that live at the surface and
  intermediate depths. This formation is of great interest due to its anomalous character
  and vast extension across the ocean.
