revised_title: Observations on the Latitude and Obliquity of the Ecliptic at Nurenburg
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author compares historical observations made by Bernard Walther in 1487
  with recent observations by P. Wurtzelbaur to determine if the Earth's poles and
  axis have shifted. The study finds that the latitude and obliquity of the ecliptic
  at Nurenburg have remained constant, suggesting that any changes to the Earth's
  poles would require a long time to become noticeable.
