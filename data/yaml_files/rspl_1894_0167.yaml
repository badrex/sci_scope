scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of various environmental factors, such as
  temperature, light spectrum, and water salinity, on the development of echinoderm
  larvae. The results show that these factors significantly impact the growth and
  size of the larvae, with some factors causing a decrease in size while others have
  a positive influence.
