revised_title: Investigating the Meridian Line and its Impact on the Declination of
  the Magnetic Needle and the Pole's Elevation

scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: Dr. Wallis receives a letter suggesting that the Meridian Line may have undergone
  a variation, which could affect the declination of the magnetic needle and the pole's
  elevation. He proposes that this variation may be due to the Earth's axis wobbling,
  causing the noon-shade of a perpendicular to not always lie in the same line. This
  suggestion, if well-grounded, could have significant consequences for understanding
  the Earth's rotation and the behavior of the magnetic needle.
