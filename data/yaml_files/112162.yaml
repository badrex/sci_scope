scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: This study examines the unique structure of the chameleon's retina, including
  the fovea and pecten, and compares it to other amphibians and reptiles. The research
  highlights the arrangement of cones and the oblique nervous fibers that connect
  them to the optic nerve fibers, as well as the distribution of connective tissue
  fibers in the retina.
