revised_title: Electromotive Properties of Dionaea Excited and Unexcited States
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the Dionaea leaf in
  both excited and unexcited states. The study reveals a link between the resting
  current and the action current of the leaf, suggesting an essential relationship
  between the two phenomena. The findings support the idea that the excitable structures
  of plants and animals share a common principle, with the property of excitability
  expressed by relative positivity and the condition of discharge by relative negativity.
