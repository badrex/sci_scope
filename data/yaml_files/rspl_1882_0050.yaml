revised_title: Investigation into the Coagulation of the Perivisceral Fluid of the
  Sea-Urchin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the coagulation process of the perivisceral fluid in
  sea-urchins and discovers that the coagulum is not solely due to the massing of
  amoeboid corpuscles, but also involves the exudation of a coagulable material. This
  material is distinct from fibrin found in vertebrate blood and is more closely related
  to mucin.
