revised_title: On the Measurement and Influence of Magnetic Properties of Iron
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Magnetism
tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments on the magnetic properties of
  iron, focusing on the energy required to produce different magnetic inductions,
  the effect of air gaps, and the influence of increased frequency of cyclic variation
  on energy dissipation. The study also compares the use of an autographic recorder,
  wattmeter, and Joubert's instantaneous contact method for measuring energy dissipation.
topics:
- Magnetic Properties of Iron
- Magnetic Induction
- Hysteresis
- Energy Dissipation
- Frequency of Cyclic Variation
