revised_title: 'Atmospheric Electricity Over the Ocean: Observations and Explanations'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: This article discusses the observations and potential explanations of atmospheric
  electricity over the ocean. The authors analyze the potential-gradient fluctuations,
  the effect of rain, and the emanation content in different latitudes. They propose
  that the air descending from higher latitudes takes up emanation from the sea-water,
  while the air in the equatorial region is washed by frequent heavy showers, causing
  a decrease in emanation.
