revised_title: The Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the absorption and radiation of heat by various gases
  and vapors using a thermo-electric pile and a series of experiments. The results
  show that gases like olefiant gas and sulfuric ether have high absorptive energy,
  while oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and atmospheric air have a weaker effect. The
  author also explores the connection between absorption, radiation, and conduction,
  and suggests that these phenomena can be explained by simple mechanical principles.
