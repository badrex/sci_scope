revised_title: On the Drift of Ions by Electromagnetic Disturbances and Radioactivity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the drift of ions in the presence of electromagnetic
  disturbances and proposes a theory of radioactivity. The study reveals that ions
  appear to move in space with velocities that are influenced by the direction of
  the waves, suggesting a connection between radioactivity and the propagation of
  electromagnetic disturbances.
