revised_title: The Specific Heats of Metals and the Relation of Specific Heat to Atomic
  Weight - Part III
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the specific heats of metals and their relation to atomic
  weight. Experiments were conducted on tellurium compounds and alloys, revealing
  a close concordance between the sum of atomic heats and the molecular heat of the
  compounds at various temperatures. The results support the view that specific heat
  is determined by the nature of the atoms composing the molecules and is not a measure
  of the thermal work done.
