tldr: The author, George J. Burch, presents a perspective microscope that provides
  constant magnification along the optic axis, allowing for objects to be viewed in
  microscopic perspective. The microscope's formula is derived, and it is demonstrated
  that it offers constant longitudinal magnification and lateral magnification. The
  perspective belonging to an object magnified is also discussed.
