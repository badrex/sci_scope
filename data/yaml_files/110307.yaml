revised_title: 'Experimental Researches in Electricity: Induction and Electro-Tonic
  State'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors, Samuel Hunter Christie and John Bostock, investigate the induction
  of electricity in motion and discover the electro-tonic state, a unique condition
  in which a wire's state is only manifest upon interrupting or renewing the inducing
  circuit. They also demonstrate the connection between electricity and magnetism,
  providing evidence of electricity being produced by ordinary magnetism.
