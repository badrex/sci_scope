revised_title: On the Melting Point and Identification of Organic Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author develops a method to accurately determine the melting points of organic
  substances using a simple apparatus. The melting points serve as important physical
  constants and can be used as thermometric standards, enabling the calibration of
  mercurial instruments without corrections.
