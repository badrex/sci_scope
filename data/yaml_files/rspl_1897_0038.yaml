revised_title: Experimental Study of Heat Transfer between Metal Surfaces and Liquids
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal & Fluids Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the rate of heat transfer between metal surfaces and
  liquids, focusing on the factors affecting the process, such as the convection of
  heated water particles and the varying temperatures of the metal surfaces. They
  propose a method to study this phenomenon using a metal pipe surrounded by a water
  jacket, and present experimental results that support their findings.
