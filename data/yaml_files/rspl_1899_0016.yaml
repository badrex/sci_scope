revised_title: The Life Cycle and Infection Mechanism of Onygena equina, a Horn-Destroying
  Fungus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Myecology & Fungal Biology
tldr: The author investigates the life cycle and infection mechanism of Onygena equina,
  a fungus that grows on feathers, hair, horn, and hoofs. They discover the development
  of sporo phores, the germination and growth of chlamydospores, and the infection
  process of horn. The research has implications for understanding the decomposition
  of hair, horn, feathers, and hoofs used in agriculture.
