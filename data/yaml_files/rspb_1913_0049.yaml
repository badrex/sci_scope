revised_title: The Role of Surface Tension in the Distribution of Salts in Living
  Matter
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the role of surface tension in the distribution of salts
  in living matter, specifically in Acineta tuberosa. They find that surface tension
  influences the localisation of salts and other solutes in cells and tissues, and
  plays a significant role in controlling the diffusion through living membranes that
  leads to the formation of excretions and secretions.
