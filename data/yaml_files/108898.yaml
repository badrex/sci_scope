revised_title: 'On the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve: A Study of the Hessian and
  Conic of Five-pointic Contact'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the sextactic points of a plane curve using the Hessian
  and the conic of five-pointic contact. They develop a transformation to eliminate
  extraneous factors and derive equations to determine the coordinates of the sextactic
  points of the curve.
