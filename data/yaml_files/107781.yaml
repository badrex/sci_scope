scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the anatomical structure of a Chinese female foot, specifically
  a specimen from a lower-class individual, and describes the significant alterations
  caused by the practice of foot binding. The foot's skeletal structure, sole, and
  dorsum are analyzed, revealing the impact of long-term pressure on bones and the
  challenges faced in movement and posture due to these deformities.
