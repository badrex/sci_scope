revised_title: On the Electrocapillary Phenomena and Their Relation to Potential Differences
  between Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the nature of electrocapillary phenomena and their relation
  to potential differences between solutions, examining the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory
  and its discrepancies with the Nernst-Planck theory. The study focuses on solutions
  of potassium chloride and potassium iodide, providing insights into the electrocapillary
  curves and the surface tension of the solutions.
