revised_title: The Decomposition of Amygdalin by Yeast
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the decomposition of amygdalin, a cyanogenetic glucoside,
  by yeast and find that it is broken down into mandelonitrile glucoside, dextrose,
  and hydrocyanic acid. They also discover that the hydrolysis of amygdalin is not
  due to invertase, a yeast enzyme, but rather to another unidentified enzyme in yeast.
