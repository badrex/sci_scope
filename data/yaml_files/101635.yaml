tldr: Monsieur Picart's method of measuring the Earth's circumference involved measuring
  a 5663-toise base and using a scale of triangles to determine the length of a meridian
  line. His findings suggest a length of 57060 toises or fathoms for one degree, which,
  when multiplied by 360 degrees, results in a total circumference of 10270 leagues
  and 1600 toises.
