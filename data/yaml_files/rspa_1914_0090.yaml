revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Dust on Atmospheric Potential Gradient
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author examines the impact of various sources of dust on the atmospheric
  potential gradient, discovering that dust raised by wind, traffic, and manufacturing
  operations can significantly alter the gradient. The study also reveals that the
  sign and magnitude of the charge on the dust depend on its chemical composition
  and fineness.
