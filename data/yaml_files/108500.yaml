scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Geometry
tldr: The author introduces the concept of quantics, which are rational and integral
  functions, and their associated equations and loci. They also discuss covariants,
  functions that are reduced to zero by each operation of the entire system, and their
  role in understanding the properties of quantics.
