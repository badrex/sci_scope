revised_title: The Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism and Its External and
  Internal Sources
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and finds
  that the leading features can be represented by the surface harmonic of the second
  degree and first type. The results of the calculations point to an external source
  and an additional internal source, providing evidence for the Earth's average conductivity.
