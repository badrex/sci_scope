revised_title: Electrolysis-Induced Vibrations and Musical Sounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry
tldr: The author, George Gore, discovers that when a large quantity of electricity
  is passed through a suitable electrolyte into a small surface of mercury, strong
  vibrations and musical sounds occur. This phenomenon is dependent on the power of
  the battery and the strength of the electrolyte solution.
