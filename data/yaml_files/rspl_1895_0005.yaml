tldr: The author investigates the microstructure of iron and discovers a secondary
  crystalline formation within the primary crystals. This duplex crystallization occurs
  in large masses of wrought iron when slowly cooled from a white heat, and the author
  suggests that this phenomenon may be due to the slow cooling process allowing the
  formation of smaller crystals within the primary ones.
