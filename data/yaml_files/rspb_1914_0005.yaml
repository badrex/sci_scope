scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the fossil plant Medullosa pusilla, a small and rare species
  found in the Lower Coal Measures. The study focuses on the plant's structure, including
  its vascular system, cortex, and leaf-bases, and compares it to the more well-known
  species Medullosa anglica. The author concludes that while the two species share
  similarities, Medullosa pusilla is smaller and has a simpler hypoderma.
