revised_title: Investigating the Structure and Properties of Metal Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the structure and mechanical properties of gold alloys
  containing 0.2% of various impurities. They find that the mechanical properties
  of these alloys are not related to their structure, appearance of fractures, or
  melting points of the alloying elements. The authors conclude that the impurities
  do not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the alloys, as they are
  not present in most of the samples examined.
