revised_title: The Effect of Light on Protoplasm and Bacterial Development
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of different wavelengths of light on the
  development of bacteria and fungi in various solutions. They find that blue and
  violet light have the most significant inhibitory effects on bacterial growth, while
  red light appears to be less effective. The study also demonstrates that the cultivation
  fluid itself does not play a significant role in the observed phenomena.
