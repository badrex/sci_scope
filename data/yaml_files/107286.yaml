scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Psychiatry
tldr: The author examines the condition of cretinism, a form of mental and physical
  disability prevalent in certain regions, and its connection to goitre. Through observation
  and comparison of cases, the author concludes that environmental factors, such as
  poor air quality, humidity, and inadequate nutrition, play a significant role in
  the development of cretinism, rather than the previously believed cause of snow-water
  consumption.
