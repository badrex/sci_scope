  in Greenland
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author analyzes tidal observations made in Frederiksdal, Greenland, from
  1863 to 1864, and discusses the semidiurnal tides, their maximum and minimum ranges,
  and the parallactic inequality. The study provides insights into the eccentricity
  of the Moon's orbit, the mass of the Moon, and the depth of the ocean canal traversed
  by the tide.
