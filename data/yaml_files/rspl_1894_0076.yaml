revised_title: On Tesseral Harmonics and Their Applications
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate certain functions connected with tesseral harmonics,
  focusing on the transformation of a zonal harmonic from one pole to another on a
  sphere. They explore the properties of these functions and their applications in
  various physical scenarios, including the mutual potential energy of two layers
  of gravitating matter on two spheres.
topics:
- Tesseral Harmonics
- Angular Distance Functions
- Dynamical Similarity
- Geometric Transformations
- Spherical Harmonics
