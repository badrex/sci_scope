revised_title: The Rotation and Luminosity Phenomenon of the Electric Arc
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the rotation and luminosity phenomenon of the electric
  arc, discovering that a bright spot near the middle of the arc crater periodically
  rotates. They also find that the effective luminosity is not constant or uniform,
  posing a challenge to using the arc as a standard of light.
