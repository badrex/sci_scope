revised_title: On the Existence and Properties of Super-Acid and Sub-Acid Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the existence and properties
  of super-acid and sub-acid salts, providing experimental evidence for the law of
  simple multiples in chemical reactions. He demonstrates this through various experiments
  involving the combination of alkalis and acids, and discusses the potential role
  of geometrical arrangement of elementary particles in these reactions.
