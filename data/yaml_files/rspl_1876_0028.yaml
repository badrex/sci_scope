revised_title: 'The Law of Fatigue: Experiments in Lifting Weights at Varying Rates
  of Motion'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Exercise & Sports Science
tldr: The author investigates the law of fatigue by conducting experiments in which
  subjects lift weights at varying rates of motion without rest. The results show
  a correlation between the total work done, the rate of work, and the time taken
  to reach fatigue, supporting the application of the law of fatigue in this context.
