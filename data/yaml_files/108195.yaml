revised_title: 'Researches on Tides: Determining Laws from Short Series of Observations'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author investigates the possibility of determining the laws of tides and
  their corrections from short series of observations, specifically one year, rather
  than longer series. This approach can improve the accuracy and practicality of tide
  tables and help answer questions about the changes in tide phenomena over time and
  location.
