revised_title: On the Theory of Resonance in Vibration Systems
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: The authors explore the theory of resonance in a class of resonators, focusing
  on the dynamics of air vibrations in spaces with rigid walls and multiple passages.
  They establish a formula for determining resonant notes and discuss the conductivity
  of different passage forms. The study also considers the resistance of tubes and
  the vibrations of multi-vessel systems.
