revised_title: 'On the Problem of Three Bodies: New Methods of Treating Dynamical
  Equations'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author presents two new methods for treating dynamical equations, tangential
  variation and osculating variation, and applies them to planetary and lunar theories.
  The methods provide more accurate solutions and avoid the limitations of traditional
  direct methods of approximation.
topics:
- Dynamical Equations
- Variation of Elements
- Planetary Theory
- Lunar Theory
- Osculating Variation
