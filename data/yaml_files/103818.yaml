scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the chemical properties of phosphorus and its ability
  to transform into glass through a series of experiments. They discover that phosphorus,
  consisting of acid and oil components from urine, can be deflagrated and subsequently
  transmuted into a fine transparent glass with properties similar to a diamond.
