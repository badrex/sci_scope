scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomical Techniques & Methods
tldr: The author, Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth, describes an equatorial instrument designed
  to measure the right ascension and declination of the apex of the Zodiacal Light.
  He found the phenomenon to be more stable and determinate than previously represented,
  with a probable error of not more than 2Â°. Smyth encourages other observers in favorable
  positions to continue the study and shares a series of views of the Zodiacal Light's
  appearances at different times of the year.
