revised_title: Experimental Researches on Magnecrystals and Temperature Effects
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Materials Science
tldr: Faraday investigates the behavior of magnecrystals in various media and the
  effects of temperature on their setting force. He also observes the changes in magnetic
  force in iron, nickel, and cobalt as temperature increases.
