scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Vehicle Design
tldr: Sir R. B. describes a new type of carriage, the Calesh, which has two wheels
  and improved stability. It is easier to maneuver than a common coach and can handle
  uneven terrain. The inventor, who has improved the design since his time in London,
  demonstrates the Calesh's capabilities by running experiments on various terrains
  and even overturning it multiple times without causing harm to the rider or the
  horse.
