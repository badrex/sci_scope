revised_title: Investigating the Figure of the Earth and Fluid Attraction
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical calculation to determine the figure of the
  Earth, considering it as a fluid with varying density. The study investigates the
  attraction of a body with varying density and applies the method to a broader range
  of spheroids, improving upon Laplace's solution.
