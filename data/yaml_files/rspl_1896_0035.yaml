revised_title: Magnetization of Liquids and Temperature Effects
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetization of liquids using a sensitive induction
  balance and discovers that the coefficient of magnetization for ferric and ferrous
  salts in solution depends only on the quantity of iron per cubic centimeter present.
  The experiments also show that the effect of temperature on the coefficient of magnetization
  follows a similar trend for all the salts tested.
