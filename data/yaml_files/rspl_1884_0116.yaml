tldr: The author presents a memoir that explores the treatment of mathematical thought
  as a connected whole, separating its essential elements from the various forms of
  representation, such as algebraical, geometrical, and logical. The memoir introduces
  fundamental principles and demonstrates their truth through various applications.
topics:
- Mathematical Form
- Fundamental Principles
- Algebraical Expressions
- Geometric Representation
- Logical Analysis
