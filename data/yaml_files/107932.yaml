tldr: The author analyzes meteorological observations made at the Royal Society between
  1827 and 1829, focusing on the annual and diurnal variations of the barometer and
  thermometer. The study reveals that the mean height of the barometer at 9 AM is
  greater than at 3 PM, and that the fluctuations of the barometer due to the moon
  are not as significant as previously thought.
