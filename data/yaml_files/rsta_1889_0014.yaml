revised_title: Magnetic and Other Physical Properties of Iron at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic and physical properties of iron at high
  temperatures, discovering that the critical temperature for various iron samples
  ranges from 69°C to 787°C. The permeability of iron increases rapidly near the critical
  temperature, and the temperature coefficient of electrical resistance is greater
  for iron than for other metals.
