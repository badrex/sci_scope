scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Anatomy
tldr: This case study examines a man with extensive intestinal adhesions, which made
  it impossible to separate the intestines without causing damage. The patient's autopsy
  revealed unusual findings, including thickened peritoneum, obstructed exhaling vessels,
  and enlarged lymphatic glands. The cause of death remains uncertain, but the case
  provides valuable insights into the study of pathology and anatomy.
