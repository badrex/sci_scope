tldr: George Robinson's study challenges Dr. Robert Lee's assertions about foetal
  digestion. He demonstrates that human foetuses, like those of other higher animals,
  have albuminous or nutritious matter that undergoes digestion in the small intestines
  during later intra-uterine life. The nature of this substance varies among different
  animals, and Robinson suggests that the salivary glands may be the source of this
  matter.
