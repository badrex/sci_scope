revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Steam Passage Rate on the Boiling Point
  of Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of steam passage rate on the boiling point
  of water using differential platinum thermometers. They find that the boiling point
  is affected not only by the height of water but also by the rate at which steam
  passes through it. The results are plotted on a hyperbola, showing a relationship
  between the height of liquid and the rate of steam passage.
