scientific_subdiscipline: Nutrition & Metabolism
tldr: This study investigates the histological changes in the teeth of guinea-pigs
  fed a scorbutic diet. The researchers found that even mild scurvy caused significant
  changes in the structure of the teeth, with fibrosis and obliteration of cellular
  elements. The findings highlight the importance of proper nutrition for dental health
  and the value of animal models in studying human diseases.
