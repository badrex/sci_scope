revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Origins of Nova Persei's Spectral Lines
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author compares the spectrum of Nova Persei with other celestial objects,
  such as a Cygni and Nova Aurigae, to determine the chemical origins of its spectral
  lines. The study suggests that the temperatures reached during the outbursts of
  both Novae were not significantly different from those of the mentioned stars, and
  that the conditions in these stars are similar to the temporary conditions that
  produce the appearance of Novae.
