scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: In a series of experiments, Hauksbee investigates the time it takes for various
  objects to fall in air, using a pendulum to measure the time. He drops different
  weights and sizes of balls from a height of 220 feet and observes the effect of
  air resistance on their descent.
