revised_title: Determination of the Electrochemical Equivalent of Silver and Electromotive
  Force of Clark Cells
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the electrochemical equivalent of silver and the electromotive
  force of Clark cells, providing a method for determining these values without relying
  on measurements of length, angle, or moments of inertia.
topics:
- Electrochemistry
- Electromotive force
- Electrochemical equivalent
- Clark cells
- Electrical resistance
