tldr: The author, William Rowan Hamilton, presents a general method in dynamics that
  reduces the study of free systems of attracting or repelling points to the search
  and differentiation of a central relation or characteristic function. The paper
  covers various aspects of this method, including integration, verification, relative
  coordinates, separation of motion, binary systems, and multiple systems.
topics:
- Dynamics
- Characteristic Function
- Relative Motion
- Binary Systems
- Multiple Systems
