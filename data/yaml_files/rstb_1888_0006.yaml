tldr: The author examines the post-embryonic development of the myriapod Julus terrestris,
  focusing on the formation of its organs and the role of mesoblastic segments in
  its growth. The study reveals similarities in the development of somites in Julus
  terrestris and Peripatus, as well as the formation of the coelom and the generative
  organ.
