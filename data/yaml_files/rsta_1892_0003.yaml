revised_title: On the Expansion of Liquid Water and the Vapour-Pressures of Steam
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the expansion of liquid water and the vapor pressures
  of steam using a glass tube apparatus. They provide detailed measurements and analysis
  of the properties of water and steam at various temperatures, contributing to the
  understanding of water's behavior under different conditions.
