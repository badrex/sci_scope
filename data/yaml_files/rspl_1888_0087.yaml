revised_title: A Method for Detecting Dissolved Chemical Compounds and Their Combining
  Proportions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author presents a method using the 'voltaic balance' to detect and measure
  the combining proportions of dissolved chemical compounds in electrolytes. The method
  is based on the principle that when substances chemically combine, they lose some
  of their power to excite a voltaic couple. The author demonstrates the effectiveness
  of this method on various mixtures of elements, acids, and salts, and suggests that
  it can be used to determine the degrees of valency, basicity, and purity of substances.
