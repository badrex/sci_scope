revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Neon, Krypton, and Xenon
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of neon, krypton, and xenon using vacuum
  tubes and a Rowland concave grating. They discover that each gas has a unique and
  characteristic spectrum, with krypton and xenon having two spectra each. The study
  also reveals about forty lines of weak intensity common to the jar and spark gap
  spectra of krypton and xenon, which may indicate the presence of another element
  of higher atomic weight.
