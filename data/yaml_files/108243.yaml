revised_title: Observations on the Contraction of Voluntary Muscle in Tetanus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Muscle Physiology
tldr: The author examines the contraction of voluntary muscle in tetanus cases and
  concludes that the contraction is partial and engages only parts of each muscle
  fiber at a time, changing their place to bring every portion into use. This study
  provides insights into the nature of tetanic spasm and its relationship to normal
  muscle contractions.
