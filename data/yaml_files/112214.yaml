revised_title: Observations on Larynx Movements and Vocal Production Using the Laryngoscope
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the movements of the larynx and vocal production using
  the laryngoscope, discovering the role of the vocal cords, arytenoid cartilages,
  and epiglottis in producing different tones and sounds. The study confirms the vocal
  cords function as a valve and a reed, and the laryngoscope provides valuable insights
  into the complex mechanisms of voice production.
