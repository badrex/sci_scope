revised_title: Investigation of the Decrease in Velocity of α-Particles in Passing
  Through Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: Marsden, Taylor, and Rutherford investigate the decrease in velocity of α-particles
  as they pass through various materials, such as gold, copper, and mica. They use
  a radium source and scintillation detection to measure the velocity changes and
  discuss the implications for understanding atomic structure and particle acceleration.
topics:
- Atomic Structure
- Particle Acceleration
- Magnetic Fields
- Scintillation Detection
- Radium Decay
