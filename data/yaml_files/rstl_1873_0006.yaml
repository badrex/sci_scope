revised_title: Spectrum Analysis and the Sun's Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure and temperature on spectral
  lines using sodium vapor and demonstrates the importance of these findings in solar
  and stellar physics. The new method of observing spectra allows for the examination
  of minute portions of the sun and its surrounding atmosphere, revealing the thickening
  of Fraunhofer lines in solar spots and the thinning in the chromosphere and prominences.
