revised_title: The Effect of Elastic Distortion on the Rotation of a Spheroid
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: This article investigates the impact of elastic distortion on the rotation of
  a spheroid, specifically the Earth, and finds that the period of oscillation is
  prolonged due to the Earth's solid parts undergoing elastic deformation.
topics:
- Elasticity Theory
- Spheroid Mechanics
- Geophysics
- Celestial Mechanics
- Earth's Rotation
