revised_title: Preventing Copper Corrosion in Ships Using Electrical Power
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion Science
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy discovers that a green rust forms on copper sheeting exposed
  to sea-water, leading to corrosion. He finds that this corrosion can be prevented
  by using weak negative electricity, easily excited by the contact of a tin surface.
  This method also prevents the adhesion of marine animals and plants.
