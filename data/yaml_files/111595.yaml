revised_title: Specific Gravity of Alloys and Their Expansion on Cooling
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the specific gravity of various alloys and their expansion
  on cooling. The study includes alloys of antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, silver,
  lead, mercury, and gold. The results show that some alloys expand significantly
  on cooling, while others do not. The alloys of bismuth-antimony, bismuth-gold, and
  bismuth-silver exhibit the most significant expansion.
