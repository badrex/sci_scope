revised_title: 'Researches in Physical Astronomy: The Problem of Precession of the
  Equinoxes'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: John William Lubbock investigates the stability of a system of bodies in physical
  astronomy, specifically focusing on the precession of the equinoxes. He demonstrates
  that the equilibrium of the system remains stable, with the pole of the axis of
  rotation maintaining a nearly constant geographical latitude and the angular velocity
  of rotation and obliquity of the ecliptic varying within small limits.
