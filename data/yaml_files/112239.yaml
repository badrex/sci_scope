revised_title: Synthesis and Properties of Tribasic Acids from Terbromide of Allyle
  and Cyanide of Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of tribasic acids from terbromide of allyle
  and cyanide of potassium. They successfully synthesize a new tribasic acid with
  the formula C21H8O2 and analyze its properties, providing evidence for its tribasic
  nature.
