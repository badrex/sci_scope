revised_title: A Critique of the New Opinion on the Forces of Moving Bodies in Non-Elastic
  Collisions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author examines the new opinion on the forces of moving bodies in non-elastic
  collisions and argues that it cannot be true in all cases of non-elastic bodies.
  He provides examples and calculations to demonstrate that equal causes can have
  unequal effects, challenging the new opinion's validity.

- Classical Mechanics
- Collisions
