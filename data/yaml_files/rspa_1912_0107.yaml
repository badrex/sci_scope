revised_title: Investigation of the Dissociation Pressures and Melting Points of the
  Copper-Cuprous Oxide System
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the dissociation pressures and melting points of the
  copper-cuprous oxide system, finding that mixtures with compositions between 20%
  and 95% cuprous oxide separate into two layers above 1195°C. The melting point of
  pure cuprous oxide is approximately 1210°C. The phase rule is used to determine
  the type of pressure-temperature diagram for the system.
