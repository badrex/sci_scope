  Lens Removal
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the eye's ability to adjust itself to different distances
  when deprived of the crystalline lens. Experiments on a patient with cataracts show
  that the eye can still adjust to varying distances, providing evidence against Dr.
  Young's claims that the adjustment of the eye depends solely on the crystalline
  lens.
