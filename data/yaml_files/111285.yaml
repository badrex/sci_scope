revised_title: Temperature Correction for Pendulum Experiments in the Harton Colliery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Measurement
tldr: G. B. Airy investigates the temperature correction for pendulum experiments
  conducted in the Harton Colliery. He uses two rooms at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
  to compare the effects of heat on two pendulums. The results suggest that the earth's
  mean density is 6*809 when a specific correction is applied, but if a particular
  series of observations is excluded, the density is 6'623.
