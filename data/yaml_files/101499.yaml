revised_title: A New Statical Baroscope for Measuring Atmospheric Pressure
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Robert Boyle describes a new type of baroscope, called the statical baroscope,
  which uses a glass bubble and a counterpoise to measure atmospheric pressure. The
  device allows for the detection of small changes in air pressure, providing valuable
  information about the weight of the atmosphere.
