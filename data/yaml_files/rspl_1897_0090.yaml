revised_title: On the Geometrical Treatment of the 'Normal Curve' of Statistics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Probability
tldr: The author simplifies and extends the geometrical treatment of the 'normal curve'
  of statistics, focusing on correlation and error theory. The method allows for a
  better understanding of frequency distributions, correlation-solids, and the distribution
  of errors in various expressions.
topics:
- Statistics
- Correlation
- Error Theory
- Normal Distribution
- Geometric Analysis
