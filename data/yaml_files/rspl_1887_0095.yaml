revised_title: The Effect of Surface Brightness on the Temperature of Incandescent
  Materials
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between surface brightness and temperature
  in incandescent materials, finding that a higher temperature is required for dull
  surfaces to produce the same amount of light as bright surfaces.
topics:
- Thermodynamics
- Heat Radiation
- Surface Properties
- Incandescent Materials
- Temperature Measurement
