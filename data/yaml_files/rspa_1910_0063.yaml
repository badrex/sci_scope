revised_title: Investigation of Precipitant Effects on Salt Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This study investigates the effects of various precipitants on the displacement
  of salts from solution, focusing on the behavior of ammonium, potassium, and sodium
  chlorides. The results confirm previous findings and reveal the influence of precipitants
  like ethylic, methylic, and propylic alcohols on salt solubility and molecular hydration.
