  Electrodes'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: This article investigates the electromotive force generated by the action of
  electrolytes on electrolytes using a quadrant electrometer. The author examines
  various experiments involving different electrolyte combinations and discusses the
  effects of temperature and insulation on the observed electromotive force. The study
  highlights the importance of proper insulation and understanding the potential errors
  in electrical experiments due to electrolytic polarization.
