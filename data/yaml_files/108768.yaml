revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Density and Expansion of Steam
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the density and expansion of steam
  at different temperatures using a unique saturation gauge. They find that the density
  and expansion of steam deviate from the gaseous laws at temperatures above 212Â°F,
  confirming previous theoretical predictions.
