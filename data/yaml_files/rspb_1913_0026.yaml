revised_title: 'The Formation of Anthocyan Pigments in Plants: Chromogen Oxidation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Genetics
tldr: The authors investigate the formation of anthocyan pigments in plants, specifically
  focusing on the role of chromogen oxidation. They demonstrate that the recovery
  of color in decolorized petals is due to the oxidation of chromogens, rather than
  an indicator reaction. This research contributes to the understanding of plant pigmentation
  and the biochemical processes that determine flower color.
