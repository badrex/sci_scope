revised_title: The Effect of Desiccation on Tubercular Sputum Virulence
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology
tldr: The study investigates the virulence of desiccated tubercular sputum by exposing
  rabbits and guinea pigs to two plots treated with the sputum. The results show that
  80% of the animals developed tuberculosis, with the respiratory system being the
  most affected. The experiment suggests that desiccation for 14 days may not be enough
  to eliminate the virulence of the sputum, and further research is needed to determine
  the optimal conditions for this process.
