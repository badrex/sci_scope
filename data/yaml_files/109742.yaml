revised_title: The Role of Ribs in the Progressive Motion of Snakes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: Everard Home's study reveals that the progressive motion of snakes is partly
  performed by means of their ribs. He observes that the motion is common to all the
  ribs of the snake tribe and describes the unique structure and attachment of the
  ribs to the vertebrae. The muscles involved in this motion are also discussed, with
  reference to accompanying drawings.
