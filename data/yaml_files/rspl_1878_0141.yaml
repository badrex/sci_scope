scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Linguistics & Speech Sciences
tldr: The authors, William Henry Preece and Augustus Stroh, present a new method for
  analyzing sonorous vibrations and speech reproduction using a phonautograph. They
  develop a device that records the vibrations of a stretched rubber membrane, which
  is then used to study vowel sounds and their variations in different dialects.
