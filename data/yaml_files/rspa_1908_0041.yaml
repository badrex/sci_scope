revised_title: On the Vapour-Pressure and Osmotic Pressure of Strong Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The author develops a theory of strong solutions based on a simple relation
  between vapour-pressure and concentration, providing a better understanding of the
  phenomena observed in osmotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure experiments.
topics:
- Vapour-Pressure
- Osmotic Pressure
- Strong Solutions
- Equilibrium
- Hydrostatic Pressure
