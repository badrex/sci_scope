revised_title: On the Dependence of the Refractive Index of Gases on Temperature
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the refractive index of gases and its dependence on
  temperature using the interference method. The results show that the refractive
  index of gases varies with temperature, and the accuracy of the measurements is
  estimated to be within 1 in 500.
topics:
- Refractive Index
- Temperature Dependence
- Gas Properties
- Interference Method
