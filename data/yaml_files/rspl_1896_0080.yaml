revised_title: The Impact of Magnetic Fields on Radiation Frequency and Spectral Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: Dr. J. Larmor investigates the influence of a magnetic field on radiation frequency
  and spectral lines, finding that the magnetic field alters the index of refraction
  of circularly polarized light. This research supports the electric theory of light
  and the idea that the electric character of a molecule is determined by the orbits
  of its electrons.
