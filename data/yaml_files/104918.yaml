revised_title: Investigating the Cause of Ascent of Vapour and Exhalation, and the
  Phenomenon of Weather and Barometer
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author examines the causes of the ascent of vapour and exhalation, the role
  of fire in maintaining atmospheric homogeneity, and the factors influencing weather
  and barometer phenomena. He challenges the widely accepted theories of vesicle formation
  and ascent, proposing alternative explanations for these natural processes.
