revised_title: Discovering the Cause of Annual Changes in Declination of Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: James Bradley, Astronomer Royal, investigates an annual change in the declination
  of some fixed stars, which cannot be explained by the precession of the equinoxes.
  He discovers that this change is due to the Earth's movement, leading to the development
  of the concept of aberration of light.
