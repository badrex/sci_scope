scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Geometry
tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of quadratic forms containing more
  than three indeterminates, focusing on the classification of orders and genera based
  on invariants and the properties of their matrices. The study covers the principles
  of transformation, index of inertia, and the identification of primitive concomitants
  and contravariants.
