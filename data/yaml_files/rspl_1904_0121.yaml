revised_title: 'The Halogen Hydrides as Conducting Solvents: Part IV - Preliminary
  Notice'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the halogen hydrides as conducting solvents and find
  that their behavior is inconsistent with the theories of Arrhenius, Hoff, and Ostwald.
  They propose that the dissolved substance combines with the solvent, forming a compound
  that undergoes ionic dissociation, which explains the observed results.
