revised_title: Comparing Experimental and Theoretical Velocities of Sound in Cold
  Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author analyzes Captain Parry's and Lieutenant Foster's experiments on the
  velocity of sound in cold temperatures and compares them to Laplace's theoretical
  formula. The results show a difference between calculation and experiment, suggesting
  that the uncertainty of data in high latitudes is greater than at higher temperatures.
