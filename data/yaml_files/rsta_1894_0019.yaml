revised_title: On the Photographic Arc Spectrum of Iron Meteorites
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteoritics & Planetary Science
tldr: The author investigates the arc spectrum of iron meteorites Nejed and Obernkirchen,
  comparing their spectra to the solar spectrum and electrolytic iron. The study reveals
  similarities in the number and intensities of lines, suggesting that the temperature
  of iron vapor in the sun is similar to that of the electric arc. The presence of
  various elements in the meteorites is also discussed, with calcium being more prevalent
  in the Nejed meteorite and nickel, barium, and strontium in the Obernkirchen meteorite.
