revised_title: Improving the Method for Determining the Angle of Aperture of Microscopic
  Object-Glasses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a new method for accurately determining the angle of aperture
  of microscopic object-glasses, which involves using a hollow cone and an examining
  microscope to measure the central pencil of rays, excluding oblique pencils. This
  method improves upon the previous method, which was less accurate due to the inclusion
  of oblique rays.
