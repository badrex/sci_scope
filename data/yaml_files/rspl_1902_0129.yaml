revised_title: 'A Study of a Unicellular Green Alga in Polluted Water: Nitrogenous
  Metabolism and Growth Characteristics'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The author investigates a unicellular green alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, found
  in polluted water and studies its nitrogenous metabolism. The alga prefers ammonia
  and ammoniacal compounds over nitrates and grows well in glucose-containing media,
  showing changes in cell structure and color.
