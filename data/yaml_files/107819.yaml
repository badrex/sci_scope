scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the formation and production of pearls, discovering
  that they form on the external surface of an ovum and grow slowly due to their concentric
  layers of nacre. The central cell's nacral shining lining produces the unique lustre
  of pearls, which cannot be replicated in artificial ones.
