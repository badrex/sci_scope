revised_title: 'Deep Sea Rhizopodal Fauna: Discoveries in Foraminifera'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines the deep-sea rhizopodal fauna, specifically Foraminifera,
  and discovers new generic types and varieties within the Lituolida family. These
  findings challenge previous assumptions about the impact of depth and temperature
  on the size of Foraminifera, suggesting that temperature may be a more significant
  factor.
