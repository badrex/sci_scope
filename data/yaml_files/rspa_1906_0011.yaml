revised_title: 'The Periodogram and Its Optical Analogy: A Revised Definition'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a revised definition of the periodogram, which is an optical
  analogy that estimates the intensity of light passing through a central meridian.
  This new definition accounts for the resolving power of the spectroscope and provides
  a more accurate measure of the intensity of incident light.
topics:
- Periodogram
- Spectroscopy
- Optical Analogies
- Spectroscopic Resolution
- Fourier Analysis
