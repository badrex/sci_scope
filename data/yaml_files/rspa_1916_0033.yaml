revised_title: Further Investigations on Osmotic Pressures and Molecular Associations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on osmotic pressures of various sugar and ferrocyanide
  solutions, investigating the effects of molecular associations and solute permeability.
  They find that certain salts, such as magnesium sulfate and magnesium chromate,
  exhibit lower osmotic pressures than predicted by Boyle's Law, suggesting the presence
  of molecular associations.
topics:
- Osmotic Pressure
- Molecular Association
- Solute Permeability
- Sugar Solutions
- Ferrocyanide Solutions
