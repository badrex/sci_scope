revised_title: Energy Required to Produce an Ion in Gases and the Energy of Röntgen
  and Becquerel Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the energy required to produce an ion in gases using
  X-rays and determine the energy of Röntgen and Becquerel rays. They find that the
  mean energy required to produce an ion in air at atmospheric pressure is 1.90 x
  10^-10 erg, and the absorption of X-rays in gases is proportional to the pressure.
