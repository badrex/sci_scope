revised_title: 'On the Mechanical Relations of the Energy of Magnetisation: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors explore the mechanical relations of magnetic energy, focusing on
  the distribution of energy in magnetic fields and the distinction between the energy
  stored in magnetic media and the energy associated with the field in the aether.
  They provide a consistent interpretation of the older theory and discuss the energy
  distribution in various types of magnetic fields.
