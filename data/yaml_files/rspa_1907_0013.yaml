revised_title: Electric or Magnetic Polarisation of a Thin Cylinder of Finite Length
  by a Uniform Field of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author investigates the electric or magnetic polarisation of a thin cylinder
  of finite length in a uniform field of force. They use a series method to calculate
  the polarisation induced in the cylindrical rod and discuss the mean moment and
  mean induction across the central section of the rod.
