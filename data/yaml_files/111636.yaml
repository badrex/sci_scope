revised_title: The Role of Heat in Aerial and Oceanic Currents
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author argues that the heat from condensing vapor is the cause of great
  currents in the air and ocean. He explains that vacua created by condensation enable
  air to flow towards areas of lower pressure, and that the pressure of the wind on
  water can create ocean currents. Heat from vapor is the main force that disturbs
  atmospheric pressure and causes continuous movements in both the atmosphere and
  ocean.
