revised_title: Investigating the Radiation of Helium and Mercury in a Magnetic Field
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the radiation of helium
  and mercury, discovering that the separation between the components of spectral
  lines is proportional to the field intensity. They also observe the Zeeman effect
  and provide a detailed analysis of the experimental setup and results.
