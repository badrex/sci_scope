revised_title: 'Catalytic Actions at Solid Surfaces: The Rate of Change Conditioned
  by a Nickel Catalyst and its Bearing on the Law of Mass Action'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Catalysis
tldr: The authors study the rate of change conditioned by a nickel catalyst and its
  impact on the law of mass action. They investigate the behavior of the nickel catalyst
  under various conditions and compare the results with enzyme actions. The findings
  confirm a previously overlooked theory and provide insights into the linear and
  logarithmic rates of chemical reactions.
