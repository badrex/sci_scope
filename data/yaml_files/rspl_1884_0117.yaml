revised_title: Influence of Temperature on the Heat of Dissolution of Salts in Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the heat of dissolution
  of sodium sulfate in water. The solubility of sodium sulfate increases rapidly from
  ordinary temperatures up to 34Â°C, then decreases rapidly, and becomes nearly stationary
  at higher temperatures. The study aims to understand the condition of sodium sulfate
  in solution at different temperatures.
