revised_title: Experiments on Electricity and Light Emission from QuickSilver in a
  Glass Tube
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author describes experiments conducted by Mr. l'Allamand on the relationship
  between electricity and light emission from quicksilver in a glass tube. The experiments
  show that the friction of mercury against glass can electrify the glass, and that
  the phosphorus of the barometer is not a true phosphorus, but rather an effect of
  the mercury electrifying the tube. The author also mentions the effects of electrification
  on the human body, including sharp pains and increased pulse rate.
