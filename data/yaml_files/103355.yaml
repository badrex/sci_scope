revised_title: An Investigation into the Specific Gravity of Human Blood and its Implications
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the specific gravity
  of human blood and serum, ultimately concluding that the globular part of the blood
  is specifically heavier than the serum, refuting the previous belief that blood
  globules were thin vesicles filled with an aerial substance.
