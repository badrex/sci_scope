revised_title: Optical Activity of Nucleoproteids in Pancreas, Thymus, and Suprarenal
  Gland
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the optical activity of nucleoproteids in the pancreas,
  thymus, and suprarenal gland, discovering that they are dextrorotatory bodies. They
  also discuss the challenges in obtaining pure nucleoproteids for further research
  and the importance of studying the mother nucleoproteid substance.
