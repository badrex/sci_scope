revised_title: A Proposal for Measuring the Parallax of Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Astrometry
tldr: Dr. John Wallis proposes a method to measure the parallax of fixed stars by
  observing their positions relative to the Earth's annual orbit. He suggests using
  circumpolar stars and taking measurements at different times of the year to determine
  the distance of stars from Earth.
