revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Action of Atmospheric Electricity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Atmospheric Chemistry
tldr: Alexander Barry investigates the connection between the chemical constitution
  of substances and their electrical properties. He conducts an experiment using a
  kite and a solution of sulfate of soda, observing the separation of hydrogen and
  oxygen bubbles and the change in color of the liquid. This experiment links the
  research of Dr. Franklin to the electrochemical theory of Sir H. Davy.
