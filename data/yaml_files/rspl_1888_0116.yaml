revised_title: Electrical Resistance of Iron at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: The author investigates the electrical resistance of iron at high temperatures
  and discovers that the temperature coefficient of iron ranges from 0.00048 at the
  ordinary temperature to 0.018 at a temperature just short of 855°C. The study also
  reveals that the iron wire loses its magnetism at a temperature of 870°C, which
  coincides with the discontinuity in the resistance curve.
