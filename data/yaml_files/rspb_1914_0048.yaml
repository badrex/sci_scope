tldr: The study investigates the habits and infectivity of Glossina brevipalpis, a
  tsetse fly species found in Nyasaland, and its role as a carrier of trypanosome
  diseases. The researchers found that wild flies were naturally infected with Trypanosoma
  brucei, Trypanosoma pecorum, and Trypanosoma simice, and that the flies could transmit
  these diseases to healthy animals in experimental settings.
