revised_title: Investigating Osmotic Pressures in Aqueous Solutions of Cane Sugar
  and Methyl Glucoside
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate osmotic pressures in aqueous solutions of cane sugar
  and methyl glucoside using vapor-pressure measurements. They develop a new apparatus
  and method to improve accuracy and general applicability, finding that the experimental
  error is now reduced sufficiently to warrant further research on absolute measurements.
