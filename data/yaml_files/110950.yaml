revised_title: Decomposition of Water by Heat and Voltaic Ignition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy
tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, investigates the decomposition of water using heat and
  voltaic ignition. He discovers that ignited platinum can decompose water into its
  constituent gases without the need for other bodies to absorb the elements. Grove
  also explores various methods of decomposition, including electrical means and oxyhydrogen
  blowpipe, and discusses the theoretical implications of his findings.
