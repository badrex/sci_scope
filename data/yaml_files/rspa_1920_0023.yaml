revised_title: 'A New Method of Spectrophotometry in the Visible and Ultraviolet:
  The Absorption of Light by Silver Bromide'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors develop a new method of spectrophotometry using an optical wedge
  of the absorbing substance, which allows for the measurement of the absorption of
  light by silver bromide. The method is simple, accurate, and can be used to determine
  the extinction coefficient for a wide range of values.
