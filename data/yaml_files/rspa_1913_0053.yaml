revised_title: On Fourier Series and Functions of Bounded Variation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the properties of Fourier series and functions of bounded
  variation, demonstrating how the use of Fourier constants as convergence factors
  can change a Fourier series into another Fourier series while maintaining or altering
  the degree of summability of the associated function.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Functions of bounded variation
- Summability
- Integration
- Trigonometric series
