revised_title: 'The Impact of Hydrogen on the Discharge of Negative Electricity from
  Hot Platinum: A Comprehensive Study'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the effect of hydrogen on the discharge of negative
  electricity from hot platinum. The author examines the changes in the current and
  leak as the platinum wire is heated for extended periods in hydrogen. The findings
  suggest that hydrogen dissolves in the platinum and alters the properties of the
  wire, leading to a better understanding of the chemical reactions occurring at the
  surface.
