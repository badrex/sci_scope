revised_title: Rate of Elimination of Chloroform from the Blood during Anaesthesia
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anaesthesiology & Pain Management
tldr: The authors investigate the rate at which chloroform is eliminated from the
  blood during anaesthesia in cats. They find that the rate of elimination is faster
  than the rate of intake, which helps explain why the chloroform content of the blood
  quickly reaches a maximal value during anaesthesia.
