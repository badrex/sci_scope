scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: This paper investigates the electrolysis of secondary compounds, providing experimental
  evidence in support of the ammonium theory by Berzelius and the binary theory of
  salts by Davy. The authors also discover new facts about the transfer of ions in
  electrolytes and the behavior of various salts during electrolysis.
