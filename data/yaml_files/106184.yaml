revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Boiling on Water's Freezing Point
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: Joseph Black conducts experiments to determine if boiling water freezes more
  readily than non-boiled water. He finds that boiled water freezes faster and attributes
  this to the agitation caused by the air entering the water as it cools, which prevents
  it from reaching a lower temperature without freezing.
