revised_title: Investigating the Law of Extinction of Solar Rays in the Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author examines the transparency of the atmosphere and the extinction of
  solar rays in passing through it. He analyzes previous research and presents his
  own observations, concluding that the absorption of solar rays by the atmosphere
  is significant and that the law of absorption can be represented by a geometric
  progression.
