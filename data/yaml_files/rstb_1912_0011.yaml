tldr: The authors investigate the human electrocardiogram in young male adults, examining
  the curves of 59 healthy subjects to establish a basis for future pathological studies.
  They discuss methods for measuring resistance, standardizing the instrument, and
  determining the safe deflection time of the string for accurate representation of
  current changes.
