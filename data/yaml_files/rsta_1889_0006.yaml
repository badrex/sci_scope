scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the waves and oscillations on a rotating liquid spheroid,
  providing a mathematical analysis of the problem and discussing the nature and frequencies
  of the resulting periodic motions. The study focuses on the stability of the spheroid
  and the effects of angular velocity on the waves.
