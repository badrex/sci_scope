revised_title: Investigations on the Precession of the Equinoxes and Compound Rotatory
  Motion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, examines the precession of the equinoxes and compound
  rotatory motion, discussing the work of Sir Isaac Newton and other mathematicians.
  He investigates the principles of compound rotatory motion and calculates the angular
  velocity produced by the disturbing solar force on the spheroidal figure of the
  earth, as well as the quantity of annual precession and nutation.
