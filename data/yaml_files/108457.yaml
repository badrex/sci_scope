tldr: The author examines the levels of sulphates and phosphates in the urine of patients
  with various diseases, including acute chorea, delirium tremens, and inflammatory
  diseases of the nervous structures. The study reveals that in acute chorea, the
  amount of sulphates in the urine is increased, while phosphates may be remarkably
  diminished. In delirium tremens, sulphates are often above average, while phosphates
  are below average. In acute inflammatory diseases of the nervous structures, both
  sulphates and phosphates may be elevated.
