revised_title: Investigating the Magnetic Properties of Hot-Rolled and Cold-Rolled
  Malleable Iron
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the difference in magnetic properties
  between hot-rolled and cold-rolled malleable iron. The results show that cold-rolled
  iron has a stronger ability to retain induced magnetism, suggesting potential implications
  for iron-based materials in various applications.
