revised_title: Investigation of Solar and Diurnal Inequalities in Tides at Liverpool
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Sciences
tldr: The author, William Whewell, examines the solar and diurnal inequalities in
  tides at Liverpool, tracing the correspondence of these observations with the equilibrium
  theory. He also investigates the effects of the Moon's declination on tides and
  presents methods for calculating the solar inequalities in terms of height and time
  of high water.
