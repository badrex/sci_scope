revised_title: 'Anatomy and Physiology of Parasitic and Free Nematoids: Zoological
  Position and Affinities to Echinoderms'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author examines the anatomy and physiology of parasitic and free nematoids,
  discussing their zoological position and affinities to echinoderms. The study focuses
  on the tegumentary organs, nervous systems, digestive organs, and excretory systems
  of nematoids, as well as their resilience to desiccation. The author suggests that
  nematoids may be an aberrant division of the class Echinodermata, connecting the
  two groups through shared characteristics.
