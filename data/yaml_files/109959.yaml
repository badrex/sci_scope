revised_title: Inaudibility of Certain Sounds in Some Ears
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a phenomenon of insensitivity
  to certain sounds in some individuals. He observes that certain tones are inaudible
  to some ears, even when the individuals are not otherwise deaf. Wollaston also discusses
  the range of human hearing, which includes more than nine octaves, and speculates
  about the possibility of other animals and insects perceiving sounds beyond the
  range of human hearing.
