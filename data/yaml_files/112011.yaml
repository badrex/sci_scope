revised_title: Effects of Impact, Vibratory Action, and Load Changes on Wrought-Iron
  Girders
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Infrastructure
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the effects of impact, vibratory
  action, and long-term load changes on wrought-iron girders. The results show that
  girders of ordinary construction are not safe when subjected to violent disturbances
  equivalent to one-third the weight that would break them, but they exhibit great
  resilience when subjected to one-fourth the load.

- Bridge Engineering
- Wrought Iron
