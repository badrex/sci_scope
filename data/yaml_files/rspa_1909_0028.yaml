revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Recoil in Radium Transformations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors provide experimental evidence of the recoil effect in radium transformations,
  demonstrating that radium A, B, and C atoms can travel considerable distances through
  evacuated spaces when formed from the emanation and expelled as a-particles.
