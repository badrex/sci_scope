  Confirmation'

tldr: The author describes an experiment conducted by Robert Boyle, in which he injected
  acid liquors into blood to observe its effects. The experiment demonstrated that
  certain acids, such as aqua-fortis and oil of vitriol, coagulate blood, while others,
  like the spirit of sal ammoniac, preserve its fluidity and color. Signor Fracassati
  later confirmed these findings, further expanding on the experiment's implications
  for blood chemistry and anatomy.
