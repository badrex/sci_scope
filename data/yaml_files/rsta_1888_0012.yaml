revised_title: The Influence of Compression on the Magnetic Qualities of Nickel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: This study investigates the effects of compressive stress on the magnetic properties
  of nickel, revealing that compression increases the magnetic susceptibility and
  retentiveness of the material. The results show that compressive stress enhances
  the magnetic permeability and the ratio of residual to induced magnetism, while
  tensile stress has the opposite effect.
