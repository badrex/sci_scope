  and Bladders

scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine if fluids pass directly
  from the stomach to the blood and into the spleen, gall bladder, and urinary bladder
  without going through the thoracic duct. The experiments show that fluids do not
  pass through the spleen or the thoracic duct, but instead enter the circulation
  and are deposited in the cells of the spleen and liver.
