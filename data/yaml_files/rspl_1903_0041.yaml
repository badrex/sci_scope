revised_title: Investigating the Intensely Penetrating Y-Rays of Radium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The author investigates the intensely penetrating y-rays emitted by radium and
  compares their ionization effects on various gases. The results show that y-rays
  have similar ionization properties to other types of radiation, suggesting they
  may also be corpuscular in nature.
