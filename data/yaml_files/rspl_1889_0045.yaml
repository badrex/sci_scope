revised_title: The Role of Barium Sulphate in the Durability of Sandstone
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geomorphology
tldr: This study investigates the presence of barium sulphate in sandstone from the
  Keuper basement beds of the Trias formation and its role in the resistance to weathering.
  The research finds that the barium sulphate acts as a cement, binding the sand grains
  together and providing durability to the sandstone structures, such as the Hemlock
  Stone and Bramcote Hill.
