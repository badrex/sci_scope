revised_title: An Experiment to Determine the Velocity of Light in Different Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author proposes an experiment to determine the velocity of light in different
  media by observing the aberration of fixed stars through a telescope filled with
  a dense fluid. The experiment aims to test Sir Isaac Newton's ideas about the cause
  of refraction and provide evidence for his principles.
