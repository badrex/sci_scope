revised_title: The Effect of Salt Concentration on Hemolysis and Complement Inactivation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: This study investigates the influence of salt concentration on hemolysis and
  the interaction between red blood cells, complement, and antibodies. The results
  confirm that increased salt concentration inhibits the combination of complement
  with sensitized red blood cells, and this effect can be partially counteracted by
  increasing the concentration of the hemolytic antibody or complement. The findings
  also suggest that in hypotonic solutions, the amount of antibody needed to cause
  lysis may be reduced, and complement may combine with red blood cells without the
  involvement of hemolytic antibody in mixtures with low or no ionizable salt.
