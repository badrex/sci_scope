revised_title: 'The Influence of Solvent on the Position of Absorption Bands in Solutions:
  A Study of Fuchsin'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Molecular Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate how the solvent affects the position of absorption bands
  in solutions, focusing on fuchsin. They find that the position of maximum absorption
  is dependent on the density and optical nature of the medium, and that the displacement
  of absorption bands is influenced by the refractive index of the solvent.
