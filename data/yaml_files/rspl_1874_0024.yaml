revised_title: The Effect of Hydrogen and Acids on the Physical Properties of Iron
  and Steel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effects of hydrogen and acids on the physical properties
  of iron and steel, discovering that immersion in certain acids causes a temporary
  decrease in toughness and the evolution of hydrogen gas. The phenomenon is more
  pronounced in steel than in iron, and the author suggests that hydrogen may be the
  primary cause of these changes.
