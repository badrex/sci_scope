revised_title: Further Observations on the Electromotive Properties of the Electrical
  Organ of Torpedo marmorata
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the electrical organ
  of Torpedo marmorata and discovers that the organ responds to the passage of an
  induction shock, regardless of its direction. The experiments show that the phenomena
  of 'irreciprocal conduction' are actually excitatory phenomena, with the organ's
  response affecting the galvanometric readings.
