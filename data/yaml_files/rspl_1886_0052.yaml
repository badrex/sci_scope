revised_title: A Simplified Method for Computing Harmonic Components in Atmospheric
  Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Lieut.-General Strachey proposes a less laborious method for computing the harmonic
  components of atmospheric temperature and pressure variations, which provides nearly
  the same probable errors as the method of least squares. This method can be applied
  to cases with angular intervals that make the circle exactly divisible by 6 and
  8.
