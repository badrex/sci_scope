revised_title: 'The Respiratory Process in Muscle and the Nature of Muscular Motion:
  A Reevaluation of the Inogen Theory'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors challenge the inogen theory, which states that muscular energy is
  derived from the explosive splitting of a molecular complex containing oxygen. They
  present evidence from their experiments on isolated frog muscles, showing that the
  production of carbon dioxide does not increase during muscle contraction, contrary
  to the theory's predictions. They argue that the current understanding of cell metabolism
  and respiration needs to be reevaluated.
