revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Reaction Between Permanganic Acid and Oxalic
  Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical reaction between permanganic acid and oxalic
  acid, examining the effects of varying the amounts of sulfuric acid, manganous sulfate,
  and oxalic acid on the reaction rate and amount of chemical change. They find that
  the reaction rate is influenced by the presence of manganous sulfate and that the
  amount of chemical change is affected by the concentration of sulfuric acid.
