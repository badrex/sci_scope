  on Electromagnetic Waves
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on the discharge of Leyden jars
  and the influence of different conductors on electromagnetic waves. The results
  show that the choice of conductor and the presence of alternative paths can affect
  the strength and nature of the electrical discharge.
