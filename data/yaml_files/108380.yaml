scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author examines the anatomy and function of the auditory organ in crustaceans,
  specifically focusing on the true organ of hearing located in the base of the lesser
  pair of antennae. The organ consists of a vestibular sac filled with siliceous sand
  particles and lined with ciliated processes, which are innervated by a separate
  auditory nerve originating from the supra-oesophageal ganglion.
