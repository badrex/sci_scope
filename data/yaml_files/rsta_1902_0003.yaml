revised_title: The Measurement of Ionic Velocities in Aqueous Solutions and the Existence
  of Complex Ions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the measurement of ionic velocities in aqueous solutions
  and the existence of complex ions. They discuss the transport number, molecular
  conductivity, and the influence of concentration on these properties. The study
  confirms that only a limited number of salts have transport numbers independent
  of concentration.
topics:
- Ionic velocities
- Transport number
- Electrolytes
- Conductivity
- Complex ions
