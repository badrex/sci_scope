revised_title: Re-Measurement of Cube, Cylinder, and Sphere for Standard Weights and
  Measures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Measurement & Instrumentation
tldr: The author re-measures the cube, cylinder, and sphere used by Sir George Shuckburgh
  Evelyn in his experiments for determining a standard of weights and measures. The
  measurements are taken using a micrometer microscope and compared to the original
  values, ensuring accuracy and precision in the determination of a standard.
