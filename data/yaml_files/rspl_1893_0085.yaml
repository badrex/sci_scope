revised_title: 'On the Whirling and Vibration of Shafts: Theoretical Investigations
  and Experimental Verification'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Dynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the whirling and vibration of shafts, focusing on the
  effects of pulleys and the critical speed at which a shaft will begin to whirl.
  They develop mathematical formulas and conduct experiments to verify their findings,
  providing insights into the behavior of shafts in various engineering applications.
