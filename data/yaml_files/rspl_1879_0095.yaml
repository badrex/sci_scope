revised_title: A Reassessment of Protagon Composition and Its Relation to Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Neurochemistry
tldr: The author examines the composition of protagon, a substance found in the brain,
  and refutes recent claims that it is a mixture of various organic substances, including
  potassium. The author's research confirms the consistency of protagon's composition,
  even after multiple recrystallizations, and questions the validity of previous analyses
  that attributed potassium to protagon.
