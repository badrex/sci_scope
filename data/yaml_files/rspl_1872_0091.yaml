revised_title: Electric Decomposition of Carbonic-Acid Gas and the Identity of Ozone
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electric decomposition of carbonic-acid gas and
  discovers that the ozone formed is identical to that generated from pure oxygen.
  The study reveals that the greatest proportion of ozone is produced when a rapid
  current of dry carbonic-acid gas is acted upon at a low temperature by electricity
  of feeble tension.
