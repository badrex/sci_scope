revised_title: The Formation of Continuous Tabular Masses of Stony Lava on Steep Slopes
  and the Origin of Mount Etna
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Volcanology
tldr: The author investigates the formation of continuous tabular masses of stony
  lava on steep slopes and challenges the prevailing theory that such slopes cannot
  form solid, continuous layers. Through his observations and research, Sir Charles
  Lyell discovers examples of modern lavas forming such layers on slopes of up to
  40 degrees, questioning the widely held belief that great volcanic mountains are
  primarily formed by upward forces acting from below.
