revised_title: An Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Sound
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author describes an experimental method to determine the velocity of sound
  using a chronograph and discusses the effects of temperature and atmospheric conditions
  on the velocity of sound. The results show a close agreement with previous values
  and provide insights into the relationship between sound velocity and temperature.
