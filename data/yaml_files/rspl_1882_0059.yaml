revised_title: Investigating the Dark Plane Formed Over a Heated Wire in Dusty Air
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author examines the formation of a dark plane of air above a heated wire
  in a dusty atmosphere. They propose that the heated wire causes the air to rise,
  separating it from the dust particles, creating a dark band of clean air. This phenomenon
  is not due to the evaporation of dust particles or the increase in air density.
