revised_title: The Microsporangia of Pteridosperms and Cycadojilices
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the microsporangia of pteridosperms and cycadojilices, discussing
  their identity, structure, and affinities. They conclude that cycadofilices, which
  predate the advent of true ferns, cannot have been derived from them and may have
  been derived from the Botryopterideae instead.
