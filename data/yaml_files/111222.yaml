revised_title: 'Viviparity in Toads and Frogs: Evidence of Reproduction without Tadpole
  Stage'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: Edward Joseph Lowe presents evidence of toads and frogs reproducing without
  the intermediate tadpole stage, suggesting that they can be viviparous or reproduce
  directly from the egg. This challenges the generally accepted notion that these
  animals are solely oviparous.
