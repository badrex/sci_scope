revised_title: Investigating the Relation between Film Thickness and Surface Tension
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: Reinold and Rucker investigate the relationship between the thickness and surface
  tension of liquid films, comparing black films to colored films with varying thickness.
  They find that the differences in surface tension are small and not directly related
  to the film's color or thickness, suggesting that other factors may be at play.
