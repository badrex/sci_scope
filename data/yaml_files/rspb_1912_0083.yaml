scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathogen Biology
tldr: The author investigates the transmission and infection of Trypanosoma pecorum
  and T. uniforme in antelopes, discovering that laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis
  are uncertain carriers and that antelopes can act as reservoirs for the trypanosome.
  The study highlights the challenges in understanding the true carriers and the factors
  affecting the infection and transmission of these parasites.
