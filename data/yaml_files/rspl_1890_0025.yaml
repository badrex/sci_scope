revised_title: Investigating the Nebula of Orion's Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of the Orion Nebula using a siderostat
  and a spectroscope, confirming the coincidence of the nebula line with the iron
  line at 4956.8 and the magnesium fluting at A 500. The study aims to determine the
  actual wavelength of the nebula line and understand the nature of the nebula.
