scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric & Environmental Chemistry
tldr: John Dalton examines the distribution of atmospheric components at different
  heights using the atomic theory and Newton's law of repulsion. He concludes that
  each gas forms a separate atmospheric column, and suggests a method to determine
  the absolute height of a specific gas in the atmosphere.
