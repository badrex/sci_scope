revised_title: Comparative Photographic Analysis of Stars' Spectra to the 3rd Magnitude
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Celestial Objects
tldr: The author examines photographic spectra of stars up to the 3rd magnitude, analyzing
  their distribution and classification. The study suggests that stars of more advanced
  spectra are more evenly distributed in space, and proposes that the sun may be situated
  near the lower boundary of the galaxy.
