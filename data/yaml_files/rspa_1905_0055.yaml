revised_title: Investigations on the Pressure of Explosions and Combustion of Cordite
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This study investigates the pressure and combustion of solid and gaseous explosives,
  particularly focusing on cordite. The research confirms that combustion of cordite
  proceeds according to parallel surfaces, and the rate at which the flame travels
  is proportional to the pressure. The paper also discusses the effect of the explosive's
  diameter, the rate of cooling, and the influence of enclosure shapes on the maximum
  pressure developed.
