  Silkworms

tldr: This study investigates the effects of light and darkness on the development
  and growth of silkworms. The experiments show that the mean period of metamorphosis
  in the darkened cell was 18 days and 15 hours, while in the light cell, it was 17
  days and 16 hours. The results suggest that the direct agency of light has little
  effect on the development, growth, nutrition, and coloration of animals.
