revised_title: On the Contact of Conics and Quadric Surfaces with Given Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The authors explore the contact problems of conics and quadric surfaces with
  given surfaces, providing general formulas and determining the number of points
  at which a quadric can have four-branch contact with the surface.

- Geometry
- Contact Geometry
- Conic Sections
- Quadric Surfaces
