revised_title: On the Development of the Disturbing Function and its Impact on Planetary
  Motions
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the development of the disturbing function and its impact
  on planetary motions caused by mutual attraction. The research focuses on expanding
  the function to enable astronomers to compute coefficients of arguments for inequalities
  in planetary motions with less difficulty and more accuracy.
