revised_title: Investigating Electrical Phenomena in Muscular Contraction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the electrical phenomena accompanying muscular contraction
  and finds that during contraction, there is a current or instantaneous electrical
  discharge in a contrary direction to the relaxed muscle's current. The study uses
  various experimental methods and setups to investigate and validate these findings.
