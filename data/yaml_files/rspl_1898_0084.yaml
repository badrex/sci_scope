tldr: The author investigates the topographical anatomy of the abdominal viscera,
  focusing on the gastro-intestinal canal in humans. They develop a method for surface
  marking the abdomen that is independent of variable surface points and provides
  reliable landmarks. The study examines the relations of the viscera to one another
  and the forces that maintain or alter these relations.
