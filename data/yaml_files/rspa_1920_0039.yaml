revised_title: 'The Supply of Energy from and to Atmospheric Eddies: An Extension
  of Reynolds'' Theory of Turbulence'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author extends Osborne Reynolds' theory of turbulence to include the case
  where work is done by eddies acting as thermodynamic engines in a gravitating atmosphere.
  The study focuses on the supply of energy to and from atmospheric eddies, considering
  factors such as temperature changes, radiation, and molecular viscosity.
topics:
- Atmospheric Eddies
- Turbulence
- Energy Transfer
- Thermodynamics
- Atmospheric Physics
