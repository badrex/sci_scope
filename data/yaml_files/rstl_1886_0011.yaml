revised_title: Effects of Stress and Magnetisation on the Thermoelectric Quality of
  Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of stress and magnetisation on the thermoelectric
  quality of iron, discovering that the initial effect of loading an annealed iron
  wire is negative, but as the load is increased beyond the limit of elasticity, the
  effect changes to positive.
