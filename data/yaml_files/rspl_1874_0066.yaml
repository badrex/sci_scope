scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: This article by Prof. Cayley discusses prepotentials, a concept related to potential
  theory, and presents distribution theorems that help in understanding the behavior
  of forces and densities in various dimensions. The author also refers to the work
  of other mathematicians like Green, Gauss, and Dirichlet in this field.
