revised_title: Studies on the Electric Arc and Formation of Cyanogen Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electric arc and its effects on the formation of
  cyanogen compounds, hydrocyanic acid, and nitrites. Experiments with carbon tubes
  and various gases reveal that the presence of hydrogen and nitrogen in the carbon
  and air play a significant role in the formation of these compounds.
