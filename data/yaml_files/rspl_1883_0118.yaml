revised_title: 'Surface Forces in Fluids: A New Approach to Understanding Capillarity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author examines the surface forces in fluids, focusing on the relationship
  between surface tension, molecular attraction, and repulsion. They demonstrate how
  surface forces affect the equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a solid, gas, or
  its own vapor, and explain the phenomena of capillarity.
topics:
- Surface Forces
- Capillarity
- Fluid Mechanics
- Surface Tension
- Molecular Equilibrium
