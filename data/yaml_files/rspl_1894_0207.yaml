revised_title: Oscillations of a Rotating Ellipsoidal Shell Containing Fluid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author applies Poincar√©'s analysis to determine the free oscillations of
  a fluid mass contained within a rigid ellipsoidal envelope rotating around one of
  its principal axes. The paper demonstrates that the disturbances of the fluid can
  be expressed using Lame functions, and provides a method to obtain the frequencies
  of these oscillations.
