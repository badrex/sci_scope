revised_title: Investigating the Principle of Acidity and the Composition of Water
  in Relation to Phlogiston
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the composition of water and the
  role of phlogiston in chemical reactions. He finds that the acid produced from the
  reaction of dephlogisticated and inflammable air is not solely due to the presence
  of phlogisticated air, and that the acid is a necessary result of the union of these
  two types of air.
