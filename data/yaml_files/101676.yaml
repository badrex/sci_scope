revised_title: Ebullition and Air Generation in Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions &amp; Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors experiment with mixing various liquids in a vacuum and observe the
  ebullition and air generation that occurs. They find that certain mixtures, such
  as Aqua fortis and Spirit of Wine, create a new type of air when mixed in a vacuum,
  while others, like Oil of Tartar and Oil of Vitriol, do not maintain their air generation
  over time.
