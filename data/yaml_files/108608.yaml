revised_title: Investigating the Stability of Loose Earth through Frictional Forces
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geotechnical Engineering & Soil Mechanics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for the stability of loose earth based
  on the friction between its separate grains, without relying on any assumptions
  or artifices. The study deduces the laws of stability from a single principle and
  provides equations for calculating the necessary conditions for a granular mass
  to maintain stability.
