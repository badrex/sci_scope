revised_title: Investigating Dielectric Constants of Metallic Oxides in Ice at Low
  Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Dielectric Materials
tldr: Dewar and Fleming studied the dielectric constants of metallic oxides dissolved
  or suspended in ice cooled to liquid air temperatures. They found that the dielectric
  constants of ice with suspended or dissolved metallic oxides were significantly
  higher than those of pure ice, and that the electrical conductivity of these mixtures
  was generally low.
