scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the development of the Naturally Infected Dog strain
  of trypanosome in the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans. They find that the trypanosome
  develops in the alimentary tract and salivary glands of the fly, similar to the
  Trypanosoma brucei and gambiense group. The study contributes to understanding the
  transmission and life cycle of the trypanosome causing disease in humans in Nyasaland.
