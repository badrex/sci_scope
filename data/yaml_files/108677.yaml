revised_title: The Pigmentary System and Color Changes in Frogs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the cutaneous pigmentary system of frogs, discovering
  that the skin's color changes are due to the concentration and diffusion of pigment
  within chromatophorous cells. The study also reveals the role of these cells in
  the frog's ability to change color in response to environmental factors.
