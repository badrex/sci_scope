tldr: Robert Boyle receives a letter detailing the discovery that ambergris, a valuable
  substance, is produced by a tree found near the sea. The tree's roots grow towards
  the water to provide warmth, allowing the gum to be released and float on the sea
  surface. This information comes from a Dutch East Indian Journal and could potentially
  be used for cultivation and extraction of ambergris.
