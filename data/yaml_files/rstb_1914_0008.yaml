tldr: This study investigates the hybridization of echinoids and the inheritance of
  larval skeletal characters. The researchers successfully crossed different species
  of sea urchins and found that certain characters were inherited differently in hybrids,
  highlighting the importance of using fixed and definite characters in studying inheritance.
