tldr: The author describes a new type of Bennettitalean flower, Williamsoniella, found
  in the Gristhorpe plant-bed of the Middle Jurassic period. The flower has a unique
  structure with a central axis, male sporophylls, and a crown-like appearance at
  the summit. The discovery of this new type of flower contributes to the understanding
  of the reproductive structures of Bennettitales and their role in the Mesozoic period.
