revised_title: 'A Method of Drawing Extremely Fine Wires: The Case of Platinum'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a method of drawing extremely
  fine wires using platinum, which can be coated with silver for better application
  in astronomical instruments. The process involves reducing the diameter of the wire
  while increasing its tenacity, and the author discusses the challenges and techniques
  involved in handling such delicate wires.
