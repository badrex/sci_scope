scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences
tldr: Henry Cavendish investigates the height of the luminous arch observed in 1784,
  using observations from multiple locations. He concludes that the height is likely
  between 52 and 71 statute miles, and suggests that these arches may consist of parallel
  streams of light forming a long, thin band.
