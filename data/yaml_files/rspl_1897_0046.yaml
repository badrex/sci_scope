scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Biology & Anthropology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between sexual variation, sexual correlation,
  and the level of civilization in different races. They analyze measurements of long
  bones in French, Aino, and Japanese populations and find that civilised men have
  more variation than uncivilised men, while civilised women have slightly more variation
  than civilised men. The study also reveals that the correlation between sexual variation
  and the level of civilization is more complex than previously thought.
