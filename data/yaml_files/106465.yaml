revised_title: Investigating the Collision of Bodies and the True Doctrine of Mechanic
  Power
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Applied Physics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the collision of bodies and challenges the
  widely accepted belief that the velocity of non-elastic hard bodies after a collision
  is the same as that of non-elastic soft bodies. He demonstrates that the velocity
  after the collision depends on the nature of the bodies and their elasticity, providing
  a new perspective on the true doctrine of mechanic power.
