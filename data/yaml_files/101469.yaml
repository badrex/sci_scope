  of the First Comet

tldr: English astronomers examine the dispute between Hevelius and Auzout regarding
  the observation of the first of two comets. They conclude that the comet did not
  pass near the star in the left ear of Aries, as claimed by Hevelius, but rather
  near the bright star in its left horn according to Bayer's tables. The observations
  of other astronomers, including French, Italian, and Dutch, support this conclusion.
