tldr: The author investigates the properties and chemical reactions of octyl compounds,
  specifically comparing those derived from petroleum and castor oil. They find that
  the octyl alcohol from both sources is primarily methyl-hexyl carbinol, and that
  their oxidation products are the same, including methyl-oenanthol and caproic and
  acetic acids. The author also identifies differences in the hydrocarbon composition
  between the two sources.
