revised_title: Magnetic Needle Irregularities and Geological Structure
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the irregularities in the magnetic needle's indications
  due to temperature differences and suggests improvements for experiments. He also
  explores the relationship between terrestrial magnetism, geological structure, and
  thermo-electrical currents, concluding that these factors may influence each other
  and contribute to the Earth's magnetic phenomena.
