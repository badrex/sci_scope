revised_title: A New Design for Aerial Telescopes
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Observational Techniques
tldr: The author presents a new design for an aerial telescope that reduces the size
  and weight of the instrument, making it more manageable for astronomical observations.
  The design involves cutting or removing most of the tube, leaving only a small part
  near the objective glass and another towards the eyepiece. The author also provides
  solutions to potential issues, such as maintaining the eyepiece's position and finding
  the objective glass in the dark.
