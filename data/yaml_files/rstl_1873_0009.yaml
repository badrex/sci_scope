tldr: The authors conducted a magnetic survey of Belgium in 1871, collecting data
  on the elements of terrestrial magnetism at various stations. They used barrow dip-circle,
  Jones unifilar, Frodsham chronometer, and a theodolite to gather information. The
  results were used to determine the lines of equal Dip, Declination, and Intensity,
  and to calculate the distance between stations with differing Dips.
