revised_title: Investigations on the Limits of Algebraic Equations and Des Cartes'
  Rule
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author examines the limitations of algebraic equations and the applicability
  of Des Cartes' rule for determining the number of affirmative and negative roots.
  The study reveals that the rule may not always hold true, and that the equation
  (B) may have imaginary roots even when the original equation (A) has only real roots.
