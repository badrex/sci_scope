revised_title: The Invariance of Argon Percentage in Breathed and Atmospheric Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Gas Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the percentage of argon in atmospheric and respired
  air and find that the proportion of argon to nitrogen remains nearly the same even
  when the air composition is significantly altered during respiration. This suggests
  that argon plays a minimal role in the animal economy, serving only as a diluent.
