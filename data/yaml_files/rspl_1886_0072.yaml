scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the origin of uric acid in the animal body and proposes
  that it is formed by the kidney cells as ammonium urate. The presence of sodium
  urate in the blood is believed to be a result of a slight absorption of ammonium
  urate from the kidneys into the blood.
