revised_title: Experimental Inquiry into the Strength of Wrought-Iron Plates and Riveted
  Joints in Ship-Building
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the strength of wrought-iron plates and their riveted
  joints in ship-building through a series of experiments. The results show that iron
  ships are more buoyant, safer, and more durable than those built with wood. The
  study also compares the strength of plates to bar iron and provides insights into
  the best methods of riveting and the proportional strength of rivets and joints.
