scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryology
tldr: The author investigates the physical and optical properties of ice, discovering
  the formation of unique flower-shaped figures and liquid disks within the ice due
  to solar heat absorption. The experiments reveal the inhomogeneous nature of ice
  and its impact on melting and freezing temperatures.
