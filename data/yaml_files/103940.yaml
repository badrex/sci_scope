scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: John Eames and Dr. Desaguliers discuss the existence of magnets with more than
  two poles, presenting various experiments and observations. They conclude that magnets
  with multiple poles are composed of an aggregate of magnetic and non-magnetic materials,
  making them heterogeneous substances.
