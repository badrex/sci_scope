revised_title: Extinction of Flames and Respirable Atmospheres
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
tldr: The author presents a list of various studies and findings related to the extinction
  of flames, the composition of atmospheres, and the respiration of humans. The author
  discusses the similarities between the atmosphere produced by the combustion of
  flames and the air expired from the lungs, and how the extinction of a flame does
  not necessarily indicate the unsuitability of an atmosphere for respiration.
topics:
- Combustion
- Respiration
- Atmospheric Composition
