  Spontaneous Nitrification
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Bonding
tldr: The author investigates the formation of nitric acid and the role of ozone in
  spontaneous nitrification. They propose that ozone, a powerful oxidizing agent,
  may be responsible for the transformation of nitrogen into nitric acid during the
  putrefaction of azotic organic matters.
