scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author describes two groups of prismatic basaltine columns in the Venetian
  State, Italy, and compares them to the famous Giant's Causeway in Ireland. The columns
  differ in form, size, texture, and quality, with those of Monte Rosso having a more
  oblong or oval shape and a rough surface compared to the smoother, more circular
  columns of San Giovanni. The author also discusses the geological and physical geography
  context of these formations and their potential implications for understanding the
  origin of granites.
