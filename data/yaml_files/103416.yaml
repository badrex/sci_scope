revised_title: On the Refraction of Air and Its Impact on Astronomical Observations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: Dr. Edm. Halley discusses the impact of air refraction on astronomical observations
  and presents a table to help account for the effect of refraction on the apparent
  distances of stars. He explains that the refraction of the air causes the distances
  of stars to appear smaller than their true distances, and this effect is more pronounced
  for stars closer to the horizon.
