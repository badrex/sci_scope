revised_title: Investigation of the Apparent Magnetism in Metallic Titanium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines the apparent magnetism of metallic
  titanium and finds that the attraction is likely due to the presence of iron as
  an alloy in the titanium. He compares the magnetic forces of titanium, cobalt, and
  nickel, and concludes that titanium's magnetism can be explained by the presence
  of iron.
