revised_title: Tonometrical Observations on Non-Harmonic Musical Scales
scientific_discipline: Musicology
scientific_subdiscipline: Musical Acoustics & Theory
tldr: The authors present tonometrical observations on various non-harmonic musical
  scales, measuring the actual pitch of notes using tuning forks and comparing them
  to existing theoretical accounts. They provide a brief table for converting tabular
  logarithms into cents, allowing for more precise comparison and analysis of these
  scales.

- Musical Scales
- Tonometry
- Harmonic and No
- Tuning Forks
