scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: A. Matthiessen investigates the electric conducting power of over 200 alloys
  and categorizes them into two classes based on their conductivity. He also identifies
  three groups of alloys and discusses their properties, concluding that some alloys
  are solutions, chemical combinations, or mechanical mixtures.
