revised_title: A Reevaluation of Professor Hermann's Capillary Electrometer Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author critiques Professor Hermann's capillary electrometer theory, arguing
  that the mathematical formula does not necessarily prove the correctness of the
  hypothesis. Burch emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between
  electrical and mechanical forces in the electrometer and questions the assumptions
  made about polarization and electrolysis.
