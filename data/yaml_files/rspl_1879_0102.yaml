revised_title: Electrolytic Experiments with Intermittent Currents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The author investigates the effects of intermittent currents on electrolytic
  experiments using the de Meritens magneto-electric machine. The experiments reveal
  that the rapid alternation of the current prevents decomposition in dilute sulfuric
  acid, while rapid current changes with a tuning fork or aluminum wire produce intense
  luminosity and decomposition. The author also discusses the behavior of various
  metals and solutions under these conditions.
