revised_title: On the General Nature and Relation of Electric and Magnetic Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, investigates the relationship between electric
  and magnetic forces through a series of experiments. He explores the nature of inductive
  action and polarization in insulating bodies, as well as the role of compound particles
  in electrolysis. Faraday concludes that the theory of inductive action provides
  a more satisfactory explanation for the nature of electric and magnetic forces than
  the previous theories.
