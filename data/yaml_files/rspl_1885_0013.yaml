revised_title: 'Dissociation and Evaporation of Substances: A Study on Chloral Hydrate,
  Chloral Methyl, Ethyl Alcoholates, Ammonium Carbonate, Ammonium Chloride, Aldehyde
  Ammonia, Phthalic Acid, Succinic Acid, Nitric Peroxide, and Acetic Acid'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the evaporation and dissociation of various substances,
  including chloral hydrate, chloral methyl, and ethyl alcoholates, and find that
  the behavior of these substances can be divided into two classes based on their
  vapor pressure and dissociation curves. They also observe that the degree of dissociation
  affects the temperature of volatilization and the formation of pressure curves.
