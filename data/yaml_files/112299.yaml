revised_title: Equations of Rotation of a Solid Body
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author develops the fundamental formulas of transformation and integration
  for the equations of rotation of a solid body about a fixed point, using various
  systems of coordinates. The integrals found involve cubic equations and linear functions
  of the components of rotation.
topics:
- Solid Mechanics
- Rotation Theory
- Transformations
