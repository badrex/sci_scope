tldr: The author examines the colouring matters in the compound ascidian Diazona violacea
  and concludes that the green colour likely results from a chlorophyll-like body,
  possibly due to a symbiotic alga. The study also explores the differences in pigments
  between the outer and inner portions of the organism.
