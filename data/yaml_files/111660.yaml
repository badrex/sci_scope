revised_title: Investigating Luminous Discharge of Voltaic Batteries in Carbonic Acid
  Vacua
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author examines the luminous discharge of voltaic batteries in carbonic
  acid vacua and describes the appearance and character of the induced discharge in
  various vacuum tubes. The experiments reveal that the discharge from the water battery
  is continuous and stratified, while the discharge from the nitric acid battery is
  intermittent and spark-like.
