revised_title: Investigating the Motion of Glass Threads and the Effluvia of Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Physics of Fluids & Gas
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the motion of glass threads and the effluvia
  of glass, discovering that the approach of a hand or other object can cause motion
  at a distance. The author also investigates the role of air and atmospheric pressure
  in these phenomena.
topics:
- Effluvia
- Glass Physics
- Atmospheric Pressure
- Vacuum
- Attraction and Repulsion
