revised_title: 'On the Ultra-Violet Spectra of Cobalt and Nickel: Part III'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the ultra-violet spectra of cobalt and nickel using
  diffraction gratings and spectroscopy. They find that while both elements have a
  large number of lines, there is no definite correspondence in their spectra beyond
  a general resemblance to iron. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the
  wave-lengths of cobalt and nickel lines, with implications for understanding their
  chemical and physical properties.
