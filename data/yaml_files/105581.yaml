revised_title: A Theorem of the Aberration of Light Refracted Through a Lens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a theorem that calculates the angular aberration of light
  rays refracted through a lens due to the imperfection of its spherical figure. This
  theorem can be applied to correct aberrations in combined object lenses.
