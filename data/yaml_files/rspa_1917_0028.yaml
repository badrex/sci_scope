revised_title: X-ray Analysis of Rutile and Cassiterite Crystal Structures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The authors use X-ray analysis to investigate the crystal structures of rutile
  and cassiterite, finding that the spacing of the 001 planes in both crystals is
  half of what is expected. They propose three possible lattices that could explain
  the results and discuss the intensities of different orders to further test these
  lattices.
