scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrochemistry
tldr: Dr. Miles discusses the nature of electrical fire and its relation to luminous
  effluvia. He considers various hypotheses, including the possibility that the fire
  comes from the excited tube or from principles in the air. He also explores the
  connection between electrical and luminous effluvia and the role of the subtle,
  active, elastic substance proposed by Sir Isaac Newton.
