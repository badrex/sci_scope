revised_title: Observations on Luminous Flesh and its Properties
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: Robert Boyle observes luminous flesh in a piece of meat and conducts various
  experiments to understand its properties. He finds that the luminous parts of the
  meat do not produce heat, are not affected by touch, and are not putrefied. The
  light emitted by the meat is not extinguished by compression or glass, but is quenched
  by high rectified spirit of wine and water. Boyle also attempts to reproduce the
  phenomenon using a pneumatical engine, with mixed results.
