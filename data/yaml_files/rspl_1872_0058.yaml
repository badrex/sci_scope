revised_title: The Influence of Pressure and Electrical Discharge on Gas Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of pressure on the spectra of gases and find
  that the production of line-spectra and the expansion of hydrogen lines are not
  solely dependent on gas density. They attribute these changes to the intensity of
  the electrical charge communicated to a Leyden jar during the experiment.
