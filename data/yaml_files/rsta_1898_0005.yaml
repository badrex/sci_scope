revised_title: On the Application of Harmonic Analysis to the Dynamical Theory of
  Tides - Part II
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The author extends the method of solution for Laplace's dynamical equations
  for tides, removing the restriction of symmetrical solutions with respect to the
  axis of rotation. The paper focuses on the integration of these equations and the
  application of the resulting formulae to the discussion of free and forced vibrations
  in the ocean.
topics:
- Tides
- Harmonic Analysis
- Dynamical Equations
- Oceanography
- Tesseral Harmonics
