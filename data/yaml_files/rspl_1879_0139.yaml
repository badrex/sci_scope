revised_title: Thermal Effects of Electric Currents and Their Impact on Telecommunication
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the thermal effects of electric currents on thin wires
  and discovers that they can reproduce sound. Experiments show that certain wire
  materials and dimensions produce the clearest and loudest sounds. The findings suggest
  that the expansion and contraction of wires due to heating and cooling play a significant
  role in the reproduction of sound in telecommunication devices.
