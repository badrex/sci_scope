scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, details a method to render platinum malleable
  by controlling the dilution of aqua regia and precipitation with sal-ammoniac. The
  process involves purifying the platinum, reducing it to powder, and casting it into
  a mold. The resulting malleable platinum can be forged into various forms, demonstrating
  its tenacity and ductility.
