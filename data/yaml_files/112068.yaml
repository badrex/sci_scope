tldr: This paper investigates the physical constitution and relations of musical chords,
  exploring the role of harmonics and beat frequencies in the perception of pitch
  and dissonance. The author examines the effects of different beat numbers and intervals
  on the perception of musical chords and proposes a method for creating artificial
  qualities of tone through the combination of compound tones.
