tldr: The author investigates the relationship between electromagnetism and the conservation
  of physical force, discovering new and paradoxical phenomena. They develop a powerful
  generator of dynamic electricity and demonstrate that an electro-magnet can accumulate
  and retain a charge of electricity, leading to the evolution of large amounts of
  dynamic electricity.
