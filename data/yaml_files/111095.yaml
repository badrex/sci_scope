scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Nephrology & Neurology
tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, examines the variations of sulphates and phosphates
  in urine during various diseases. He finds that in acute chorea, the sulphates and
  urea in the urine are greatly increased, while in delirium tremens, the same state
  of urine is often observed when phosphates are not increased. In acute inflammation
  of the nervous structures, both sulphates and phosphates are increased in the urine.
  In chronic diseases, no significant increase in sulphates or phosphates is observed,
  except after taking sulphate of magnesia.
