scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author, Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, investigates the fine structure of nerve
  centers, specifically the connections and functions of neurons. He refutes previous
  theories about the existence of a neural network and provides evidence for the direct
  connections between fibers and nerve cells through contacts and articulations.
