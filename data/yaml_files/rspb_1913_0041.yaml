revised_title: The Excystation Process of Colpoda cucullus and Properties of Cyst
  Membranes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Protozoology & Microbiology
tldr: The author investigates the excystation process of Colpoda cucullus and the
  properties of its cyst membranes. They find that temperature and pH play a significant
  role in the excystation rate, and that the cyst membranes are insoluble in water,
  acids, and fat solvents, but can be dissolved by strong alkaline solutions.
