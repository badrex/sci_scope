revised_title: Investigating the Forms Assumed by Drops of Liquids Falling Vertically
  on a Horizontal Plate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Science
tldr: The author investigates the patterns formed by drops of various liquids falling
  vertically on a horizontal plate, using a novel experimental setup. They observe
  the forms through which the drops pass using an electric spark, providing insight
  into the complex movements of the liquid and the factors influencing the resulting
  patterns.
