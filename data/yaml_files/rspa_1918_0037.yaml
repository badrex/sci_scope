revised_title: Investigating the Absorption of X-Rays in Different Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of X-rays in various substances, focusing
  on the absorption of palladium's K-alpha line. They find that the atomic absorption
  coefficient is not directly proportional to the atomic number, but rather, elements
  group into categories where the coefficient is proportional to the atomic number.

- X-ray Absorption
- Atomic Absorption Coefficient
- X-ray Spectroscopy
- Crystallography
- X-ray Diffraction
