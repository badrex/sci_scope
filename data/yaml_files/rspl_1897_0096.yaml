tldr: Professor T.G. Bonney summarizes Professor Edgeworth David's preliminary report
  on the results of the boring in the Funafuti Atoll. The report discusses the materials
  and formations encountered during the boring process, including coral reef rock,
  sandy materials, and coral limestone. The findings suggest that true reef has been
  pierced at depths up to 600 feet and that coral has grown abundantly in the locality
  of Funafuti.
