revised_title: Tidal Friction and the Evolution of the Solar System
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of tidal friction on a planet with multiple
  satellites and applies the findings to the evolution of the solar system. The study
  concludes that tidal friction has had a minimal impact on the expansion of planetary
  orbits and that the distribution of satellites in the solar system is influenced
  by the distance from the sun.
