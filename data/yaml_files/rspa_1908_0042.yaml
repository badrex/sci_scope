revised_title: Investigating Secondary Rays and Their Dependence on Atomic Weight
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the intensity and direction of secondary rays emitted
  by substances exposed to radium rays, finding that the intensity depends on the
  atomic weight of the element and that a portion of the secondary rays follows the
  ordinary law of reflection.
topics:
- Secondary Radiation
- Atomic Weight
- Reflected Rays
- Radium Rays
- Ionization
