revised_title: Investigation of Polarization in Platinum Electrodes in Sulphuric Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: This study investigates the polarization of platinum electrodes in sulphuric
  acid and finds that the polarization remains constant with large electrodes, being
  independent of the strength of the solution and the intensity of the current.
