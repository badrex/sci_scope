revised_title: Deformation of Elastic Spheroidal Shells and Spheroids of Incompressible
  Liquid
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: 'This paper investigates the deformation of elastic spheroidal shells and spheroids
  of incompressible liquid under two conditions: when the displacement of each surface
  is given and when the force per unit area is given. The author applies these formulas
  to determine the deformation produced in the Earth by the tide-generating forces
  of the moon and sun, based on certain hypotheses about the Earth''s rigidity.'
