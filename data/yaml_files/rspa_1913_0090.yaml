revised_title: On the Refraction and Dispersion of Gaseous Nitrogen Peroxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refraction and dispersion of gaseous nitrogen peroxide,
  finding that its refractivity per molecule is greater than that of two molecules
  of nitrogen and oxygen combined. They also observe the additive law for refractivity
  in gaseous mixtures and discuss the dispersion of nitrogen peroxide.

- Nitrogen Peroxide
- Refraction
