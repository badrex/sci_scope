revised_title: Development of a Rigid Spectroscope for Terrestrial Gravity Observations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Instrumentation
tldr: The author describes the construction of a rigid spectroscope designed to determine
  if the position of spectral lines remains constant during changes in terrestrial
  gravity. The spectroscope was tested and found to be most effective in observing
  changes in temperature rather than in balloon ascents, as initially intended.
