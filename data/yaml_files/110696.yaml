scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author examines the electrochemical equivalents of sodium and potassium,
  and their atomic weights, through a series of experiments. He concludes that there
  is no reason to doubt the correctness of the received atomic weights of silver,
  sodium, etc., and that the difficulty lies with the di-compounds of copper.
