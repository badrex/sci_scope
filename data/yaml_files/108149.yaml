tldr: The author investigates the distribution of air-passages and the formation of
  air-cells in the lungs, providing evidence that bronchial tubes terminate in branched
  air-passages and freely communicating air-cells within lobules. The study also distinguishes
  between intralobular bronchial branches and lobular passages, and describes the
  process of air distribution within the lung.
