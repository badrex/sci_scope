revised_title: Investigating the Photo-Electric Discharge from Metallic Surfaces in
  Different Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the photo-electric discharge from metallic surfaces
  in various gases, focusing on the dependence of the photo-electric current on the
  pressure and nature of the gas. The experiments reveal that the current increases
  rapidly with the potential difference up to a certain value, after which the increase
  is more gradual until another critical value is reached, when a further increase
  in the potential causes a rapid increase in the current.
