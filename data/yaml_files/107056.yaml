revised_title: Investigation of the Heating and Illuminating Powers of Prismatic Colors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the heating and illuminating powers of different prismatic
  colors using thermometers and a prism. The experiments reveal that the heating power
  of the prismatic colors is not equally distributed, with red rays being the most
  prominent in heating objects.
