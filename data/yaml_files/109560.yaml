revised_title: Observations on the Quantity of Horizontal Refraction and a Method
  of Measuring the Dip at Sea
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the phenomenon of horizontal
  refraction and its impact on nautical observations. He proposes a method to measure
  the dip at sea by considering the temperature of the water and air, as well as the
  influence of land on the temperature of the air. This method helps correct errors
  in nautical observations caused by assuming a constant horizon height.
