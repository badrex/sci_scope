revised_title: The Rate of Chloroform Assumption by Blood During Anaesthesia
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anesthesiology & Pain Management
tldr: The authors investigate the rate at which chloroform is taken up by the blood
  during anaesthesia, finding that the rate of elimination may be greater than the
  rate of assumption. They also explore the effects of respiratory movements on the
  relative proportions of chloroform in the blood and the importance of maintaining
  a constant chloroform content in inspired air.
