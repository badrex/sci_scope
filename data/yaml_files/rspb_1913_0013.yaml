  Curve

scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Vascular Medicine
tldr: This study investigates the impact of arterial wall resilience on blood pressure
  and pulse curve. The authors demonstrate that the nature of the arterial wall affects
  the conduction of the systolic wave, and blood pressure, as measured by sphygmometer,
  depends on the effect of the arterial wall on the pressure wave produced by the
  heart. The study also shows that the resilience of the arterial wall influences
  the amplitude and form of the pressure waves, with higher resilience leading to
  smaller amplitudes and more continuous pressure.
