tldr: The authors conducted autopsies on 25 typical cases of cholera in Spain and
  found that Koch's comma bacillus was not present in all cases. They also discovered
  that the pathogenic effects of the bacillus in animals did not match the phenomena
  of cholera in humans. The authors suggest that further investigation is needed to
  determine the relationship between the comma bacillus and cholera.
