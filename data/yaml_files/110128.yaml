tldr: Sir Everard Home examines the formation of pearls and concludes that they are
  formed on the external surface of a blighted ovum, which remains attached to its
  pedicle in the ovarium. He also notes that the shape of pearls can be influenced
  by the position of the pedicle and ovum, which are coated in nacre.
