revised_title: On the Relative Densities of Hydrogen and Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: Lord Rayleigh investigates the relative densities of hydrogen and oxygen using
  eudiometric methods and finds that the ratio of atomic weights deviates from the
  simple ratio 1:16, suggesting a need for a reevaluation of atomic weights.
