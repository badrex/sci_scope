revised_title: A Novel Method for Tidal Observation Reduction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Sciences
tldr: The author presents a new method for reducing tidal observations using a computing
  apparatus with movable pieces. This method simplifies the process of determining
  the mean height of water at specific times, allowing for more accurate and efficient
  tidal analysis.
