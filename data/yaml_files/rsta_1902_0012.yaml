revised_title: The Stability of a Spherical Nebula
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: 'The author investigates the stability of a spherical nebula, examining the
  effects of gravitational forces, rotation, and thermal conductivity on the equilibrium
  of a gaseous mass. The study considers two cases: a nebula with a constant pressure
  applied to its outer surface and a nebula extending to infinity. The findings provide
  insight into the behavior of nebulae and contribute to our understanding of celestial
  mechanics and stellar evolution.'
