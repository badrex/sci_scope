tldr: The author examines water samples from the Mediterranean Sea to understand the
  distribution of salt in the region. By analyzing samples taken from various depths,
  the study reveals that a denser current at great depths carries salt westward into
  the Atlantic, balancing the salt brought in by the eastward surface current.
