revised_title: On the Theory of Compound Colours and the Relations of the Colours
  of the Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the colors of the spectrum
  and their representation in a triangle, proposing a new method for understanding
  color perception and the mixing of colors. The study uses experimental methods to
  determine the exact relations of the colors of the spectrum and lays down these
  relations on Newton's diagram.
