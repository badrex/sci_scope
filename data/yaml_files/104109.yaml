scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to prove the existence of a fluid
  in the nerves, also known as animal spirits. The experiments demonstrate that the
  brain and nerves contribute significantly to muscle movement and that this action
  cannot be attributed to elasticity. The author concludes that the action of nerves
  in muscle movement is due to the fluid they contain, which is separate from the
  elasticity of blood vessels.
