revised_title: Investigating the Constitution of Copper-Tin Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors study the constitution of copper-tin alloys by chilling them at
  selected temperatures and examining their structures under a microscope. They use
  this method to determine the phases and states of aggregation in the alloys, providing
  insights into their composition and properties.
