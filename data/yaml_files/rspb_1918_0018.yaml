  A Comprehensive Study'
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular System
tldr: This study investigates the mechanism and control of fibrillation in the mammalian
  heart, focusing on the changes in conduction and excitability of cardiac musculature.
  The research establishes that fibrillation involves a change in the manner of conduction,
  with excitation waves traveling along fasciculi rather than directly through the
  muscle. The study also highlights the role of depression of conductivity and excessive
  rapidity of excitation in inducing fibrillation and the gradation from discrete
  fibrillar beats to rapid and mechanically ineffective oscillations of typical fibrillation.
