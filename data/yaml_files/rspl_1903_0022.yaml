revised_title: The Bionomics and Development of Convoluta Roscoffensis and its Green
  Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The authors study the bionomics and development of Convoluta Roscoffensis, a
  green Turbellarian found along the coast of Brittany. They investigate its feeding
  habits, the development of its green cells, and its response to various environmental
  stimuli such as light, gravity, and temperature. They conclude that the green cells
  are likely facultative parasites and that the relationship between the animal and
  the algae is not symbiotic.
