revised_title: Investigating the Rotatory Motion of Glass Tubes Near a Fire
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author examines the rotatory motion of glass tubes near a fire and concludes
  that it is not due to air drafts or molecular attraction and repulsion. Instead,
  the phenomenon is likely caused by thermal expansion of the glass tubes.
