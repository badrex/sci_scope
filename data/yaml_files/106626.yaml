revised_title: Experiments on Heat Conductivity in a Torricellian Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the heat conductivity of a Torricellian
  vacuum and finds that it is a worse conductor of heat than common air. The results
  suggest that the vacuum does not readily transfer heat, which has implications for
  understanding heat transfer and insulation.
