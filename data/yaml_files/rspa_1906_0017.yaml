revised_title: 'On the Simple Group of Order 25920: A Projective Geometry Approach'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Group Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates the simple group of order 25920 using a projective geometry
  approach, establishing the existence of a remarkable configuration of points, lines,
  and planes. The study focuses on Abelian groups of collineations of order 2 and
  their properties, leading to the discovery of a group with order not exceeding 16.
