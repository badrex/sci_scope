tldr: The author investigates the properties and optical characteristics of cinchona
  alkaloids, specifically quinidin and quinine, and discovers new salts and crystal
  forms with unique optical properties. The research also explores the purification
  and analysis of these alkaloids, as well as the molecular rotation of cinchona alkaloids
  to determine their purity.
