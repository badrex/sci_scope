revised_title: Investigation of the Electric Conducting Power of Copper and Its Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: A. Matthiessen investigates the electric conducting power of copper and its
  alloys, finding that pure copper conducts better than any of the alloys. The differences
  in conducting power are attributed to the presence of impurities and the absorption
  of suboxide during the fusion process.
