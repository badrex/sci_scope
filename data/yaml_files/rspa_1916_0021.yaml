revised_title: The Microstructure of Semipermeable Membranes and the Role of Surface
  Forces in Osmosis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the microscopic structure of semipermeable membranes
  and discovers that they consist of small particles of slightly different sizes,
  aggregated together and influenced by surface forces. The size of these particles
  and the structure of the membranes vary depending on the method of formation and
  the solutions they are exposed to.
