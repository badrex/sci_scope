revised_title: On the Parallax of Double Stars and the Method for Measuring Their
  Annual Parallax
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Astrometry
tldr: The author discusses the challenges and limitations of measuring the parallax
  of fixed stars using zenith distances and proposes a new method for observing double
  stars to determine their annual parallax. The author also addresses the influence
  of various factors, such as refraction, nutation, precession, and aberration, on
  the accuracy of these measurements.
