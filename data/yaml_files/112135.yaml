tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the effects of administering
  proglottides of Tenia mediocanellata to a calf. They observed symptoms of acute
  cestode tuberculosis, including nervous irritability, loss of appetite, and muscle
  tremors. Post-mortem examination revealed cysticercus vesicles in the calf's muscles,
  confirming the presence of the parasite.
