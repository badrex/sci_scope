revised_title: The Relationship between Elastic Force of Aqueous Vapour and Motive
  Force in Producing Air Currents in Vertical Tubes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the elastic force of aqueous
  vapor and its motive force in producing air currents in vertical tubes. The study
  demonstrates that the velocity of the ascending current in the tube varies inversely
  as the density or elastic force of the vapor suspended in the atmosphere.
