revised_title: Magnetic Action of Variations in Electric Displacement
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author describes a new device that can explore varying electrostatic fields
  and potentially investigate specific inductive capacities. The device uses an iron
  annulus surrounded by a copper wire coil, which sets up induction currents in response
  to magnetic forces caused by electric displacement variations. This discovery could
  have various applications in the study of electromagnetic phenomena.
