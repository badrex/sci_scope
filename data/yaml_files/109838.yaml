revised_title: 'Experiments with a Large Voltaic Battery: Ignition of Metals and Fusion
  of Oxides'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes
tldr: J.G. Children conducted experiments with a large voltaic battery, comparing
  the ignition of various metals and the fusion of oxides. The battery was composed
  of 21 cells with zinc, copper, and acid solutions. The author observed that platinum
  and iron were the most easily ignited metals, followed by gold, copper, zinc, and
  silver. Oxides of tungsten, tantalum, molybdenum, and iridium were fused, while
  ruby, sapphire, and quartz remained unaffected. The experiment also attempted to
  convert iron into steel using diamond powder, resulting in a hardened steel-like
  material.
