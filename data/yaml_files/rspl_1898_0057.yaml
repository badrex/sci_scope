scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Gas Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the properties of argon and separate two new gases,
  neon and metargon, through a series of experiments involving liquid air and gas
  fractionation. Neon has a lower density and distinct spectral properties compared
  to argon, while metargon has a complex spectrum and behaves differently at low temperatures.
  These discoveries expand the understanding of the periodic table and the properties
  of elemental gases.
