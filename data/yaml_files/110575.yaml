revised_title: 'On the Colours of Mixed Plates: A Study of Diffraction Phenomena'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Sir David Brewster investigates the colors produced by mixed plates, using a
  thin film of egg white between glass plates. He concludes that these phenomena are
  cases of diffraction, where light is obstructed by the edges of thin transparent
  plates in a medium of different refractive power, resulting in fringes within the
  shadow of the plate.
