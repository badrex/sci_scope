revised_title: Explaining Earthquakes through Electrical Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Studies
tldr: The author, William Stukely, proposes that earthquakes are caused by electrical
  shocks similar to those in electrical experiments. He suggests that the unusual
  dryness and warmth of the winter season, along with the presence of the Northern
  Lights, indicate that the Earth was in a highly electrified state, making it more
  susceptible to earthquakes.
