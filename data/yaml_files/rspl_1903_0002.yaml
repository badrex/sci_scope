revised_title: The Influence of Light on the Combination of Hydrogen and Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of light on the combination of hydrogen and
  chlorine, discovering that the initial expansion observed when light falls on a
  hydrogen-chlorine mixture is due to a rise in temperature caused by the formation
  of hydrochloric acid. They also find that the presence of water vapor significantly
  speeds up the reaction and that preliminary illumination of chlorine alone increases
  the readiness of the mixture to combine.
