  and the Diurnal Inequality'

tldr: The author investigates the tides of the Pacific Ocean and the diurnal inequality,
  analyzing extensive tide observations and discussing the limitations of drawing
  cotidal lines across wide oceans. The study reveals that tides in the mid-ocean
  are generally small, and suggests that a stationary undulation may be a more accurate
  representation of oceanic tides.
