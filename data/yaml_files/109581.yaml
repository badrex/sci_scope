revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Heat and its Modes of Communication
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author, Benjamin Count of Rumford, investigates the nature of heat and its
  modes of communication through a series of experiments. He discovers that clothing
  can sometimes expedite the passage of heat out of a hot body, and that the rate
  of cooling of hot bodies can be used to interpolate missing data points in experiments.
  He also develops a thermoscope to measure small changes in temperature caused by
  radiation from neighboring bodies.
