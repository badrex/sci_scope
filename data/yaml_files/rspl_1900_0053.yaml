revised_title: Spectrum Analysis of Volatile Atmospheric Gases and Their Residue at
  Liquid Hydrogen Temperature
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of volatile gases in the atmosphere that
  are not condensed at liquid hydrogen temperatures. They discover that these gases
  contain hydrogen, helium, and neon, and suggest that there may be a continuous accession
  of these gases from interplanetary space into the Earth's atmosphere.
