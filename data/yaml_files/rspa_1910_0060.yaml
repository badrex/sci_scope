revised_title: 'On the Absorption of Gases by Charcoal: Isothermals and Isochores'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of various gases by charcoal at different
  temperatures and pressures, and present isothermal and isochoric data for gases
  such as helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, dioxide, and
  oxygen. They also discuss the utility of these data in understanding gas absorption
  phenomena and the separation of mixed gases using selective absorption in charcoal.
topics:
- Gas Absorption
- Charcoal
- Isothermals
- Isochores
- Gas Mixtures
