revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Dielectric Constants of Frozen Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors develop a cone-condenser design for measuring the dielectric constants
  of frozen electrolytes at and above the temperature of liquid air. They describe
  their experimental setup and methodology, and present their findings on the dielectric
  constants of various frozen electrolytes.
topics:
- Dielectric Constants
- Electrolytes
- Low Temperatures
- Condenser Design
