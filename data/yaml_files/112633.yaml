revised_title: Investigation of the Reaction between Hydric Peroxide and Hydric Iodide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Equations
tldr: The authors investigate the reaction between hydric peroxide and hydric iodide,
  finding that the amount of chemical change is directly proportional to the amount
  of peroxide and iodide present in the solution. They also discover that the rate
  of chemical change is directly proportional to the amount of iodide in the solution.
