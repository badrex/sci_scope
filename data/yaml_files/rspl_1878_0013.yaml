revised_title: On the Relative Facility of Production of Chemical Combinations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Bonding
tldr: The author investigates the relative facility of production of chemical combinations
  and explores the concept of units of matter and space in chemical reactions. He
  demonstrates that the facility of production varies depending on the number of operations
  and the order in which they are performed.
