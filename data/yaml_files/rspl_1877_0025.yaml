revised_title: On the Formation of Figures Exhibiting the Motion of Vibrating Bodies
  and a New Method for Determining the Speed of Machines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the formation of figures created by the motion of vibrating
  bodies and propose a new method for determining the speed of machines using rotating
  disks or cylinders. They describe various wave forms and their properties, as well
  as the use of convergent lines for dividing circles to measure speed accurately.
topics:
- Vibrations
- Wave Formation
- Optical Illusions
- Motion Analysis
- Speed Measurement
