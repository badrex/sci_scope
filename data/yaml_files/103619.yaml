  to Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to determine the proportion of the expansion
  of the liquid in a thermometer with respect to the degrees of heat. The results
  show that the expansion of the oil in the thermometer is proportional to the increase
  in heat.
