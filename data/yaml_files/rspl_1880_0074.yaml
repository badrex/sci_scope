revised_title: Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid Films and Newton's Table of Colours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical resistance of thin liquid films and revise
  Newton's table of colours. They find that the specific resistance of soap films
  thicker than 3.74 x 10^-5 centimeters is independent of the film's thickness and
  is equal to the liquid from which it is formed. They also discover that soap films
  can lose a significant amount of water if proper precautions are not taken during
  experiments.
