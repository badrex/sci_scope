scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the estrous cycle in the bitch, focusing on the role
  of ovarian secretion in the prooestrum and oestrus. The authors describe the four
  periods of the cycle, including anoestrum, prooestrum, oestrus, and metoestrum,
  and provide evidence supporting the idea that ovarian secretion is responsible for
  these periods.
