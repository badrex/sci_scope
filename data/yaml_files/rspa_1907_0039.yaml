revised_title: A Study of Projectile Motion and Resistance in Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the resistance of air, projectile
  motion, and the distance traveled by a projectile. Using mathematical equations
  and experiments, the author demonstrates that the formula derived from the data
  can accurately predict the range of various projectiles, from a 12-inch to a 0.303-inch
  projectile.
