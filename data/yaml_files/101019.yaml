tldr: The author describes the process of making sea-salt using solar energy in France.
  The salt is produced by allowing sea-water to evaporate in shallow marshes, where
  the sun's heat plays a crucial role in the process. The author also discusses factors
  that affect the quality and quantity of the salt produced, such as the type of soil,
  weather conditions, and the skill of the salt-makers.
