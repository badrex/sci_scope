tldr: This paper presents magnetic observations from various locations, focusing on
  discrepancies in results obtained by previous observers. The author investigates
  the causes of these discrepancies, concluding that "station error" due to local
  disturbing influences is the most likely explanation. The paper suggests combining
  fixed observatories and magnetic surveys to obtain accurate and reliable data for
  the general theory of terrestrial magnetism.
