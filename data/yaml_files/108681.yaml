tldr: The author investigates the anatomy and physiology of Brachiopoda, focusing
  on the vascular and alimentary systems. The study reveals differences in opinion
  among naturalists regarding the structure and function of the so-called hearts and
  the existence of an anal aperture in the pallial chamber. The author presents detailed
  findings on the anatomy of various Brachiopoda species, including Waldheimia, Terebratulina,
  Rhynchonella, and Lingula.
