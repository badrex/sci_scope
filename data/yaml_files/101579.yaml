revised_title: Observation and Explanation of Halo Phenomenon and Parelia
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author describes an observation of a halo around the sun and provides a
  detailed explanation of its formation. He suggests that halos are formed by small,
  icy grains with an opaque core, which cause the refraction of sunlight and create
  the circular shape. The author also explains the formation of parelia, or mock suns,
  through the presence of elongated icy grains in the atmosphere.
