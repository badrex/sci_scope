revised_title: Investigation of Optical Properties of Glass and Sulphur
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author examines the optical properties of glass and sulphur, focusing on
  the effects of polishing on the refractive index and transmission coefficients.
  The study reveals that the polishing process alters the surface of flint glass,
  decreasing the amount of reflected light and increasing the amount of transmitted
  light, while crown glass experiences minimal changes.
