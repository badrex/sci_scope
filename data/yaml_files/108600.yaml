revised_title: A New Method for Solving the Three-Body Problem in Celestial Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author presents a new method for solving the three-body problem in celestial
  mechanics, which involves determining the motion of two bodies affected by the gravitational
  pull of a third, stationary body. The method uses analysis to develop expressions
  for the radius-vector, longitude, latitude, and inequalities, and is applicable
  to both lunar and planetary motions.
