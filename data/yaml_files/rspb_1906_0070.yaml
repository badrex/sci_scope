revised_title: The Coferment's Role in Yeast Juice Fermentation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the role of coferment in yeast juice fermentation and
  find that it plays a crucial role in the process. They also observe that the coferment
  disappears from yeast juice during fermentation and autolysis, and the rate of disappearance
  varies depending on the presence of added glucose.
