scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, S.A. Drach, investigates the diurnal temperature of the Earth's
  surface and proposes a simple formula to determine it. He also discusses the effects
  of various factors, such as oceanic evaporation, mountain ranges, and local influences
  on temperature. Additionally, he explores the relationship between temperature,
  isothermal lines, and the electrical and magnetic conditions of the Earth due to
  its rotation on its axis.
