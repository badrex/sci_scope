  the Production of Electricity

tldr: Faraday investigates the relationship between chemical reactions and the production
  of electricity using various metal-sulfur combinations in electrolytes. He discovers
  that the formation of a conducting sulfuret halts the chemical action, which in
  turn ceases the electric current. This finding supports the idea that the current
  is dependent on the chemical force present in the system.
