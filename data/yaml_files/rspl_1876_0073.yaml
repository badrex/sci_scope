  Patterns
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The author investigates the early stages of liquid drop impact and the formation
  of patterns on various surfaces. They observe the formation of rays, arms, and other
  structures in drops of different liquids, such as mercury, milk, and water, and
  analyze the factors affecting the number and shape of these structures.
topics:
- Droplet Impact
- Surface Tension
- Fluid Dynamics
- Pattern Formation
- Liquids
