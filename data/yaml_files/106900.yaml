scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author examines the mechanisms behind vision and distance perception, questioning
  the role of the pupil's contraction and dilation in focusing on objects at different
  distances. They propose that the external eye muscles may play a more significant
  role in adapting to varying distances, as opposed to the iris and lens changes.
