revised_title: The Atomic Constitution of Titanium Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the atomic constitution of titanium compounds by comparing
  the boiling points of chlorine and bromine compounds. The study reveals that the
  bromide of titanium has a boiling point of 230Â°C, supporting the analogy between
  silicium and titanium and suggesting a new formula for titanium compounds.
