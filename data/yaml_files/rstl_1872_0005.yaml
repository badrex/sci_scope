  Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author corrects and expands upon a previous memoir on the theory of reciprocal
  surfaces, discussing the off-points and off-planes, nodal curves, cuspidal curves,
  and the equations involving these concepts. The paper also addresses inconsistencies
  and errors in the original memoir and provides new equations and interpretations
  for the theory.
