revised_title: Dynamical Explanation of Magnetic and Helicoidal Rotatory Effects on
  Polarized Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetization on polarized light and
  explains the phenomenon using a dynamical approach. The study demonstrates the reality
  of Ampere's explanation of magnetism and provides a definition of magnetization
  in the dynamical theory of heat.
