revised_title: Optical Phenomena of Borax Crystals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: Henry Fox Talbot investigates the optical properties of borax crystals using
  a polarizing microscope, discovering that they exhibit a well-defined dark cross
  and colored concentric rings. The author also observes a new species of dichroism
  in crystals, which supports the views of Sir David Brewster and others on the cause
  of dichroism in crystals.
