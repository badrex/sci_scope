revised_title: The Effects of Temperature on Torsional Rigidity of Metal Wires
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature on the modulus of torsional
  rigidity of metal wires, finding that the decrease of rigidity with a degree rise
  in temperature increases at first rapidly, but more slowly afterwards, with the
  rate being practically constant above 19 degrees Celsius.

- Thermal Expansion
- Torsional Rigidity
- Metals
- Temperature Coefficients
