revised_title: On the Behavior of Argon and Helium Under Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of argon and helium gases when exposed
  to electric discharge. They find that the distance a spark can travel in helium
  is significantly greater than in other gases, and they observe a ribbon-like discharge
  in various gases at specific pressures.
