  Emphasis on Desmid-Plankton and the Distribution of British Desmids

tldr: This study investigates the British freshwater phytoplankton, with a focus on
  desmid-plankton and the distribution of British desmids. The authors collected plankton
  samples from various lakes and rivers across the British Isles and found that the
  western and north-western lake-areas, which contain the majority of British lakes,
  have the most diverse and abundant phytoplankton species. The study also highlights
  the challenges faced in conducting quantitative investigations and understanding
  the periodicity of the plankton in these areas.
