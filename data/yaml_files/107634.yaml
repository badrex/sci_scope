revised_title: Investigating Changes in the Declination of Principal Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author examines the changes in the declination of principal fixed stars
  using the Greenwich Catalogue and the mural circle. He discovers a general tendency
  for stars to appear south of their predicted places, with some stars exhibiting
  accelerated proper motion. The author concludes that further observations are needed
  to accurately determine the underlying law governing these changes.
