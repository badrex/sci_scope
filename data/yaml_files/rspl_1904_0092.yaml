revised_title: 'Harmonic Undertones and Vibrations: A Study on Tuning Forks and Light
  Objects'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: The authors investigate the phenomenon of harmonic undertones produced when
  a vibrating tuning fork strikes a light object like a piece of paper or a stretched
  string. They describe how the irregular contact between the fork and the object
  results in a complex vibration, producing a sound with significant harmonic overtones,
  similar to a bowed violin string. The paper also explores the behavior of a light
  object under periodic blows and the effect of varying the pressure and point of
  contact.
