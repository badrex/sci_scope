scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology & Digestive System
tldr: The author investigates the effects of motor insufficiency on the healing of
  gastric ulcers in cats using a gastrotoxin produced by injecting stomach cells from
  one animal into another. The study shows that when the stomach is empty, ulceration
  may not occur or only be superficial, while the presence of food or acid fluid in
  the stomach can lead to more severe ulceration.
