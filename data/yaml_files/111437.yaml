tldr: This article explores the partitions of r-pyramids, specifically focusing on
  the first class of r-gonous x-edra. The author provides formulas to determine the
  number of partitions in terms of r-gon and r-ace partitions, but states that further
  classification of polyedra would introduce too much complexity for practical scientific
  generality.
