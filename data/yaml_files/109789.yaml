revised_title: On the Attraction of Flames and Fumes in Electro-Chemical Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Experiments
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of flames and fumes in electro-chemical
  phenomena, observing that the direction of attraction depends on the nature of the
  substance. He concludes that these experiments provide further evidence of the identity
  of common and voltaic electricity and the inherent electrical states of different
  species of matter.
