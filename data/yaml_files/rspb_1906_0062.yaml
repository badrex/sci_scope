tldr: This study investigates the process of nerve regeneration and the role of neurilemmal
  cells in the repair of divided nerves. The authors conclude that the axis cylinder,
  the essential part of a nerve fiber, has an exclusively central origin, and that
  the activity of neurilemmal cells is related to the development of new nerve fibers.
