revised_title: Experiments on the Production of Cold by the Evaporation of Sulphuret
  of Carbon

scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Alexander Marcet investigates the production of cold through the evaporation
  of sulphuret of carbon. He finds that using a thermometer coated with the substance
  and placed in a vacuum can produce temperatures as low as -81Â°F. This method allows
  for easy freezing of mercury and can be performed with minimal equipment.
