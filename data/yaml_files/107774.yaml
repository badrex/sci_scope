scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology & Digestive System
tldr: The author investigates the role of the nervous system and gastric juice in
  digestion, concluding that while the nervous system is necessary for the secretion
  of gastric juice, the muscular power of the stomach can still carry on digestion
  without it. The author also discusses the use of a voltaic pile to imitate the effect
  of the nervous system on gastric juice production.
