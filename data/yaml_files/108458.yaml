revised_title: The Influence of Tartrate of Ammonia and Carbonate of Ammonia on Urine
  Acidity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Health
tldr: Henry Bence Jones investigates the effects of tartrate of ammonia and carbonate
  of ammonia on urine acidity. He finds that tartrate of ammonia has no significant
  impact on urine acidity, while carbonate of ammonia slightly reduces it. The study
  highlights the differences between the actions of volatile and fixed alkalis on
  urine acidity.
