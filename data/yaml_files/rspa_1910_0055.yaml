scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrostatistics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the probability of a random distribution of stars in
  space using statistical methods and parallax constants. They analyze various theoretical
  distributions and discuss the implications of spheroidal and non-uniform stellar
  systems, comparing their findings with actual data from observed stars.
