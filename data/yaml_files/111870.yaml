revised_title: The Influence of Alkalies on Hepatine Transformation in the Liver
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the effects of alkalies, specifically the carbonate
  of soda, on the transformation of hepatine in the liver. They find that introducing
  carbonate of soda into the portal system during life can cause a rapid transformation
  of hepatine, preventing the production of sugar in the urine. This discovery has
  significant implications for understanding the physiological history of hepatine
  and its role in the body.
