revised_title: On the Mathematical Theory of Quadrifocal Stream-Lines
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Naval Architecture & Ship Design
tldr: The author investigates the mathematical properties of stream-lines, specifically
  quadrifocal or cycnoidal shapes, which resemble the water-lines of bird-like models.
  These shapes have endless varieties and can be used in ship design to reduce resistance
  and improve efficiency.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Stream-Lines
- Cycnoidal Shapes
- Naval Architecture
- Ship Design
