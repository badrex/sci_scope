revised_title: Interference Phenomena in Electric Waves Passing through Different
  Thicknesses of Electrolyte
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates interference phenomena in electric waves passing through
  different thicknesses of electrolytes, discovering that the intensity of the transmitted
  ray does not steadily decrease, and that transmission follows the same general law
  as for light with a thin plate. The wave-lengths in air and water are determined,
  leading to the calculation of the coefficient of refraction and the dielectric constant.
