revised_title: Determination of a Degree of a Great Circle in English Measures
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Surveying
tldr: The author presents a method used by English mathematician Richard Norwood to
  measure the distance between York and London, and subsequently calculates the length
  of a degree of a great circle on Earth. This method involves measuring the angles
  of position and windings of the route, and using a table to determine the distance.
  The result is a degree measurement of 367,200 feet, which is close to the French
  measurement at the time.
