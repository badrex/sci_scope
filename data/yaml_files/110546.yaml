  and Relations between Roots'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This memoir by Rev. R. Murphy investigates the constituent parts of the roots
  of algebraic equations and their relations. It demonstrates how to determine the
  constituent parts by considering the conditions under which they vanish and how
  to interpret these parts in the context of various equations of different degrees.
topics:
- Algebraic Equations
- Roots of Equations
- Constituent Parts of Roots
- Roots of Unity
- Evanescence of Constituent Parts
