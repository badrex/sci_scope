  Numbers and Preliminary Findings'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the transport numbers of various substances dissolved
  in liquefied hydrogen bromide, including ethyl ether, acetone, methyl hexyl ketone,
  and triethylammonium bromide. They find that the cation transport number increases
  with concentration, and that substances like ether and acetone function as part
  of the cation or as a component of it.
