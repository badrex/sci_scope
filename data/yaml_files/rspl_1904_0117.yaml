revised_title: 'On the Convergence of Infinite Series of Analytic Functions: Approximations
  and Limitations'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The authors explore the convergence of infinite series of analytic functions
  and develop methods to approximate and find conditions for convergence. They demonstrate
  the limitations of the method and provide two theorems to help remove these limitations
  in specific cases, such as expansions in hypergeometric functions.
