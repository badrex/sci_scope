revised_title: A Study of Functional Invariants in Mathematics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates functional invariants, specifically focusing on their
  properties and applications in the context of homographic transformations and partial
  differential equations. The study covers invariants involving differential coefficients
  of a function of two independent variables and provides insights into their classification,
  forms, and relations to other mathematical concepts.
