tldr: The author reports an observation made in China that establishes a connection
  between terrestrial magnetism and meteorology. A simultaneous perturbation of the
  barometer and the magnetic needle was observed, with the barometer reaching a maximum
  at the same time as two westerly maxima of declination. This event occurred after
  the previous evening's aurora and was followed by a N.E. wind and rain.
