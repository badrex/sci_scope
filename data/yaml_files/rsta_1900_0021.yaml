scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Discrete Mathematics
tldr: The author presents a new method in combinatorial analysis, which involves designing
  an operation and a function to enumerate combinations and solve problems such as
  the Latin Square problem. The method also provides a graphical representation of
  the combinations and can be applied to various questions in mathematics.
