tldr: The author presents a study of diurnal inequalities in terrestrial magnetism
  using data collected at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. The
  study focuses on the declination, horizontal force, and vertical force of magnets,
  and the results provide valuable insights into the state of terrestrial magnetism
  during this period.
