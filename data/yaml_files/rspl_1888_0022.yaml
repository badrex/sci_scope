revised_title: Magnetic Properties of Nickel and their Relation to Stress
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: This study investigates the magnetic qualities of nickel, focusing on its magnetization
  curve, magnetic susceptibility, and the effect of stress on its magnetic properties.
  The results show that stress, particularly longitudinal pull, significantly reduces
  nickel's magnetism, with less hysteresis compared to iron.
