revised_title: Decomposition of Sulphuric Acid by Pentachloride of Phosphorus
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Acid-Base Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of sulphuric acid by pentachloride
  of phosphorus and discovers the formation of chloro-hydrated sulphuric acid, which
  is intermediate between the hydrated acid and the final product. This finding supports
  the notion that the bibasic character of sulphuric acid is due to one atom of its
  radical replacing two atoms of hydrogen.
