revised_title: Crystal Structure Analysis through X-ray Diffraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Physics of Materials & Condensed Matter
tldr: The authors develop a method to investigate crystal structures using X-ray diffraction,
  proposing that the direction of diffracted waves is related to the crystal's space
  lattice and Miller indices. They apply this method to several alkaline halide crystals,
  providing insights into their structures.

- X-ray Crystallography
