revised_title: On the Alteration of Thermal Conductivity of Iron and Steel due to
  Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the alteration of thermal conductivity in iron and steel
  caused by magnetism. Using various experimental setups and thermometers, the study
  reveals that the conductivity of iron is affected by magnetization, with the flow
  of heat being reduced in the presence of a magnetic field.
