revised_title: A Simple Experiment to Demonstrate the Different Refrangibility of
  Light Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a straightforward experiment to confirm Sir Isaac Newton's
  theory of different refrangibility of light rays using a candle, a prism, and a
  mirror. The experiment demonstrates that different colors of light have varying
  refractive properties, supporting Newton's doctrine.
