revised_title: 'Transformation of Aniline into Benzoic Acid: A Study by A. W. Hofmann'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the transformation of aniline into benzoic acid through
  a series of experiments. He discovers that heating aniline causes it to decompose,
  forming benzonitrile and other substances. This process may potentially be used
  to produce higher terms of the series of aromatic acids.
