revised_title: Determination of the Length of a Pendulum Vibrating Seconds in the
  Latitude of London

scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Measurement
tldr: Captain Henry Kater investigates the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds
  in the latitude of London using a unique suspension method and precise measurements.
  He determines the distance between the knife-edges of the pendulum, accounting for
  temperature and barometric factors, and concludes that the length of the seconds'
  pendulum in vacuo is very near the truth.
