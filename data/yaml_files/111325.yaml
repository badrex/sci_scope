revised_title: 'Involuntary Muscular Fibre Research: A Comparative Analysis of Voluntary
  and Involuntary Muscles'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, George Viner Ellis, investigates the structure of involuntary muscular
  fibers and compares them to voluntary muscles. He finds that both types of muscles
  have similar fiber arrangements and compositions, challenging the prevailing views
  on their differences. Ellis concludes that involuntary and voluntary muscles share
  many similarities, such as fiber interweaving, size variations, and fibril composition.
