revised_title: On the Steady Motion and Small Vibrations of a Hollow Vortex
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the steady motion and small vibrations of a hollow vortex,
  introducing new functions to describe the streamlines and analyzing the energy,
  velocity, and form of the vortex. They also explore the differences between solid
  and hollow vortices and the effects of cyclic motion and translation on the vortex's
  behavior.
topics:
- Vortex Motion
- Toroidal Functions
- Fluid Dynamics
- Hollow Vortex
- Vortex Ring
