revised_title: A Simplified Approach to Abel's Theorem
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a simplified and more accessible version of Abel's theorem,
  a general property of a wide class of transcendental functions, by rearranging parts,
  separating essential steps, and introducing a new symbol and theorem. This approach
  retains the theorem's generality while making it easier to understand.
