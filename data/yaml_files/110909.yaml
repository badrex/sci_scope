revised_title: The Accuracy and Limitations of Barometric Thermometers in Determining
  Relative Heights
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: James R. Christie investigates the use of barometric thermometers for determining
  relative heights and finds that they can provide accurate results, but with some
  uncertainty. He compares his findings with other methods and concludes that the
  barometric thermometer is a valuable tool, but its accuracy may be affected by rapid
  changes in atmospheric pressure.
