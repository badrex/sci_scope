revised_title: Experimental Evidence on the Mechanical Transmission of Sleeping Sickness
  by the Tsetse Fly
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments to investigate the mechanical transmission
  of sleeping sickness by the tsetse fly. They find that interrupted feeding, where
  the fly transfers between infected and healthy animals quickly, results in successful
  transmission, while delayed feeding does not. This suggests that mechanical transmission
  plays a smaller role in the spread of sleeping sickness than previously thought.
