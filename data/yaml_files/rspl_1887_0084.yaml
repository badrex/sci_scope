revised_title: Investigating the Electrodeposition of Alloys and Electromotive Forces
  in Cyanide Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the electrodeposition of alloys and the electromotive
  forces of metals in cyanide solutions. They find that the effect of higher concentration
  in cyanide solutions increases the electromotive force of copper more than zinc,
  and that the neutral point varies with the concentration of the solution and temperature.
  This research helps explain the departure from Berzelius' law in electrodeposition
  processes.
