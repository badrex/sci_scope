revised_title: Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Declination at St. Helena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine's study of magnetic declination at St. Helena reveals
  that diurnal variations still occur at intermediate stations between the northern
  and southern magnetic hemispheres. These variations follow the position of the sun
  relative to the Earth's equator, with distinct patterns for each hemisphere.
