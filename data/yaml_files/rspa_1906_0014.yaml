revised_title: Further Experiments on the Chemical Behaviour of Argon and Helium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on the chemical behavior of argon and helium
  at high temperatures, investigating their potential to combine with other elements.
  They find that the gases remain chemically inert, with no evidence of chemical combination,
  even when exposed to elevated temperatures.
topics:
- Inert Gases
- Chemical Combination
- Vapor Densities
- High Temperature Chemistry
- Gas Phase Chemistry
