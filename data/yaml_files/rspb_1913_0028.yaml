scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neuroanatomy
tldr: The author discovers a previously unknown ganglion in the human temporal bone,
  which they name the 'Stapedial Ganglion.' The ganglion is associated with a plexus
  of nerves and is embedded in bone. Its structure and potential physiological significance
  are discussed, though further research is needed to fully understand its role in
  human anatomy.
