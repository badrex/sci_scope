revised_title: A Comparative Study of Platinum and Gas Thermometers with a Determination
  of the Boiling Point of Sulphur on the Nitrogen Scale
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study compares the accuracy and reliability of platinum and gas thermometers,
  focusing on the determination of the boiling point of sulfur on the nitrogen scale.
  The authors describe their experimental methods and findings, ultimately establishing
  a temperature scale for platinum and evaluating its correlation with the gas thermometer.
