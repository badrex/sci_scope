revised_title: The Nature of Enzymes and the Hydrolysis of Cane Sugar
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the nature of enzymes and their specificity, focusing
  on the action of maltase and emulsin. They also study the hydrolysis of cane sugar
  and the inhibiting effects of glucose and fructose on invertase, concluding that
  enzymes are intimately correlated with their substrates.
topics:
- Enzyme action
- Enzyme inhibition
- Cane sugar hydrolysis
- Enzyme specificity
- Enzyme structure
