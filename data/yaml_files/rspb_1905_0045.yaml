revised_title: The Role of Special Substances in Phagocytosis of Red Blood-Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: The author investigates the factors that determine phagocytosis in vitro of
  red blood-cells and discovers that the presence of amboceptor and agglutinin is
  not necessary for phagocytosis to occur. A special substance in the serum, which
  can be withdrawn by red blood-cells, is responsible for this process.
