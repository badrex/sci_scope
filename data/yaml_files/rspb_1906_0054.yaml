scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Cell Biology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of anaesthetics on the frog's skin, specifically
  focusing on the action of chloroform. The results show that chloroform applied to
  the outer surface of the skin abolishes the current, while it has no significant
  effect on the inner surface.

- Frog's skin
- Anaesthetics
