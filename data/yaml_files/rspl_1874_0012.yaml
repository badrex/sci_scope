revised_title: On the Coefficient of Expansion of a Paraffine of High Boiling Point
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the coefficient of expansion of a paraffin with a high
  boiling point and discovers that it has an unusually high expansion rate when heated.
  The study also highlights the challenges in accurately measuring the expansion due
  to the paraffin's low conductivity and the release of flammable vapors.
