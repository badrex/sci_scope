scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biotechnology
tldr: Barnard and Hewlett present a new method for disintegrating bacterial and organic
  cells using a mechanical apparatus with steel balls and a cone. The method is efficient,
  minimizes friction, and allows for cooling, making it a potential tool for further
  research and analysis of microorganisms.
