revised_title: Experimental Verification of Thomson's Formula for Thermal Effects
  of Compressing Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule's experiments demonstrate the correctness of Professor Thomson's formula
  for the thermal effects of compressing fluids, showing that the mechanical equivalent
  of heat is conserved in water and oil.
