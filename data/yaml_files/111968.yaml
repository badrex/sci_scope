  and Frogs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Development
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the effects of temperature and
  light on the development of tadpoles and frogs. The results show that temperature
  plays a significant role in development, while light can either have no effect or
  hinder the process depending on the conditions. The study also highlights the importance
  of atmospheric respiration during metamorphosis.
