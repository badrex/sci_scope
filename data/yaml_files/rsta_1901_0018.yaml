revised_title: 'Thermal Emissivity in High-Pressure Gases: A Study on Platinum Surface
  at High Temperatures'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the heat dissipated by a platinum surface at high temperatures
  in high-pressure gases. They develop a method to measure thermal emissivity and
  find that the rate of heat dissipation is affected by pressure, with only a small
  proportion being due to conductivity at higher pressures.

- Thermal Emissivity
- High-Pressure Gases
- Platinum Surface
