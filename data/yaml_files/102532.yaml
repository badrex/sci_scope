tldr: Dr. Rob. Conny recounts a strange event in 1666 when a field in Cranstead, Kent,
  was covered in small fish following a thunderstorm. The fish were estimated to be
  young whiting and were found in a two-acre field far from any water source. The
  phenomenon was witnessed by multiple people, including Mr. Lake, a Bencher of the
  Middle Temple, who brought one of the fish to London.
