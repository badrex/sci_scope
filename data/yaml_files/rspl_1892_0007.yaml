revised_title: Investigating the Clark Cell as a Standard of Electromotive Force
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the electromotive force of a Clark
  cell using a known resistance and the electrochemical equivalent of silver. They
  compare their results with Lord Rayleigh's standard cell and discuss the sources
  of error in the Clark cell and the effects of variations in materials and methods.
  The study contributes to the development of a standardized method for measuring
  electromotive force.
