revised_title: Brewster's Law and Phenomena of Thin Plates in Polarized Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Sir David Brewster investigates the phenomena of thin plates of solid and fluid
  substances exposed to polarized light, discovering an important law that governs
  the interference of polarized pencils reflected from the plate's surface. This law
  explains the formation of white-centered rings and the conditions under which no
  rings are produced.
