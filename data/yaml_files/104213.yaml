revised_title: Geometry of the Bases of Honeycomb Cells in Bees
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: The author examines the geometry of the bases of honeycomb cells in bees, discovering
  that they are formed by three equal rhombuses with obtuse angles of approximately
  109.28Â°. This design allows for the most efficient use of wax, the greatest regularity
  in construction, and ease of execution.
