revised_title: The Replacement of Electro-Positive Metals by Electro-Negative Metals
  in a Voltaic Cell
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The authors investigate the replacement of electro-positive metals by electro-negative
  metals in a voltaic cell, specifically focusing on the reaction between potassium
  chloride and magnesium connected with platinum. They observe the formation of potassium
  hydrate and hydrogen gas at the platinum plate, providing insights into the chemical
  reactions and theories of voltaic action.
