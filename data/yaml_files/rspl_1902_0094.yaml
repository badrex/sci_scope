revised_title: The Bending of Electric Waves Around a Conducting Obstacle
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of electric waves, including light waves,
  when they encounter a perfectly conducting obstacle. They find that there is no
  true shadow near the surface of the obstacle when the wave-length is small compared
  to the obstacle's size, and they discuss the conditions for shadow formation in
  this scenario.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Waves
- Conducting Materials
- Wave Propagation
- Shadow Formation
- Magnetic Forces
