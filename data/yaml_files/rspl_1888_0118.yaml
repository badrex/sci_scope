revised_title: 'On the Formation of Ternary Alloys: Lead, Tin, and Zinc'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the formation of ternary alloys composed of lead, tin,
  and zinc. They discover that certain proportions of these metals result in a single
  stable alloy, while other proportions lead to the separation into two different
  ternary mixtures. The study provides insights into the behavior of these alloys
  and their potential applications in various industries.
