revised_title: The Effect of Temperature and Chemical Composition on Reaction Rates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This paper investigates the effect of temperature and chemical composition on
  reaction rates, specifically focusing on the reaction between hydrogen dioxide and
  hydrogen iodide. The authors find that the rate of chemical change varies with temperature
  and the concentration of different substances in the reaction medium, and they propose
  a law of connection between chemical change and temperature.
topics:
- Chemical kinetics
- Reaction rate
- Temperature dependence
- Chemical equilibrium
- Reaction mechanisms
