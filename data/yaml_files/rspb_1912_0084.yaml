revised_title: Zooxanthella Monads in Merlia normani and Monticuliporas
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Sponge & Porifera Biology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between Merlia normani, a siliceous
  sponge with a supplementary calcareous skeleton, and the Zooxanthella monads within
  it. The monads undergo a resting phase in sponge cells and a motile phase outside,
  and their calcified corpses form the sponge's calcareous skeleton. The author also
  discusses the connection between Merlia normani and the Paleozoic Monticuliporas.
