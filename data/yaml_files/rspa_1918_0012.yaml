revised_title: Investigation of Ultra-violet Transparency in the Lower Atmosphere
  and Ozone Absorption
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of ultra-violet light through the lower
  atmosphere and finds that it is more transparent than the upper atmosphere. The
  study also reveals that the lower atmosphere's ability to transmit short wavelengths
  is not the same as the upper atmosphere, disproving previous assumptions.
