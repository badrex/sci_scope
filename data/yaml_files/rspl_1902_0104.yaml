revised_title: The Influence of Temperature on the Conductivity of Electrolytic Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the influence of temperature on the conductivity of
  electrolytic solutions and finds that the conductivities of all aqueous solutions
  approach a zero value at a similar temperature. The study suggests that the cause
  of this phenomenon is the disappearance of water's fluidity.
topics:
- Electrolytic Conductivity
- Temperature Coefficients
- Ion Mobility
- Dissociation
- Fluidity of Water
