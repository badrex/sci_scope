tldr: The author presents a series of hourly barometer observations made at the Royal
  Society, aiming to determine the laws governing its periodical changes and the circumstances
  that accelerate or retard them. The observations were conducted using three barometers
  over a period of fifteen days, with a focus on understanding the diurnal variation
  of the barometer and its relation to weather phenomena.
