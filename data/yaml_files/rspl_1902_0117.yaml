revised_title: Investigating the Constitution of Copper-Tin Alloys and Their Solidification
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors study the constitution of copper-tin alloys and their solidification
  process by chilling ingots at selected temperatures and analyzing the resulting
  microstructures. They determine the solidus curve, which reveals the temperature
  at which alloys become completely solid, and discuss the various chemical transformations
  that occur during solidification.
topics:
- Coppe
- Solidification
- Phase Diagrams
- Metallurgy
- Thermal Analysis
