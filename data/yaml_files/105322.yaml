revised_title: Improving Ventilator Operation with Fire-Engine Assistance
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Industrial Applications
tldr: Keane Fitz-Gerald proposes a new method to improve the operation of ventilators
  in mines by utilizing fire-engine technology. The device increases the number of
  strokes per minute and allows for a constant, one-way rotation, potentially saving
  lives in dangerous mining conditions.
