revised_title: The Role of Boiled Yeast-Juice in Alcoholic Fermentation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biotechnology
tldr: The authors discover that the addition of boiled and filtered yeast-juice significantly
  increases the rate of alcoholic fermentation in glucose solutions. They also find
  that the active component responsible for this increase can be separated through
  dialysis, creating an inactive residue and a dialysate that can reactivate the residue.
