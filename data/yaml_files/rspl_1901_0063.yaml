revised_title: 'Pharmacology of Pseudaconitine and Japaconitine: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: This study investigates the pharmacological properties of pseudaconitine and
  japaconitine, two toxic alkaloids found in Aconitum plants, and compares their effects
  on various physiological systems. The authors find that while there are differences
  in potency and specific effects, all three alkaloids share a similar constitutional
  type and have similar effects on the heart, respiratory system, and nervous system
  of test animals.
