revised_title: 'Opalescence in Fluids Near the Critical Temperature: Observations
  and Generalizations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of opalescence in fluids near the critical
  temperature, observing that the density and range of visible opalescence vary with
  temperature and volume. The study provides insights into the behavior of fluids
  at their critical point and suggests that the position of maximum opalescence depends
  on the mean specific volume of the substance.
