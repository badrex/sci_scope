scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the morphology of the sporophyte of Splachnum luteum,
  a moss, and describes its unique umbrella-shaped apophysis structure. The study
  provides insights into the plant's anatomy and development, potentially shedding
  light on the phylogeny of higher Cryptogams and Phanerogams.
