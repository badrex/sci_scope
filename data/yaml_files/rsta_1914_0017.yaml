revised_title: 'Enhanced Lines in Spark Spectra: The 4481 Series of Magnesium'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the enhanced lines in spark spectra, specifically the
  4481 series of magnesium. They discover that the line is a close doublet and provide
  accurate measurements of its wave-lengths. The findings have implications for understanding
  the behavior of enhanced lines in various elements and their relation to other known
  series in the respective spectra.
