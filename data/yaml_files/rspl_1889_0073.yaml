tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of free stream lines, focusing on
  the transformation theorems applicable to hydrodynamical problems. The study covers
  various cases, including jets from vessels, flow pipes, and streams against planes,
  providing insights into fluid dynamics and potential theory.
topics:
- Hydrodynamics
- Stream Lines
- Potential Theory
