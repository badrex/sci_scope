revised_title: The Connection between the Sun's Surface and the Earth's Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetosphere & Solar Physics
tldr: The author investigates the connection between the state of the sun's surface
  and the horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetism. By comparing daily changes
  in horizontal magnetic force at four stations with the spotted area of the sun's
  surface, the study reveals a correlation between high values of horizontal force
  and large sunspot areas, and low values with small sunspot areas.
