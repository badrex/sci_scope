revised_title: The Construction and Application of a Glycerine Barometer
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author describes the construction of a glycerine barometer, which uses glycerine
  instead of mercury to measure atmospheric pressure. The glycerine barometer has
  a lower density than a mercury barometer, allowing for a larger range of movement
  and easier visibility of pressure changes. The author also discusses the practical
  applications of this instrument in meteorology and weather monitoring.
