  Phascolarctos, Phascolomys, and Perameles'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: 'This study examines the development of the thymus, epithelial bodies, and thyroid
  in three marsupial species: Phascolarctos, Phascolomys, and Perameles. The research
  focuses on the origin and development of these glands and their similarities and
  differences across the species. The findings reveal the role of ectoderm and entoderm
  in the formation of the cervical thymus and the contribution of the ultimobranchial
  body to thyroid tissue.'
