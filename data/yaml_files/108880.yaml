  Rule for Equations'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates and demonstrates the validity of Newton's rule for finding
  an inferior limit to the number of imaginary roots of algebraic equations up to
  the fifth degree. Additionally, the author presents a rule for assigning a similar
  limit applicable to equations of the form Z(ax+b)m=O and determines the absolute
  invariantive criteria for fixing the character of the roots of an equation of the
  fifth degree.
