tldr: The authors examine the sources of nitrogen in vegetation, focusing on the role
  of nitric acid in soils and subsoils. They present new results and discuss the evidence
  in relation to other recent studies, concluding that the primary source of nitrogen
  for plants is the stores within the soil and subsoil.
