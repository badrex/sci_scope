revised_title: 'Harmonic Tidal Constants for Australian and Chinese Ports: A Study
  of Tidal Observations'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: This study investigates harmonic tidal constants for various Australian and
  Chinese ports, using observations from automatic tide gauges and times and heights
  of high and low water. The findings provide valuable data for tidal predictions
  and serve as a reference for future studies in geodetic surveying.
