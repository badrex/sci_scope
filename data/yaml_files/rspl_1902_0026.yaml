revised_title: Microscopic Analysis of Stress Effects on Platinum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the microscopic effects of stress on platinum, observing
  the development of fine stress bands and crystalline slip in the metal under compression.
  These findings confirm previous observations on the behavior of metals under stress
  and provide insight into the comparative behavior of platinum with other constructive
  metals.
