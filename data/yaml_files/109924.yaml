revised_title: Investigating the Anomaly in the Variation of the Magnetic Needle on
  Ship-Board
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: William Scoresby investigates the anomalies in magnetic observations on ship-board
  and suggests that the influence of iron used in the construction of the ship is
  a probable source. He provides a table of selected results from his observations
  conducted on the coast of Spitzbergen in 1815 and 1817, and deduces that the anomaly
  of attraction is greatest in men-of-war and ships containing large quantities of
  iron.
