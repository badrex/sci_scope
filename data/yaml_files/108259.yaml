revised_title: 'Researches in the Theory of Machines: A New Interpretation of Vis
  Viva'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Mechanics
tldr: The author presents a new interpretation of the vis viva principle, stating
  that half the vis viva represents the accumulated work in a moving body. This interpretation
  is applied to machines, showing how the difference between the work done by forces
  accelerating and retarding motion is equal to the accumulated work in the moving
  parts of the machine.
