  Part II'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study examines the peripheral distribution of the fibres of posterior roots
  in spinal nerves, focusing on the cervical and brachial regions, as well as the
  skin distribution of cranial nerves. The research provides insights into the organization
  and function of the nervous system, particularly in relation to sensory and motor
  nerve roots.
