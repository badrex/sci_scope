revised_title: 'Artificial Formation of Diamond: Experiments with Lithium and Gaseous
  Solvents'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the formation of diamond through chemical reactions
  with metals like lithium and sodium, and explores the use of gaseous solvents to
  create hard crystalline carbon. Although successful in producing hard carbon, the
  author does not achieve the synthesis of diamond in this study.
