revised_title: Investigating Secondary Electromotor Power in Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author explores the secondary electromotor power of nerves and its application
  to explaining certain electro-physiological phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that
  nerves acquire a secondary electromotor power when traversed by an electric current,
  which can produce a current in the opposite direction in a conducting circuit. This
  property is connected to the nerve's structure and ceases when its integrity is
  compromised.
