revised_title: The Torque Produced by a Beam of Light in Oblique Refraction through
  a Glass Plate
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the torque produced by a beam of light in oblique refraction
  through a glass plate, confirming the momentum principle and demonstrating the outward
  pull at incidence and emergence. They design and perform an experiment using a cube-shaped
  glass structure to measure the torque and compare it to theoretical calculations.
