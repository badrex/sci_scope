revised_title: Experiments on the Vibration of Stretched Wires in Closed Electric
  Circuits
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of wire vibration in a closed electric circuit
  and discovers that stretched wires can act as efficient microphones, producing sounds
  in telephones. The study explores various types of wires, their responsiveness,
  and the factors affecting their performance, such as resonance and the influence
  of the Earth's magnetic field.
