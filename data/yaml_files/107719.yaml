revised_title: Investigating the Distribution and Changes of Magnetic Intensity in
  Ships of War
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the distribution and
  changes of magnetic intensity in ships of war, using a magnetized bar and a delicate
  suspension system. The results show that the magnetic intensity varies depending
  on the ship's position and direction, with the lowest intensities found when the
  ship's head is east and the highest when north-west.
