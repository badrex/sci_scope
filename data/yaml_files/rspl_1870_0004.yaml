scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The Earl of Rosse continues his research on lunar heat radiation, confirming
  that a significant portion of the moon's heat is absorbed before being emitted as
  low refrangibility rays. He also explores the effect of atmospheric transparency
  on heat transmission and the relationship between lunar heat and altitude.

- Lunar Heat Radiation
- Atmospheric Transparency
- Heat Transmission
- Solar and Lunar Heat Comparison
- Thermodynamics
