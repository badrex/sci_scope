tldr: The authors investigate the chemical composition and decomposition of narcotine,
  focusing on opianic acid and its derivatives. They discover a new compound, methyl-noropianic
  acid, and study its properties and reactions. Additionally, they explore the decomposition
  of meconin and hemipinic acid, identifying new compounds and analyzing their properties.
