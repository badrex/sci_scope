tldr: The author describes a ctenostomatous polyzoon found on the Australian coast,
  comparing its structure and characteristics to those of Vesicularia and Bowerbankia.
  The polypidom exhibits a unique lace-like appearance and has distinct cellular and
  vascular structures. The polyps are minute but display similar features to those
  of Vesicularia and Bowerbankia, with differences in the number and arrangement of
  ciliated tentacula.
