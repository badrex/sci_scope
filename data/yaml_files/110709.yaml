revised_title: Tide Observations and Theoretical Curve Analysis
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The author analyzes tide observations from Plymouth, Liverpool, and Bristol,
  comparing them to the theoretical curve of tide rise and fall. The empirical curve
  shows a general agreement with the theoretical curve, but with deviations due to
  the asymmetrical nature of the rise and fall of the tides.
