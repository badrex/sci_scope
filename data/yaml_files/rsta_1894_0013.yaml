revised_title: On the Elliptic Polarization by Reflection and Refraction of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author examines the reflection and refraction of light, focusing on the
  elliptic polarization phenomenon. They propose a hypothesis of a thin, variable
  layer of transition between transparent media to explain the phenomenon. The study
  avoids using hypothetical conditions and provides expressions for the intensities
  and phases of reflected and refracted light, taking into account terms of order.
