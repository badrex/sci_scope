  Implications

tldr: The author investigates the role of diaphragm tension in respiration and its
  physiological implications. The study reveals that the passive tension of the diaphragm
  is essential for retaining supplemental air in the lungs, limiting the encroachment
  of abdominal viscera on the thoracic cavity, and maintaining the heart's movement
  during respiration. This tension also plays a role in the body's response to various
  conditions, such as pregnancy and ovarian tumors.
