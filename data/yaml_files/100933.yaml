tldr: Dr. Thomas Cornelio shares observations on tarantula stings and their effects,
  discussing the common belief that those affected are possessed by evil spirits.
  He suggests that the cause may be an inward disposition, similar to chorea Sti Viti
  in Germany, and hopes to provide further thoughts on the matter soon.
