scientific_subdiscipline: Geomagnetism & Aeronomy
tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of magnetic disturbances at Kew, focusing
  on the diurnal inequalities and their relationship to magnetic storms. The study
  reveals that the regular diurnal inequality on disturbed days is significantly different
  from that on quiet days, with larger ranges and altered phase angles. The findings
  emphasize the importance of uniformity in data from different stations and suggest
  that magnetic storms may be influenced by local time and altitude variations in
  electric conductivity.
