revised_title: On the Properties of Odd Numbers and Their Relation to the Roots of
  Four Squares
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author, Sir Frederick Pollock, investigates the properties of odd numbers
  and their relation to the roots of four squares. He demonstrates that odd numbers
  can be divided into four squares in a specific manner, with certain relations between
  the roots. This property also applies to even squares and numbers in arithmetic
  series. The author suggests that these properties may have been part of the mysterious
  properties of numbers used by Fermat in his theorem on polygonal numbers.
