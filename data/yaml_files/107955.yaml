scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Motion
tldr: The author investigates the long period inequalities in the motions of the Earth
  and Venus, calculating the numerical values of the coefficients and analyzing the
  effects of permanent variations on the inequality. The study provides a deeper understanding
  of celestial mechanics and the behavior of planetary motion.
