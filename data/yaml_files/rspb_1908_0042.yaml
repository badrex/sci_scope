revised_title: The Effect of Adrenal Cortex Extract on Secondary Sexual Characteristics
  in Birds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Hormones
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of adrenal cortex extract on the development
  of secondary sexual characteristics in birds, specifically wild ducks. They find
  that injecting the extract does not accelerate the appearance of these characteristics
  and may even cause a delay, suggesting that the cortex does not contain a specific
  substance that stimulates their development.
