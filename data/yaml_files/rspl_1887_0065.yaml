tldr: This paper presents experiments on the continuous extension of ice bars subjected
  to tension at low temperatures to study the viscosity of ice. The experiments were
  conducted in the Engadine and showed that ice stretches continuously, with the extension
  depending on the temperature and tensile stress. The author hopes to further investigate
  the extension's law in future experiments.
