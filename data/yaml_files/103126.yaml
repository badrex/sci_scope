revised_title: Microscopic Observations of Animalcula in Semine of Young Rams
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Development
tldr: The author examines the animalcula in the semen of young rams using a microscope
  and discovers that they can survive for up to 32 hours after the ram's death. This
  suggests that the animalcula may take 2-3 days to reach the womb of the female after
  copulation, before receiving nourishment and potentially impregnating the female.
