scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: Thomas Huxley examines the anatomy and reproduction of Salpa and Pyrosoma, two
  types of ascidians, and challenges the concept of 'alternate generations' in these
  organisms. He describes the organs and reproductive processes in both species and
  argues that they should not be considered as distinct generations but rather as
  'zooids,' or functional units within a larger organism.
