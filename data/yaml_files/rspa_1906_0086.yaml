revised_title: Investigation of Continuous Rays in Spark Spectra of Metalloids and
  Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the continuous rays in spark spectra of metalloids and
  metals, finding that the nature of the surrounding gas has a significant influence
  on the spectra. The continuous spectrum is strongest in hydrogen and nitrogen, and
  weakest in oxygen-containing atmospheres, suggesting that oxidation does not cause
  the continuous spectrum.
