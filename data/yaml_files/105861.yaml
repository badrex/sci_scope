revised_title: The Luminousness of Sea Water and the Role of Putrefaction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine & Aquatic Biology
tldr: John Canton's experiments demonstrate that the luminousness of sea water arises
  from the putrefaction of its animal substances, with salt in sea water accelerating
  the process. The bioluminescence is observed in artificial sea water with similar
  salt content, indicating that the salt plays a significant role in the phenomenon.
