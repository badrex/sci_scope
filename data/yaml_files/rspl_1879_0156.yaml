revised_title: The Lowering of the Freezing-Point of Water by Pressure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: James Dewar investigates the effect of pressure on the freezing point of water
  using the Cailletet pump and a series of experiments. He finds that the freezing
  point of water decreases as pressure increases, with a mean reduction of 0.0072
  degrees Celsius per atmosphere of pressure.
