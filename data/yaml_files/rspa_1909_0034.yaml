revised_title: Further Investigation of Helium Liberation from Radioactive Minerals
  through Grinding
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the liberation of helium from radioactive minerals by
  grinding them into finer particles. They find that a higher percentage of helium
  is released from the minerals as the size of the particles decreases, suggesting
  that the helium is mechanically trapped within the mineral structures.
