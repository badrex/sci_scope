  Crystals
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a theorem for solving definite integrals involving the sum
  of three cubes and extends Poisson's solution of partial differential equations
  to include an infinite series of arbitrary constants. Additionally, the author investigates
  the force function in crystals and their stress distribution.
topics:
- Integral Calculus
- Partial Differential Equations
- Crystallography
