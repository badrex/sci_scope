revised_title: Experimental Researches on Induction and Electric Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Faraday investigates the nature of electric forces and induction, proposing
  that all particles are conductors and that induction occurs through insulating dielectrics.
  He also discusses the limitations and exclusivity of electric power, as well as
  the differences between free and induced charges.
