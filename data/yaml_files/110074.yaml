revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Air Density on Chronometer Rates
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Measurement
tldr: George Harvey examines the impact of air density on chronometer rates, discovering
  that they gain time in less dense air and lose time in denser air. He also finds
  that pocket chronometers are more affected than box chronometers and that the changes
  in rate are independent of temperature changes.
