revised_title: 'The Effects of Heat and Solvents on Thin Films of Metal: A Study of
  Transparence and Reflecting Power'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Surface Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the effects of heat and solvents on thin metal films,
  focusing on their transparency and reflecting power. The author explores the behavior
  of surface films during heating and suggests that the molecules' behavior can be
  explained by the hypothesis that they act like liquid metal molecules under the
  influence of surface tension.
