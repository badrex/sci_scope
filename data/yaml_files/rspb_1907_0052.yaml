revised_title: The Impact of Heat Production and Loss on Uric Acid Output in the Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between uric acid output and heat production
  in the body. The authors found that exposure to cold and loss of heat significantly
  increased uric acid production, while muscular exertion had a lesser effect. This
  suggests that the body's reaction to heat loss plays a significant role in uric
  acid production, and that this reaction may involve a distinct form of activity
  separate from voluntary muscle movements.
