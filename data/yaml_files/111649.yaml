revised_title: Investigation of the Expansion of Metals and Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the expansion rates of various metals and alloys, finding
  that the purity of the metals significantly affects their expansion coefficients.
  They also explore the influence of molecular state, crystallization, and tempering
  on the expansion of metals and alloys.
topics:
- Metal Expansion
- Alloy Properties
- Metal Purity
- Coefficient of Linear Expansion
- Heat Conductivity
