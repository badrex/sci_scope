revised_title: Exploring New Geometrical Curves through Solid Sections
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a new method of considering geometrical curves from the
  sections of a solid, which extends our understanding of their nature and properties.
  This method involves creating an incurvated surface using right lines and can be
  applied to various sections, resulting in infinite lines and curves such as hyperbolas
  and parabolas.
