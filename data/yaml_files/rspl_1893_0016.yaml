revised_title: The Accurate Determination of Water Composition by Volume
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Atomic Weights
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the composition of
  water by volume, using improved apparatus and various sources of hydrogen and oxygen.
  The mean ratio of hydrogen to oxygen found is 2:1, with a most probable value of
  2:00245. This result, combined with the ratio of densities, provides an accurate
  atomic weight for oxygen.
