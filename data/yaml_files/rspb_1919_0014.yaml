revised_title: 'Multinucleate Cells in Vegetative Tissues: A Comprehensive Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the occurrence of multinucleate cells in the vegetative
  tissues of 177 species across various plant families. They observe that multinucleate
  cells are common in Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms, Monocotyledons, and Dicotyledons,
  and suggest that a binucleate or multinucleate stage may be a normal phase of development
  between meristematic and adult conditions.
