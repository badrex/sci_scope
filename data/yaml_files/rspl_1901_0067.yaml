tldr: The Solar Physics Observatory Eclipse expedition, led by Sir Norman Lockyer,
  observed the total solar eclipse of May 28, 1900, from Santa Pola, Spain. They used
  coronagraphs, prismatic cameras, and other instruments to study the corona, prominences,
  and chromosphere. The observations revealed changes in prominence appearances, the
  heights of coronal vapors, and the bright-line spectrum of the corona.
