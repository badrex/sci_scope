revised_title: Artificial Rhythm in Medusae and its Implications on Locomotion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuroscience
tldr: The author investigates the artificial rhythm in various species of Medusae
  and concludes that the natural rhythm of these animals is influenced by an alternate
  process of exhaustion and restoration of excitability in their ganglionic tissues.
  This research suggests that the natural rhythm is not solely due to the intermittent
  nature of the ganglionic charge but also depends on the excitability of the responding
  tissues.
