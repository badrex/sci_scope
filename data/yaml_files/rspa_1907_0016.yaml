revised_title: Experiments on the Length of the Cathode Dark Space with Varying Current
  Densities and Pressures in Different Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the length of the cathode dark space in various gases
  under different current densities and pressures. The results show a linear relationship
  between the length of the dark space and pressure, and the findings contribute to
  the understanding of the mechanism of electrical conduction.
topics:
- Cathode Dark Space
- Current Densities
- Gas Pressures
