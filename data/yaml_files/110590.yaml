revised_title: Astronomical Refractions and Atmospheric Density
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author discusses the problem of atmospheric refractions and the need to
  investigate the temperature gradient in the atmosphere to reconcile theory with
  observation. He critiques previous solutions by Newton, Laplace, and Biot, and presents
  his own views in an accompanying paper.
