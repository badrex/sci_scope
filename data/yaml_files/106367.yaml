scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a new method for assaying copper ores using a combination
  of acids and metals to separate and precipitate copper from other elements. This
  method is efficient, requires minimal equipment, and can be performed by those with
  little to no chemistry knowledge.
