revised_title: Electrolytic Conduction of Some Organic Bodies and the Effect of Mixing
  with Alcohol
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrolytic conduction of various organic compounds
  and find that when mixed with alcohol, their conductivity increases, suggesting
  a possible explanation for their decomposition by the copper-zinc couple.
