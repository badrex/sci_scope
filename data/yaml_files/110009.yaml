revised_title: Effects of Percussion on the Development of Magnetical Properties in
  Steel and Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author, William Scoresby, investigates the development of magnetic properties
  in steel and iron through percussion. He discovers that hammering a bar of soft
  steel on various surfaces affects its magnetic power, and that the length of the
  bars influences the magnetism gained. He also examines the effects of percussion
  on soft steel magnets and cast iron, finding that the lifting power varies depending
  on the material and treatment.
