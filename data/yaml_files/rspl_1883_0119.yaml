scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Applications
tldr: The author presents a new method for finding unknown periodicities in a series
  of observations, such as magnetical, meteorological, or astronomical data. The method
  involves analyzing the mean series of observations and determining the relationships
  between the series to uncover the periodic patterns.
