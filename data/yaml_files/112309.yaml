revised_title: Excyclic Distribution and Double Determinants
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Discrete Mathematics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory on excyclic distribution, a type of
  arrangement where no closed circuit of double colors exists between urns. The theory
  involves double determinants and polynomial functions, with applications in combinatorics
  and mathematical modeling.
