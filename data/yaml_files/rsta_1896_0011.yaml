revised_title: Investigating the Structure and Properties of Metal Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of adding various elements to gold, finding
  that the atomic volume of the added element plays a significant role in the metal's
  tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area. They also discuss the importance
  of understanding the visible and molecular structures of metals and alloys in determining
  their mechanical properties.
