revised_title: Crystallographic and Optical Properties of Monoclinic Double Selenates
  of the Copper Group
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: This study investigates the crystallographic and optical properties of four
  double selenates of the copper group, including potassium, rubidium, caesium, and
  ammonium salts. The crystals were analyzed for their forms, interfacial angles,
  molecular volume, refractive indices, and optical constants, providing insights
  into their structure and behavior.
