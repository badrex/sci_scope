scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Water Science & Management
tldr: The author, John Bostock, examines the spontaneous purification of Thames water
  and discovers that the impurities in the water undergo a fermentation process, which
  removes the organic substances and leaves behind salts. The more foul the water,
  the more complete the purification, which explains the popular belief that Thames
  water is suitable for use at sea.
