scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author introduces the concept of quadric inversion of plane curves, a generalization
  of the method of inversion, and establishes its general principles. The paper discusses
  the properties of inverse curves, their orders, and the relation between the primitive
  and its inverse curve.
