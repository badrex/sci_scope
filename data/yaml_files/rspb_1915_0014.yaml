revised_title: The Impact of Functional Activity on Organ Metabolism, Blood Flow,
  and Exudation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of functional activity on metabolism, blood
  flow, and exudation in organs, specifically focusing on striated muscle and the
  submaxillary gland. The research demonstrates that functional activity leads to
  increased oxygen consumption, blood flow, and exudation in these organs, with effects
  lasting for 2-3 hours post-stimulation.
