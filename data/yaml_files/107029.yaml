revised_title: A Study of Submarine Forests off the East Coast of England
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author investigates a submarine forest off the East Coast of England, discovering
  that it consists of decayed trees and is visible only during the lowest tides. The
  trees, primarily birch, fir, and oak, are found in a soft greasy clay soil and are
  flattened, suggesting heavy pressure from a superimposed stratum. The author speculates
  on the possible age and agency responsible for the destruction of this forest.
