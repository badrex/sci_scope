revised_title: 'The Formation of Spars and Crystals: A Hypothesis on the Role of Saline
  Corpuscles'
scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author proposes a hypothesis on the formation of spars, crystals, and possibly
  jewels, suggesting that they are formed by the accumulation of crystalline (saline)
  corpuscles carried by moisture through porous stones and earth. The author also
  speculates that the size and transparency of these substances depend on the rate
  of moisture flow and the size of the pores in which they form.
