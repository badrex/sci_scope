  and Gyrus Fornicatus in Monkeys

tldr: The author investigates the descending degenerations that occur after lesions
  of the gyrus marginalis and gyrus fornicatus in monkeys. The study finds that the
  main feature of interest is the localization of degeneration to the postero-lateral
  part of the crossed pyramidal tract area of the cord. The results suggest that the
  gyrus fornicatus may be involved in the reception of sensory impressions and could
  potentially send centrifugal nervous impulses along the motor tract.
