revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Power of Metals and Other Solids to
  Induce the Combination of Gaseous Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Reactions
tldr: Faraday investigates the power of metals, specifically platinum, to induce the
  combination of gaseous bodies, such as oxygen and hydrogen, at common or low temperatures.
  He discovers that the positive pole of a voltaic pile can cause the combination
  of these gases, leading to new phenomena and potential interference with electrochemical
  decompositions.
