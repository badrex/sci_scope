revised_title: Demonstration of Two Theorems in Geometry
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author demonstrates two theorems related to polygons and their angles. The
  first theorem states that the sum of perpendiculars drawn from angular points to
  parallel lines is equal, while the second theorem shows that the intercepted parts
  of the parallels are equal to the corresponding sides multiplied by the cosine of
  the sums of exterior angles.
