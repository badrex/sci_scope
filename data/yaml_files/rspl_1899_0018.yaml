revised_title: Differences in Thermal Expansion Coefficients of Pure Nickel and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author re-determines the coefficients of thermal expansion for nickel and
  cobalt using a refined interference dilatometer. The results show that nickel, with
  a slightly lower atomic weight, expands more than cobalt, with the difference increasing
  with temperature.
