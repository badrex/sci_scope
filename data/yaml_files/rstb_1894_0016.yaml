revised_title: Experimental and Histological Investigation of Cerebellum Lesions in
  Monkeys
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments on monkeys to study the effects
  of cerebellum lesions and the resulting degenerations. They investigate the effects
  of total or partial cerebellar extirpation, cerebellar peduncle section, and tubercle
  destruction on the medulla oblongata. The research aims to determine the secondary
  degenerations caused by these lesions using experimental and histological methods.
