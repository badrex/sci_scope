  Laws'

tldr: Karl Pearson develops a generalized theory of alternative inheritance, which
  replaces Mendel's simple couplet with multiple couplets and does not rely on dominant
  and recessive characters. This theory demonstrates broad features of inheritance
  in populations, aligning with biometric theory and showing that regression of offspring
  on any ancestor is linear.
