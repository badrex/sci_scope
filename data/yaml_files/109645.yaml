scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Exploration
tldr: John Jerome Schroeter presents observations and measurements of the planet Vesta,
  made in collaboration with Dr. Olbers and Mr. Bessel. They find Vesta to be a small,
  intense, and unsteady light source, with an apparent diameter of only 4-8ths of
  a second, similar to the 4th satellite of Saturn. The findings are significant given
  Vesta's location between Mars and Jupiter, where other recently discovered planets
  also orbit.
