revised_title: Investigation of Magnetic Behavior of Iron and Other Metals under Oscillatory
  Discharge from a Condenser
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic behavior of iron and other metals under
  oscillatory discharge from a condenser. They find that the rapid damping of the
  oscillations is due to the absorption of energy by the iron cores, either through
  hysteresis or eddy currents, or both. The experiments show that hysteresis loss
  is almost negligible compared to eddy-current loss.
