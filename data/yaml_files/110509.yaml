tldr: J.W. Lubbock presents 19 years of tide observations at the London Docks, discussing
  the relationship between high water height and atmospheric pressure, as well as
  the influence of wind on tides. The study supports Bernoulli's views on tidal phenomena
  and provides corrections for observers using solar time instead of mean time.
