revised_title: The Stability of a Rotating Spheroid of Perfect Liquid
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Oceanography
tldr: The author investigates the stability of a rotating spheroid of perfect liquid
  and finds that the limit of eccentricity consistent with stability is determined
  by the type of displacement and the spheroidal sectorial harmonic of the cond degree.
  The study focuses on ordinary stability, as distinguished from secular stability.

- Hydrodynamics
- Fluid Mechanics
- Rotating Liquids
- Spheroidal Harmonics
