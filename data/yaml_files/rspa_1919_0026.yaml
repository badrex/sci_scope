revised_title: The Spectral Analysis of Sulphur Vapour
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the spectral changes in sulfur vapor as the temperature
  increases, discovering that the absorption spectrum shortens and then lengthens
  as the temperature rises, with a reversal point at around 650Â°C. This study provides
  evidence of molecular complexity changes in sulfur vapor and contributes to the
  understanding of its constitution.
