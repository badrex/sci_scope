scientific_subdiscipline: Protozoology & Parasitology
tldr: The authors investigate the chromosome cycle in Coccidia and Gregarines, finding
  that nuclear divisions are mitotic and chromosome numbers are constant. Reduction
  occurs immediately after fertilization, rather than during gametogenesis.
