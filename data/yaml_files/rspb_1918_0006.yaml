revised_title: 'Serological Differentiation of Bacillus Tetani: Isolation and Infection'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the isolation and serological differentiation of Bacillus
  tetani, discovering that there are at least three serological types of the bacteria.
  The study suggests that current antitoxin preparations may not fully protect against
  all types of B. tetani, highlighting the need for further research and development
  of more effective treatments for tetanus infections.
