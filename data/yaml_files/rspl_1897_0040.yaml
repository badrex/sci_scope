revised_title: Determination of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors use a hydraulic brake to measure the mechanical equivalent of heat
  by controlling the temperature and flow of water through the brake. They determine
  the mechanical equivalent of the total heat necessary to raise the temperature of
  water over the standard interval, obtaining a mean specific heat between the freezing
  and boiling points.
