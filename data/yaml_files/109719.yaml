  Patients

tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines the blood of diabetes patients
  and finds no detectable sugar levels. He suggests that the formation of sugar in
  diabetes may result from a process of imperfect assimilation in the stomach, rather
  than a new power assumed by the kidneys. Wollaston also investigates the possibility
  of fluids passing from the stomach to the bladder without passing through the blood,
  but concludes that further experiments on living animals are needed to understand
  this process.
