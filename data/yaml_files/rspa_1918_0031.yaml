  Fibers
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This study investigates the effects of stress, moisture, and heat on textile
  fibers, revealing that they exhibit double refraction due to internal stresses and
  can be permanently deformed by pressure. The fibers' behavior is analyzed under
  various conditions, including compression, bending, twisting, and exposure to water
  and heat.
