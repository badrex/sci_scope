revised_title: Heat Disengaged during Metallic Substitutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Thomas Andrews investigates the heat evolved during metallic substitutions and
  establishes a general principle that when an equivalent of one metal replaces another
  in a solution of its salts, the heat developed is the same with the same metals.
  This principle applies to any number of metals in specific relationships.
