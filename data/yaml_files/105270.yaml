revised_title: Improving Steam Generation in Fire-Engines
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates methods to increase the quantity of steam in a fire-engine
  and discovers that the previous method of forcing air through boiling water was
  not effective. Instead, the author suggests a new design for the bellows and a different
  method of steam generation, which results in a more efficient use of coal and increased
  water displacement.
