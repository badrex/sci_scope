tldr: Dr. William Herschel observes a second comet and compares its physical construction
  to that of a planet. He estimates the comet's diameter to be about one-third that
  of Earth and its light to be reflected from the sun. The comet's chevelure, or tail,
  is believed to consist of phosphoric matter suspended in an elastic atmosphere.
