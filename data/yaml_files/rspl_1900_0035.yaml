revised_title: 'The Demarcation Current of Mammalian Nerve: Source Considered as a
  Concentration Cell'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the demarcation current in mammalian nerves and find
  that it is influenced by the salt content of the nerve. They propose that the demarcation
  current is caused by a balance between two osmotic processes, one at the cross-section
  and one at the longitudinal surface of the nerve.
