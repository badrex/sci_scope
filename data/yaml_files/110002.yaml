revised_title: On the Expansion of the Attraction of a Spheroid in a Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author, James Ivory, investigates the expansion of a spheroid's attraction
  in a series and proposes a more direct and simple method for its development. He
  also discusses the limitations of Laplace's method and the importance of the spheroid's
  radius being a function of three rectangular coordinates for equilibrium.
