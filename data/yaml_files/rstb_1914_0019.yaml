revised_title: The Auricular Excitatory Process in the Dog's Heart
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the origin and propagation of the excitatory process
  in the dog's heart, focusing on the auricles. The researchers use electrical methods
  and electrocardiography to analyze the wave of excitation and contraction, providing
  insights into the heart's function and potential treatments for heart-related issues.
