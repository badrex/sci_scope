scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the changes in breathing and blood composition at various
  altitudes, focusing on the effects of altitude on the lung ventilation and the percentage
  of haemoglobin in the blood. The research was conducted on residents at altitudes
  ranging from 5,100 to 12,500 feet in Colorado, and the results provide insights
  into the human body's adaptation to high altitudes.
