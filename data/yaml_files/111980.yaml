tldr: Sir George Everest proposes to re-examine the southern portion of the Great
  Indian Arc of the Meridian, originally surveyed by Colonel Lambton, to improve the
  accuracy and collect the results in a single volume. He suggests that recomputations
  and adjustments should be made due to changes in constants and formulae since the
  original survey. The Royal Society should consider this as a national question and
  use their influence to have the necessary measures taken.
