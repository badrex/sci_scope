revised_title: The Presence of Tyrosinases in the Skins of Pigmented Vertebrates
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental & Reproductive Biology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of tyrosinases in the skins of pigmented
  animals, such as rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens, and finds that these
  extracts can act on tyrosin to produce pigmented substances. This suggests the presence
  of a tyrosinase in the skins of these animals, which is responsible for the formation
  of pigments in accordance with the animal's color.
