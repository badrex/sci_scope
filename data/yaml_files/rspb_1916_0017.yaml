revised_title: Gelatinous Spicules in a New Genus of Siliceous Sponges
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: The author discovers gelatinous spicules in a new genus of siliceous sponges,
  which are composed of colloidal silica and have a unique mode of origin. These spicules,
  called colloscleres, are found in the sponge's mesogloea and are associated with
  large spherical cells, which the author believes to be their mother cells or scleroblasts.
