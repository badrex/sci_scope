tldr: The late Reverend Mr. John Ray observed the 1664 comet in Rome and documented

  tail pointed towards the heart of Hydra, and its brightness and size increased over
  time. Due to cloudy weather, observations were not possible on December 24, 25,
  and 26. By December 28, the comet had moved towards the bright triangle in the buttocks
  of Canis Major.
