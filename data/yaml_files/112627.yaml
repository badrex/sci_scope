  on Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathology
tldr: The author, John Davy, conducts experiments on the effects of freezing on various
  animals, including leeches, frogs, toads, and insects. He finds that congelation
  is fatal to animal life and discusses the possible causes of death, such as the
  freezing of organs and changes in blood corpuscles. The author also examines the
  effects of freezing on the crystalline lens, muscles, and other organs.
