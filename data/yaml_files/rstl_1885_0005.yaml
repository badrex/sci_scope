revised_title: Magnetic Rotation of Light in Bisulphide of Carbon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic rotation of light in bisulphide of carbon
  and discovers that the rotation is proportional to the difference of magnetic potential
  at different points along the ray of light. The study also highlights the importance
  of accurately defining the type of light used in experiments to avoid significant
  errors in results.
