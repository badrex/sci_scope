revised_title: The Influence of Vapour-Density on Fractional Distillation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the influence of vapour-density on the distillation
  of mixtures, demonstrating that the less volatile constituent can sometimes boil
  faster due to higher vapour-density. This phenomenon helps explain the difficulty
  in separating homologous bodies through fractional distillation and the distillation
  behavior of oils and other complex substances.
