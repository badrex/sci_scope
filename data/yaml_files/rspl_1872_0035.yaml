tldr: The magnetic survey of Belgium in 1871 revealed significant disturbances in
  the country's magnetic field, particularly in the south-east region. The coal measures
  across this area exert a strong disturbing influence, masking the normal direction
  of magnetic lines. The study confirms suspicions of irregularity and provides a
  complete list of magnetic elements observed at various stations.
