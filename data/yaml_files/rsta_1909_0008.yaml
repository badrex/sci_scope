revised_title: Investigating the Osmotic Pressures of Aqueous Calcium Ferrocyanide
  Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the osmotic pressures, vapour pressures, and densities
  of aqueous solutions of calcium ferrocyanide. They find that the osmotic pressures
  can be determined using the lowering of the solution's vapour pressure and the influence
  of the solution's compression and solvent's compression. The study provides a comprehensive
  analysis of the properties of these solutions and their potential applications in
  osmotic phenomena research.
