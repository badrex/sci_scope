scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This study investigates the distribution of temperature in the Alps, observing
  significant irregularities at lower heights and a connection between isothermal
  lines and the mean elevation of mountainous regions. The research also examines
  the influence of surface forms on temperature, the depression of temperature with
  elevation, and the snow line's relationship with isothermals.
