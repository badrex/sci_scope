revised_title: Experiments on the Properties of Liquefied Hydrochloric Acid Gas
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the properties of liquefied hydrochloric acid gas by
  subjecting various solid substances to its action under high pressure. The experiments
  reveal the gas's weak conductivity of electricity and its limited ability to dissolve
  or alter various substances, such as charcoal, boracic acid, and phosphorus.
