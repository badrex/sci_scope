scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Navigation
tldr: The author presents a new machine called the Marine Surveyor, designed to measure
  a ship's progress at sea more accurately than the current log method. The device
  uses a set of rotating fins to track the vessel's movement, and it has potential
  applications in determining the strength of tides along coastlines.
