revised_title: 'On the Density of Solid Mercury: A Reassessment of Historical Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: The author redetermines the density of solid mercury using a specific-gravity
  flask and freezing mixtures, providing a more accurate measurement than previous
  historical experiments. The study highlights the importance of precise instrumental
  means and temperature control in obtaining reliable results.
