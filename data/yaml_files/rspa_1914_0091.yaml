scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the 27-day period in magnetic phenomena and its potential
  association with sunspots and other solar occurrences. They analyze magnetic records
  and propose a method to measure magnetic disturbance using daily ranges of declination,
  horizontal force, and vertical force. The study aims to understand the relationship
  between the 27-day period and various solar and lunar phenomena.
