revised_title: The Fluid State of Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The authors investigate the properties of fluid chlorine, created by heating
  hydrates of chlorine under pressure. They discover that the fluid is highly volatile
  and can be condensed into a liquid state, opening up possibilities for further research
  on gas compression and condensation.
