  to Genera'

tldr: Francis Galton investigates the patterns formed by papillary ridges on thumbs
  and fingers, discovering that there are nine main classes of patterns and that these
  patterns are permanent throughout life. The study also shows that these patterns
  resemble isolated genera, suggesting that their classification is not influenced
  by natural selection.
