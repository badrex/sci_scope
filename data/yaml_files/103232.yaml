revised_title: Microscopic Observations on the Tongue Structure and Taste Sensation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: Anthony van Leeuwenhoek's microscopical observations on the tongue reveal its
  structure and the presence of numerous small particles that may play a role in taste
  sensation. He also describes the process of taste perception, suggesting that these
  particles interact with the tongue's surface and roof of the mouth to produce the
  sensation of taste.
