revised_title: Investigating the Spectrum of Nitrogen and the Formation of Oxides
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of nitrogen and discovers that pure nitrogen
  produces a line-spectrum, while the fluted spectrum is due to the presence of oxides
  of nitrogen formed under the influence of the electric spark. The author also finds
  that the presence of oxygen is necessary for the formation of the fluted spectrum.
