tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of colors exhibited by thin plates and
  discovers new fringes consisting of prismatic colors. These fringes are formed by
  the intersections of two sets of concentric rings and are divided into two classes
  based on the position of their colors. The author also explores different apparatuses
  to produce these fringes and their unique appearances.
