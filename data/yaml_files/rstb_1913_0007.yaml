scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of environmental effects, such as somatic
  induction and parallel induction, in the Daphnid Simocephalus vetulus. They conduct
  experiments on three different characters influenced by environmental factors and
  find that these effects can be passed on to offspring, demonstrating the role of
  the environment in inheritance.
