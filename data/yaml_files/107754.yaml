revised_title: Investigating Magnetism in Copper and Other Substances During Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author conducts experiments to investigate the development of magnetism
  in copper and other substances during rotation. The results indicate that the magnetism
  in the disk is instantaneously developed and destroyed by the rotating magnets,
  suggesting that the time taken for the induced magnetism to be retained is less
  than half a revolution of the magnet.
