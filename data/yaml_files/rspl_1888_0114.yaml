revised_title: The Influence of Light on Magnetism in Iron Bars
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the effect of light on the magnetism of iron bars and
  discovers that they are sensitive to the action of light, causing a deflection in
  the magnetometer. The effect is believed to be primarily caused by the direct action
  of radiation.
