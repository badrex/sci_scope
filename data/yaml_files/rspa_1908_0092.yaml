revised_title: A Reassessment of the Sellmeier Dispersion Formula
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author examines the Sellmeier dispersion formula and its compatibility with
  observed values of refractive indices and dielectric constants. The author identifies
  discrepancies in the formula and discusses possible solutions, such as considering
  absorption bands or exploring alternative dispersion formulas.
