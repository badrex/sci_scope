revised_title: Refractive Indices of Gaseous Nitric Oxide, Sulphur Dioxide, and Sulphur
  Trioxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive indices of gaseous nitric oxide, sulphur
  dioxide, and sulphur trioxide, finding that their refractivities deviate significantly
  from the additive values. The study provides insights into the behavior of nitrogen
  and sulfur compounds in the gas phase and contributes to the understanding of their
  refractive properties.
