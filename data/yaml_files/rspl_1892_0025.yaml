scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Sciences & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the factors that cause dense condensation in steam jets,
  identifying five ways to change ordinary condensation into the dense form, including
  electrification, increased dust nuclei, low air temperature, high steam pressure,
  and obstructions in the jet's path.
