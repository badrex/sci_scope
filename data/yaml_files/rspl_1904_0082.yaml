scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: This article presents a generalization of the gamma function and explores its
  properties, including difference equations, Weierstrassian forms, multiplication
  theorems, and Bessel functions. The author also discusses the function's connection
  to Euler's gamma function and its constant.
topics:
- Gamma Function
- Difference Equations
- Weierstrassian Forms
