revised_title: The Role of Intrinsic Factors and Proprioceptive Reflexes in the Act
  of Progression in Mammals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the intrinsic factors and proprioceptive reflexes involved
  in the act of progression in mammals. They find that the spinal cord plays a significant
  role in determining the movements of progression, and that proprioceptive stimuli
  from muscles, joints, and tendons contribute to the coordination of these movements.
