  Acid Formation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the ability of blood to absorb oxygen and expel carbonic
  acid through experiments on sheep and human blood. The results show that blood can
  absorb oxygen and that the absorption is affected by temperature, with higher temperatures
  leading to less oxygen absorption and less difference between venous and arterial
  blood.
