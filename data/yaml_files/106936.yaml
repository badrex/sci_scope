revised_title: Investigating the Color of Blood and the Role of Air
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hematology & Blood Disorders
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if the color change in blood is
  due to the interaction with air or changes in its composition. The results show
  that air does not alter the color of blood, suggesting that other factors, such
  as the optical properties of blood, play a more significant role in the color change.
