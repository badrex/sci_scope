tldr: The author presents two successful cases of treating diseased knee-joints, one
  through topical applications and the other through surgery. The first case involved
  the use of emollient fomentations, mercurial frictions, and gentle purges, while
  the second case required an operation to evacuate the extravasated fluid within
  the capsular ligament. Both patients recovered and regained mobility, demonstrating
  the effectiveness of these treatment methods.
