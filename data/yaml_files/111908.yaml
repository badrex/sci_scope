revised_title: 'Diagnosis of Diamines: A Study on Poly-Ammonias'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Coordination Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the properties of diamines and their derivatives, particularly
  focusing on the formation of specific salts to determine their atomicity. This method
  can be used to diagnose diamines in compounds of uncertain origin and provide evidence
  for their atomic structure.

- Ammonia Chemistry
- Diamines
- Ammonium Compounds
- Iodide Reactions
- Atomicity of Ammonias
