revised_title: Investigating Muscular Action and Electrical Interactions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author examines muscular action from an electrical perspective, investigating
  the relationship between muscle contraction and electrical currents. The study finds
  that the muscular current weakens during contraction, suggesting that muscular contraction
  may be antagonized by the muscular and nerve currents.
