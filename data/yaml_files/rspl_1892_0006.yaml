  Machinery
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering
tldr: The authors experimentally verify the effect of armature currents on the magnetic
  field and electromotive force in dynamo-electric machines, finding that the current
  in the armature causes a disturbance in the distribution of induction over the pole-piece
  and affects the overall performance of the machine.
