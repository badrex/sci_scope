revised_title: 'Chromosome Dimensions and Phylogeny: A Study on Ferns and Primula
  Hybrids'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Genomics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between chromosome dimensions and phylogeny
  in various plant species, including ferns and Primula hybrids. They find that while
  some plants show a correlation between cell size and chromosome number, others do
  not, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic
  dimensions.
