revised_title: Secular Changes in the Elements of a Satellite's Orbit Due to Tidal
  Distortion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics
tldr: This paper investigates the effects of tidal forces on the orbit and rotation
  of a satellite around a tidally distorted planet. The author demonstrates that these
  forces cause changes in the satellite's orbit, the planet's rotation, and the inclination
  of their respective planes over time. The study suggests that the moon and Earth
  initially had a closer proximity and faster rotation, and proposes a theory for
  the evolution of our planetary system based on tidal interactions.
