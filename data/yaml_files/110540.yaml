revised_title: Muscular Fibre Structure in Animal and Organic Life
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: Frederick Skey examines the structure of muscular fibers in animal and organic
  life through microscopic analysis. He finds that human muscular fibers have an average
  diameter of one 400th of an inch and are surrounded by transverse circular striations.
  Skey also notes differences in the structure of fibers in various parts of the body
  and in organic life.
