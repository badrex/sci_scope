revised_title: Investigating the Cause of Colored Concentric Rings and Other Similar
  Appearances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the cause of colored concentric rings and other similar
  appearances, demonstrating that the configuration of these phenomena is determined
  by the curvature of the surfaces in contact. Experiments with cylindrical, spherical,
  and irregular surfaces reveal the effects of their curvature on the formation and
  shape of colored rings and streaks.
