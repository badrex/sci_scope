revised_title: The Relation between the Sun's Altitude and Chemical Intensity of Total
  Daylight
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the sun's altitude and the
  chemical intensity of total daylight in a cloudless sky. The authors found that
  the mean chemical intensity of total daylight at hours equidistant from noon remains
  the same. They also discovered that the relation between the total chemical intensity
  and solar altitude is represented by a straight line for altitudes above 10Â°. The
  variation in the direction of the straight line is due to the opalescence of the
  atmosphere, and the higher intensity is found where the mean temperature of the
  air is greater.
