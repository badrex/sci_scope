revised_title: Inertness of Argon in Reaction with Fluor
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The authors investigate the reaction between fluor and argon and find that no
  chemical reaction occurs at ordinary temperatures or under the influence of an induction
  spark. This demonstrates the inertness of argon in chemical reactions.

- Argon
- Fluorine
