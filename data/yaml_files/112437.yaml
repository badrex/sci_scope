revised_title: Optical Phenomena and Spectral Analysis of Opals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the optical properties of opals, discovering that they
  emit vivid flashes of color due to interference caused by minute striae or fissures
  within the gemstones. The study also reveals that opals can be used to create a
  spectrum with a black band in the red, demonstrating their potential for spectral
  analysis.
