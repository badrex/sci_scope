revised_title: On the Ultraviolet Limit of the Solar Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the ultraviolet limit of the solar spectrum and concludes
  that the absorption of radiation by the Earth's atmosphere and other factors make
  it difficult to accurately determine the limit. The author provides a detailed analysis
  of the experimental setup and observations made, highlighting the challenges and
  limitations of the study.
