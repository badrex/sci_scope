scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the reaction between bisulphide of carbon and triethylphosphine,
  resulting in a new crimson-colored compound. The substance is insoluble in water
  and ether but soluble in alcohol. It has potential applications in chemical analysis
  and detection of trace amounts of triethylphosphine.
