tldr: The Earl of Morton and Dr. Wollaston observe a hybrid offspring resulting from
  breeding a quagga male and an Arabian mare. The offspring exhibit a mix of characteristics
  from both parents, including coloration, stripes, and mane texture. This observation
  raises questions about the inheritance and hybridization of traits in animals.
