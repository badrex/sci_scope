revised_title: 'Stability and Viscosity in Fluid Motion: A Study of Annular Fluid
  Flow'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Rheology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on fluid viscosity by measuring the moment transmitted
  across the annular space between two concentric cylinders. The study examines the
  limits of stable fluid motion and the manner in which stability breaks down, providing
  insights into the behavior of fluids in annular flow.
