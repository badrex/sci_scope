  Solids
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author presents three lectures on muscular motion, discussing the elasticity
  of fluids, the immediate cause of cohesion and elasticity in solids, and the relationship
  between these properties and gravity. The lectures also explore the role of centripetal
  force in muscular motion and the importance of understanding the elasticity of various
  body parts, such as arteries and nerves.
