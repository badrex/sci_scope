revised_title: Investigating the Production of Dephlogisticated Air by Conferva Rivularis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if plants can produce dephlogisticated
  air and discovers that the water surrounding a plant, conferva rivularis, becomes
  saturated with dephlogisticated air when exposed to sunlight. The quality of the
  air produced is found to be superior in winter compared to summer.
