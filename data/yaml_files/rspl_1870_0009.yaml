scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: This article describes chemical and physiological experiments conducted on living
  Cinchona plantations. It discusses the chemical characteristics of various parts
  of the plant, the order of alkaloid formation, and the effects of solar rays on
  the contained alkaloids. The study also explores the influence of elevation and
  artificial shielding on the plant's alkaloids.
topics:
- Cinchona Alkaloids
- Plant Chemistry
- Tannates
- Alkaloid Formation
