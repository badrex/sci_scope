revised_title: Reappearance of Declination Disturbance Periods at Lisbon
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author examines magnetograph curves from the Lisbon Observatory and observes
  the reappearance of some periods of declination disturbance during two, three, or
  several days. The study suggests that the cause of these disturbances may be related
  to the sun or space and may persist for multiple days.
