revised_title: Experiments on Radiant Heat Passage through Glass Screens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author examines the passage of radiant heat through glass screens and verifies
  De la Roche's conclusion that the additional diminution of effect caused by a second
  screen is proportionally much less than the first. The author also investigates
  the interception of heat by extremely thin glass and finds no significant difference
  in the mode of transmission between thin and thick glass.
