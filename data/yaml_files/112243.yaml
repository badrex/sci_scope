revised_title: Investigations on Pedal Surfaces and Ellipsoid-Pedals
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author explores the properties and volumes of pedal surfaces, specifically
  focusing on ellipsoid-pedals. They develop formulas for calculating the volume of
  any pedal given the volume of another, and discover new properties of these surfaces,
  including the volume of the pedal of least volume and the sum of volumes of pedals
  with origins on conjugate diameters of a quadric.
