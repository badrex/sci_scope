revised_title: The Impact of Double Refraction in Lenses on Plane Polarised Light
  Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author discovers a significant source of error in their previous experiments
  involving plane polarized light due to double refraction in the lenses of their
  spectrometer. This error affects the results and may invalidate the differences
  found between the electromagnetic theory of light and experimental observations.
