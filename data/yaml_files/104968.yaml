tldr: This article describes the irregularities in the tides of the River Thames on
  February 12th and 13th, 1756. The author, Robert Dingley, and his associates observed
  two instances of the tide flowing in the opposite direction of the ebb, which they
  attribute to a combination of weak floods, yellow-colored water, and sudden wind
  shifts.
