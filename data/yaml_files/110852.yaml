revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Carbon Secretion in Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: Robert Rigg's experiments show that the amount of carbon excreted by animals
  through respiration is higher than the carbon intake from food. This suggests that
  animals create or secrete carbon internally.
