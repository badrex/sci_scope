revised_title: The Effect of Temperature on Torsional Elasticity and Internal Friction
  of Metals
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics of Materials & Properties
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the torsional elasticity
  and internal friction of various metals, finding that the torsional elasticity decreases
  and internal friction temporarily increases with rising temperature. The study also
  reveals that the change in internal friction is generally much greater than the
  change in torsional elasticity.
