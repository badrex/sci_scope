scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the yellow coloration accompanying chlorophyll and their
  spectroscopic relations. They separate and analyze the xanthophyll group using carbon
  bisulphide and find that the spectrum of these colorants varies depending on the
  plant and season. The study also reveals that the presence of acid in plant juices
  affects the xanthophylls and their spectra.
