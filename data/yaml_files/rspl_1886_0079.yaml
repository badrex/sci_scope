  Ice and Snow
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cryology & Glaciology
tldr: The author investigates the conductivity, dilatation, and hardness of pure ice
  and snow, finding that ice has a higher conductivity than snow and that its dilatation
  varies depending on the direction of measurement. The author also observes a difference
  in hardness between longitudinal and transverse measurements.
topics:
- Ice physics
- Snow properties
- Conductivity of materials
- Dilatation of materials
- Material hardness
