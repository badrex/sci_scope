revised_title: 'Investigating the Toxin-Antitoxin Reaction: Neutralization of Lysin
  by Antilysin'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The author investigates the toxin-antitoxin reaction, specifically the neutralization
  of lysin by antilysin, and finds that the haemolytic index can be used to determine
  the presence of free lysin and antilysin in mixtures that have reached equilibrium.
