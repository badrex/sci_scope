scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: In this letter, John Winthrop discusses his understanding of the aberration
  of light and its effect on the apparent position of celestial bodies, such as the
  transit of Venus. He argues that the aberration should cause the transit to appear
  later than expected, contrary to the calculations of others.
