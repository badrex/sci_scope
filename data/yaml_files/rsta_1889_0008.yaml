revised_title: Investigating the Amount of Light Reflected and Transmitted by Various
  Kinds of Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the amount of light reflected and
  transmitted by various types of glass, including crown, flint, and plate glass.
  They use photometric methods to measure the intensities of illumination produced
  by Argand gas flames and analyze the effects of glass thickness and polishing on
  reflection and transmission.
topics:
- Optical Properties of Glass
- Reflection and Transmission
- Photometry
- Glass Polishing
- Glass Refractive Index
