revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Cobalt Salts Absorption
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of cobalt salts, specifically
  cobalt chloride and cobalt bromide, using a spectroscope. The study reveals that
  the absorption spectra of these salts change when mixed with other substances, such
  as potassium chloride, and when their physical state is altered.
