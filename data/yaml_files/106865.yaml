revised_title: Observations on the Conversion of Cast Iron to Malleable Iron
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author describes the process of converting cast iron into malleable iron,
  detailing the changes in temperature, chemical reactions, and the production of
  inflammable gas during the transformation. The study provides insights into the
  role of heat generation and the conversion of charcoal into an elastic fluid during
  the process.
