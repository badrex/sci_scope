revised_title: On the Law of Heat Transmission and Accumulation in Intercepting Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author examines Dr. Herschel's experiments on solar and terrestrial rays
  that cause heat and proposes a law that accurately predicts the progression of heat
  in intercepting media. The author also presents a theory that explains the accumulation
  of heat in these media and its effects on the surrounding environment.
