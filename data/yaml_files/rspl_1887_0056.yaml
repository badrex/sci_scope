revised_title: 'Conduction of Heat in Liquids: Experimental Investigation and Conductivity
  Calculations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This research investigates the conduction of heat in various liquids, such as
  water, paraffin oil, and sulfuric acid solutions, using a unique experimental setup.
  The authors determine the conductivity of these liquids by calculating the density
  and specific heat, and they find that the conductivity of these liquids differs
  from their electrical conductivity. The study provides valuable insights into the
  relationship between heat conduction and the physical properties of liquids.
topics:
- Heat conduction
- Thermal conductivity
- Liquid conductors
- Temperature measurements
- Differential equations
