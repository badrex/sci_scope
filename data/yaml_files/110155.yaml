revised_title: A New Method for Determining the Dispersive Ratio of Glass and Computing
  Achromatic Object-Glass Radii
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Peter Barlow presents a method for determining the dispersive ratio of glass
  and computing the radii of curvature for achromatic object-glasses. He discusses
  his experimental approach, the refractive indices and dispersive ratios he determined,
  and the equations for destroying spherical aberration. Barlow also examines the
  validity of an empirical rule and explores the limits of error in spherical aberration
  and dispersion.
