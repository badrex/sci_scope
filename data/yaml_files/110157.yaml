revised_title: Investigating Secondary Deflections in Magnetized Needles by Iron Shells
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the secondary deflections in magnetized needles when
  placed in an iron shell. He distinguishes three cases and explains the phenomenon
  using the principle of induced magnetism in the shell. The results support the theory
  that the magnetism of an iron shell is induced by the action of the Earth.
