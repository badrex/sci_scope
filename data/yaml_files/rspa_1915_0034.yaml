revised_title: The Discovery of a New Series in the Helium Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors analyze the band spectrum associated with helium and discover a
  new series in the helium spectrum. They demonstrate that the series relation extends
  further than previously thought, suggesting a strong connection between line and
  band spectra.
