revised_title: Magnetic Virtue Destruction through Wire Bending
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author discovers that bending an iron wire sharply destroys its magnetic
  virtue, causing it to lose its inclination to either magnetic pole. This phenomenon
  is observed when the wire is bent and coiled, but not when it is only bent and then
  allowed to spring back into place. The author shares this observation with the Royal
  Society, hoping it may provide insight into the nature of magnetic bodies.
