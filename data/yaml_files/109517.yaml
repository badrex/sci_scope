  and Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: William Herschel investigates the properties of solar and terrestrial rays,
  discovering that they have different refrangibility and maxima. He also demonstrates
  that heat and light are not the same, as they have different transmission properties
  and can be separated through refraction.
