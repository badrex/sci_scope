  of Function of Cerebral Cortical Centres'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author investigates the restoration of co-ordinated movements after nerve-crossing
  and the interchange of function of the cerebral cortical centres. The study explores
  the possibility of nerves of different functions uniting and changing their function,
  and the impact on voluntary co-ordinated movements.
