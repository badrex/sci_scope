revised_title: Discovery of Nebulae and Luminous Spots in the Sky
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Objects & Observations
tldr: The author describes the discovery of several nebulae or luminous spots in the
  sky, which appear as bright patches when viewed through a telescope. These celestial
  objects are found among fixed stars and have no annual parallax, suggesting they
  occupy vast spaces, possibly as large as our solar system. The author speculates
  on the implications of these discoveries for naturalists and astronomers.
