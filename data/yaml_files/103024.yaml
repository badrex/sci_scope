revised_title: Experiments on the Production of Light and Heat through Attrition in
  Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments demonstrating the production of
  light and heat through the attrition of various materials in a vacuum. The experiments
  involve the use of a specialized machine to create swift motion between materials,
  such as amber on woolen and flint on steel, and show that the presence of air affects
  the intensity and type of phenomena produced.
topics:
- Attrition
- Vacuum
- Light production
- Heat production
