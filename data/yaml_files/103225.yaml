tldr: Dr. W. Sherard reports on the formation of a new island near Sant-Erini in the
  Archipelago. The island is believed to have formed due to volcanic activity, as
  evidenced by the presence of burnt rocks and pumice stones. This phenomenon is unique,
  as similar effects have not been observed in land-based volcanoes.
