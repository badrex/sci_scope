revised_title: The Detection of Tubercle Bacilli in Urine Using an Electric Current
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical reactions of certain bacteria and their
  migration in electrolytes. They develop a method to detect tubercle bacilli in urine
  using an electric current, which could potentially aid in diagnosing tuberculosis.
topics:
- Bacterial electricity
- Electrolytes
- Tuberculosis detection
- Bacterial migration
- Electrical reactions
