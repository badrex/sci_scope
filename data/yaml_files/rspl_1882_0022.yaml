revised_title: 'On the Critical Point of Mixed Gases: Investigating Gas Mixtures and
  Their Critical Points'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the critical points of mixed gases, focusing on carbonic
  and hydrochloric acid gases. They explore the behavior of these gases at different
  temperatures and pressures, providing insights into the physical chemistry of gas
  mixtures and their critical points.
topics:
- Gas Mixtures
- Critical Points
- Physical Chemistry
- Clausius and Van der Waals Equations
- Gas Behavior
