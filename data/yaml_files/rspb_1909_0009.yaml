revised_title: Selective Permeability of the Coverings of Hordeum Vulgare Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Science & Botany
tldr: The author investigates the selective permeability of the coverings of Hordeum
  Vulgare seeds, discovering that they allow water and iodine to diffuse in while
  resisting the passage of strong acids and salts. This selective permeability is
  not a function of living protoplasm and is mainly attributed to the testa derived
  from the epidermis of the nucellus.
