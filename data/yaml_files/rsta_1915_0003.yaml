revised_title: The Molecular Field in Diamagnetic Substances and its Influence on
  Magnetic Susceptibility
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular constitution and temperature
  on magnetic susceptibility in diamagnetic substances. They examine the local molecular
  field within diamagnetic crystalline media and its impact on physical properties,
  such as the transition from liquid to crystal state.
