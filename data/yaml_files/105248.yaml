scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author describes a unique red coral from the East Indies, revealing its
  tubular structure to be formed by marine polyps. The polyps breed and raise themselves
  in the coral's distinctive shape, raising new branches and extending the coral's
  structure. This discovery challenges the notion that corals are plants and highlights
  the importance of marine polyps in coral formation.
