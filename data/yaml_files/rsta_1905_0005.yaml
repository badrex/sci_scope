scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the succession of changes in radioactive bodies, focusing
  on the connection between thorium, its emanation, and the active deposit. The study
  reveals that the emanation is the parent of the active deposit, and the active deposit
  undergoes multiple changes, which are crucial in understanding the radioactive process.
