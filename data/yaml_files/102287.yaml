tldr: The author presents a comprehensive account of his observations on the Earth's
  geological formations, focusing on the presence of marine fossils in terrestrial
  strata. He argues against the prevailing theories of the time that attributed the
  presence of shells and other marine life in land to changes in sea and land levels.
  Instead, he proposes that these fossils were deposited during the Universal Deluge,
  which caused significant alterations in the Earth's surface and led to the formation
  of the current geological landscape.
