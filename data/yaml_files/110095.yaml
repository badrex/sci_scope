revised_title: 'On the Magnetism of Iron Arising from Its Rotation: A New Phenomenon'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, discovers a new phenomenon of magnetism
  in iron arising from its rotation. This phenomenon influences the directive power
  of the iron plate and affects the deviation in a compass. The author investigates
  the laws governing this action and provides a theoretical explanation for the observed
  effects.
