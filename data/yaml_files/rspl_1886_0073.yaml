revised_title: On the Lifting Power of Electromagnets and the Magnetization of Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the lifting power of electromagnets and the magnetization
  of iron, finding that the lifting power increases more slowly after reaching a certain
  point, and that the magnetic properties of iron change when exposed to strong magnetic
  forces.
