revised_title: Surface-Layer Separation of Solids in Solutions and Suspensions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the separation of solids in the surface-layers of solutions
  and suspensions, discovering that solid or highly viscous coatings spontaneously
  form on the free surfaces of proteid solutions and many non-proteid colloid solutions.
  These coatings can be heaped up to form visible solid masses, which can be separated
  out by mechanical means. The author explains this phenomenon as due to the accumulation
  of certain dissolved or suspended matters at the surfaces, which lower the surface
  tension and surface energy of the free surface of water.
