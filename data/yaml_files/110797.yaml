tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the source of electricity generated
  by the friction of water and steam against other materials. He concludes that the
  electricity is a result of the friction of water globules against the sides of the
  opening or against the substances opposed to its passage. The presence of soluble
  salts or acids in water prevents the generation of electricity, while the addition
  of oil of turpentine or olive oil causes the development of electricity of an opposite
  kind.
