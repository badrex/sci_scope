revised_title: Mayow's Theory of Respiration and Nitro-Aerial Niter
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathology
tldr: The author, A. J. Mayow, investigates the role of air in respiration and discovers
  the importance of nitro-aerial niter in the process. He also discusses the relationship
  between respiration and muscle movement, suggesting that the nitrous particles from
  the air play a crucial role in muscle contractions. Furthermore, Mayow examines
  the role of respiration in the distribution of animal spirits and the function of
  the heart, as well as the relationship between respiration and the disease rickets.
