scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author shares Dr. Alexander Garden's observations on the effects of the
  Opuntia (prickly pear) and Indigo plant on the coloring of animal juices, including
  urine and milk. Dr. Garden found that consuming prickly pears resulted in red-colored
  urine, while indigo plants dyed cow's milk blue. This research could potentially
  lead to the discovery of new dyes from these plants.
