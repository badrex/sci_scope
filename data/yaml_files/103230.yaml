revised_title: An Investigation of Air Density at Varying Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee investigates the density of air at different
  temperatures, from the greatest natural heat to the greatest natural cold in the
  climate. He uses a syphon and a thermometer to measure the air's density and finds
  that air is one-eighth more dense at 50 degrees below the freezing point compared
  to the greatest degree of natural heat.
