revised_title: Investigating the Conductivity and Vapour-Pressures of Soap Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors investigate the conductivity and vapour-pressures of soap solutions,
  concluding that soap solutions possess a high conductivity and are part of a new
  class of colloidal electrolytes. They use the dew point method to measure the rise
  of boiling point or lowering of vapour-pressures in soap solutions.
