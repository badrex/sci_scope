revised_title: The Phenomena of Parallel Bands of Light and Shade in Diamond Reflection
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Physics
tldr: Sir David Brewster examines the phenomena of parallel bands of light and shade
  in diamond reflection and concludes that they result from the reflexions of the
  edges of veins or laminse. He also discusses analogous facts observable in other
  crystals, particularly those of carbonate of lime.
