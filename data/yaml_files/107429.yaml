revised_title: A New Method for Determining a Comet's Orbit from Three Geocentric
  Observations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a new method for deducing a first approximation of a comet's
  orbit using three geocentric observations. The method simplifies the complex problem
  by assuming a small portion of the orbit as a straight line, allowing for easier
  calculations. However, the author acknowledges that the method is indeterminate
  when applied to actual data due to the earth and the comet's combined motion.
