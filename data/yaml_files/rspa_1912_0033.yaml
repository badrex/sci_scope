revised_title: Evaluation of a New Incandescent Standard of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors examine a new incandescent light standard using platinum as the
  radiating substance and a spectrophotometer for analysis. They find that the apparatus
  is accurate but not portable, has low light intensity, and requires skillful adjustments,
  making it less practical for general use.
