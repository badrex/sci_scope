revised_title: A New Approach to Kepler's Problem
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a new solution to Kepler's Problem, which involves the Equation
  of the Center and leads to an unexpectedly simple law of coefficients. This approach
  can be applied to all functions that need to be developed in series using sin or
  cos terms.
