scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the vapour-pressures of solids
  and liquids, focusing on ice and steam. They recalculated the ice-steam curve using
  a new method and found that their observations agreed more closely with this curve
  than with previous calculations. The study demonstrates the importance of the new
  method for determining the vapour-pressures of various substances.
