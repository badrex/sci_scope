revised_title: Chemical Dynamics of Photographic Development and the Microscopy of
  the Image
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical dynamics of photographic development and
  the microscopy of the image, focusing on the size and structure of silver haloid
  emulsions. They explore the effects of exposure, development, and various factors
  on the grain size and distribution, providing insights into the photographic process.
