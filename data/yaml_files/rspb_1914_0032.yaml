scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Tissue Culture
tldr: The author investigates the growth of adult mammalian tissue in autogenous and
  homogenous plasma, finding that tissue growth is more successful in homogenous plasma
  that has been kept frozen for three days. The study also shows that plasma that
  has been frozen for more than six to eight days does not support tissue growth.
