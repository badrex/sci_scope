revised_title: Developing the Disturbing Function in Physical Astronomy
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a method for developing the disturbing function in physical
  astronomy, expressing coefficients of higher-order terms in terms of lower-order
  coefficients. This method simplifies the theorems and is considered valuable for
  further research.
