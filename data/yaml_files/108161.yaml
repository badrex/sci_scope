revised_title: Determination of the Chemical Equivalents of Certain Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Atomic Weights
tldr: The author investigates the chemical equivalents of various elements, focusing
  on chlorine, and finds that the previously assumed equivalent of chlorine is slightly
  off. By conducting experiments with silver, the author determines a new equivalent
  for chlorine, which brings the atomic weight calculations closer to agreement with
  other researchers' findings.
