tldr: John Dalton examines the methods for analyzing air composition and shares his
  findings on the differences in atmospheric composition at various altitudes. He
  concludes that the proportion of oxygen to nitrogen in the atmosphere is not the
  same everywhere and decreases with altitude, but not as much as the theory of mixed
  gases would predict. The reason for this is the continuous agitation of the atmosphere
  due to winds and other factors.
