revised_title: The Criteria for Discontinuous Motion in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Gas Theory
tldr: The author investigates the conditions necessary for discontinuous motion in
  gases, considering the effects of viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation
  of surface discontinuities. The study provides a criterion to determine whether
  a given discontinuity is thermodynamically possible, based on the gas's characteristics
  and the state of the surrounding environment.
