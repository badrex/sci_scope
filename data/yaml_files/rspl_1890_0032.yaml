revised_title: Investigating the Alleged Slipping at the Boundary of a Liquid in Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Rheology
tldr: The authors investigate the alleged slipping at the boundary of a liquid in
  motion and find that there is no significant slipping effect. They also analyze
  the oscillations of a metal sphere and the friction exerted on it by the contained
  liquid, concluding that the contact theory of electromotive force is not supported
  by their findings.
