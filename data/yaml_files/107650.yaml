tldr: Edward Sabine conducted an experiment to measure the temperature at considerable
  depths in the Caribbean Sea using a self-registering thermometer. The results showed
  a significant decrease in temperature as the depth increased, with a difference
  of 37Â°F between the surface and a depth of over 1,000 fathoms.
