scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: This article discusses the alloys of steel and their properties, focusing on
  the metals that form valuable alloys for manufacturing cutting instruments. The
  authors, J. Stodart and M. Faraday, explore the processes of analysis used to determine
  the composition and perfection of these alloys, as well as the reactions between
  the alloys and acids.
