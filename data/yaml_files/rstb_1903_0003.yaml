revised_title: Pharmacological Analysis of Pyraconitine and Methylbenzacoine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Drug Discovery
tldr: The authors investigate the pharmacological effects and toxicity of pyraconitine
  and methylbenzacoine, two derivatives of aconitine, and find that they have reduced
  toxicity compared to the parent alkaloid. They also discover that the introduction
  of a methyl group in methylbenzacoine leads to a curare-like effect.
