revised_title: 'Spectrum of Oxygen: A Study of its Continuous, Compound, and Elementary
  Line Spectra'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: 'The author investigates the spectrum of oxygen using a vacuum tube and various
  experimental setups. He discovers four distinct spectra: continuous, compound line,
  elementary line, and the spectrum at the negative pole. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of gases under different conditions and helps clarify the understanding
  of double spectra.'
