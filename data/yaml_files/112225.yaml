revised_title: On the Theory of Probabilities and Ideal Events
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Probability & Statistics
tldr: George Boole investigates the analytical conditions of a method for solving
  probability problems, focusing on the use of ideal events and their connection to
  compound events. He demonstrates that the probabilities of ideal events can be determined
  when the original data supply the conditions of a possible experience, and that
  the final probability lies within the limits it would have if determined by actual
  observation.
