revised_title: Further Observations on the Diffusion of Liquids and the Comparison
  of Hydrochloric, Hydriodic, and Hydrobromic Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to investigate the diffusion of
  various liquids, focusing on hydrochloric, hydriodic, and hydrobromic acids. The
  results indicate that these acids have similar diffusibilities, despite differences
  in their physical properties such as density and boiling points. The study also
  explores the diffusion of other substances like hydrocyanic acid, acetic acid, and
  ammonia.
