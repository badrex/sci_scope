tldr: The author examines the remains of a large extinct Lama (Palauchenia magna,
  Owen) found in Quaternary deposits in the Valley of Mexico. By comparing dental
  and osteological characters, the author concludes that this extinct Cameline Ruminant
  was as large as the largest variety of living Dromedary, with closer affinities
  to the Lamas and Vicugnas.
