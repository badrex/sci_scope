revised_title: The Crystalline Structure of Metals and the Effects of Strain
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the crystalline structure of metals and alloys, focusing
  on the effects of strain on their structure. They find that metals exhibit plasticity
  while preserving their crystalline structure, challenging the distinction between
  crystalline and non-crystalline states in metals.
