revised_title: Investigating the Spectra of Electric Light and its Relation to Electrodes
  and Discharge Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author examines the spectra of electric light and how it is affected by
  the nature of electrodes and discharge media. The study aims to investigate the
  connection between spectral lines and the chemical nature of substances present
  in the discharge path, as well as to determine the role of electricity in producing
  light.
