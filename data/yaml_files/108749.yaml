revised_title: The Influence of Atmospheric Pressure on Combustion and Candle Burning
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Combustion
tldr: The author investigates the effect of atmospheric pressure on combustion, specifically
  focusing on candle burning and fuse time in shells. The experiments conducted on
  Mont Blanc and with artificial rarefaction show that the rate of combustion is independent
  of air density, and that increased pressure accelerates combustion.
