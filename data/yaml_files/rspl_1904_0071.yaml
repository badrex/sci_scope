revised_title: The Comparative Hydrolysis of Milk Sugar, Maltose, and Cane Sugar by
  Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the hydrolysis of milk sugar, maltose, and cane sugar
  using acids and find that milk sugar and maltose have different hydrolysis rates
  compared to cane sugar. They also observe that an increase in the concentration
  of the hydrolyte hastens the rate of change.
