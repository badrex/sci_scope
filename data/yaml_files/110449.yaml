revised_title: 'Theory of Light Dispersion: A Cauchy''s Undulations Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the refractive index and the length
  of light waves using Cauchy's theory of undulations. The study focuses on various
  substances, including flint glass, crown glass, water, potash solution, and turpentine,
  and concludes that the theory accurately explains the phenomena of light dispersion.
