scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: The author investigates the inheritance of color patterns in Acidalia virgularia
  moths through cross-breeding experiments. The study reveals that the speckled color
  pattern is dominant over the non-speckled pattern, supporting the theory of Mendelian
  inheritance.
