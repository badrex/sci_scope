revised_title: Electromotive Changes in the Mammalian Heart and Their Relation to
  Heartbeat
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Electrophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the electromotive changes associated with the mammalian
  heart, focusing on the spontaneous beat and the effects of injury on the heart's
  electrical activity. They find that the normal electrical variation in the heart
  is diphasic, with negativity starting at the apex and ending at the base. Injured
  hearts exhibit monophasic variations, indicating unbalanced negativity in the less
  damaged tissue.
