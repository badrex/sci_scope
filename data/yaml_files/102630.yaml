tldr: Dr. Wallis receives a letter from Leibnitz discussing a French author's upcoming
  treatise on the origins of nations, drawing from ancient mythology. Leibnitz believes
  that some valuable discoveries may be made, but also acknowledges the potential
  for partiality in the author's perspective. The letter also touches upon the connections
  between Celtic and Germanic languages, as well as the historical migrations of various
  groups.
