revised_title: The Role of Blood Fluids in Phagocytosis and Opsonic Power
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between opsonic power and phagocytosis
  in human blood, discovering that increased phagocytosis is dependent on the development
  of opsonins in blood fluids rather than modifications to white blood cells. They
  also explore the opsonic power of blood in relation to the Staphylococcus pyogenes
  and the Bacillus of Plague, demonstrating the importance of opsonins in the immune
  response to bacterial infections.
