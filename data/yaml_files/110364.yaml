revised_title: Challenging the Supposed Suction Powers of the Common Leech
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight questions the common belief that leeches have strong suction
  powers, suggesting that their blood intake is due to the impetus of blood flow from
  the bitten area and the possible introduction of a venom. He also compares this
  to the different effects of bee or wasp stings, which cause blood stagnation.
