revised_title: Spectroscopic Identity of Light Impulses and Molecular Encounters
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between light absorption and scattering,
  proposing that all terms in the equation representing disturbances are spectroscopically
  identical. This means that the impulses due to light and molecular encounters cannot
  be distinguished when white light is the source, challenging the interpretation
  of the frictional term in the equation.
