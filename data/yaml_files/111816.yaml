revised_title: Forbes' Critique on Moseley's Theory of Glacier Descent
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Geomorphology
tldr: James D. Forbes critiques Henry Moseley's theory of glacier descent, arguing
  that Moseley's explanation is insufficient and that the concept of plasticity is
  essential to understanding glacier motion. Forbes also disputes the assumption of
  a uniform daily temperature range across the glacier, which Moseley used in his
  calculations.
