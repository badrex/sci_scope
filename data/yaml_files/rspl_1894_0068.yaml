  Total Solar Eclipse of 1893

tldr: This paper discusses the results obtained with the prismatic camera during the
  total solar eclipse of April 16, 1893. The authors observed the H and K lines of
  calcium, hydrogen lines, and other spectral lines in the photographs taken during
  totality. The prismatic camera successfully captured the bright continuous spectrum
  from the inner corona and the characteristic line of the coronal spectrum (1474
  K). The study provides a preliminary insight into the potential of the prismatic
  camera for solar research.
