revised_title: The Influence of Light on Tendril Movements in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the movements of plant tendrils and their
  response to light, discovering that they recede from light sources and are attracted
  to opaque objects. This behavior suggests that plants may not have a sense of sensation
  but rather respond to external causes and organization.
