revised_title: 'Spectral Luminosity and Photometry: A Comparative Study of Dark Adaptation
  and Light Adaptation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: 'This study investigates the luminosity of the spectrum using two methods: the
  minimal effective stimulus and flicker photometry. The results show that the green
  light is the most potent in the dark-adapted eye, while the yellow is the most potent
  in the light-adapted eye. The findings suggest that the eye''s adaptation to light
  or dark conditions significantly impacts the perceived potency of different colors
  in the spectrum.'
