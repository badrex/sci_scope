revised_title: The Influence of Gravitation on the Direction of Radicle and Germination
  in Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author conducts experiments using a water-powered wheel to investigate the
  role of gravitation in the direction of radicle and germination in seeds. The results
  show that gravitation is the primary factor influencing the descent of the radicle
  and the ascent of the germination, with the radicle pointing downwards and the germination
  growing upwards.
