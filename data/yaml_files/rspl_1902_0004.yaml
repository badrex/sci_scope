revised_title: The Differential Equations of Fresnel's Polarisation-Vector in Active
  Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the differential equations of Fresnel's polarisation-vector
  in active and crystalline media, extending the theory to include magnetically active
  media. The study focuses on the boundary conditions and the propagation of oppositely
  polarized streams within these media.
topics:
- Polarization
- Fresnel's Equations
- Active Media
- Crystalline Media
- Optical Properties
