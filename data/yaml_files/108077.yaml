scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Development
tldr: The author examines the structure and development of ova in the Ornithorhynchus
  paradoxus, a monotreme, and compares it to the reproductive systems of other mammals.
  The study reveals similarities between the Ornithorhynchus and some marsupial and
  bird species, suggesting a closer relationship between these groups than previously
  thought.
