revised_title: The Effects of Strain on the Crystalline Structure of Metals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the crystalline structure of metals and the effects
  of strain on their surfaces. They observe that strained metals develop slip-bands,
  which are slips along cleavage or gliding planes in the crystals. These slip-bands
  demonstrate the persistence of crystalline structure and the relationship between
  plasticity and crystalline structure in metals.
