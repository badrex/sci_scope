  Number below 20,000
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author, William Shanks, investigates the number of figures in the period
  of the reciprocal of every prime number below 20,000, using Fermat's Little Theorem
  and other mathematical theorems. The study contributes to the understanding of prime
  numbers and primitive roots, and corrects errors in existing tables by Burckhardt
  and Desmarest.
