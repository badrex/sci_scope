tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the reaction between triethylphosphine and iodoform,
  resulting in the formation of tri-iodide of a triatomic metal and a triphosphonium
  salt. He also explores the transformation of the tri-iodide under the influence
  of silver oxide and the reactions of chloroform, bromoform, and tetratomic bodies
  with triethylphosphine.
