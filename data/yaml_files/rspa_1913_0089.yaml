revised_title: Investigating the Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the origin of thermal ionisation from carbon by purifying
  the carbon and exhaustively evacuating the surrounding vessel. They find that the
  ionisation is not directly related to electronic emission from incandescent solids,
  suggesting that chemical action or an intermediate effect by the gas in contact
  with the solid may be responsible.
