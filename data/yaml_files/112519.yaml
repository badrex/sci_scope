  Belonging to the Clinorhombic System'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of optic axes in Harmotome and Wöhlerite
  minerals and concludes that they belong to the clinorhombic system. The study involves
  examining the optical properties and crystal forms of these minerals, providing
  a more accurate crystallographic description.
