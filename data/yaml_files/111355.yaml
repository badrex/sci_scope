scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: Arthur Cayley presents new tables of symmetric functions of the roots of an
  equation up to the tenth degree, along with expressions of the powers and products
  of the coefficients in terms of these functions. He also discusses a previously
  unobserved symmetry in the tables and a theorem related to the subject.
