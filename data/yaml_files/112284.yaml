revised_title: Investigating Stellar Spectra and the Connection to Terrestrial Flames
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors, William Huggins and William Allen Miller, describe their observations
  of the spectra of some fixed stars using a newly developed apparatus. They compare
  the stellar spectra with those of terrestrial flames and find similarities, suggesting
  a connection between the two. Their findings contribute to the understanding of
  the nature of stars and their relationship to the solar spectrum.
