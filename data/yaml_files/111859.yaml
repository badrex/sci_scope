  Wiedemann'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Professor Wiedemann's research explores the magnetization and torsion of iron
  and steel when subjected to voltaic currents. The study reveals that the direction
  of the current and the magnetizing process can affect the magnetic properties of
  the materials. The findings suggest that molecular magnets play a role in these
  phenomena, influencing both the rotation and translation of the magnets within the
  material.
