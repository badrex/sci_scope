  Fermentation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the metabolic pathways of Bacillus cloacae in the fermentation
  of citric and malic acids. The author finds that the presence of oxygen significantly
  affects the fermentation process, and that the organism cannot grow on ammonium
  malate in the absence of oxygen. The study also reveals that lactic acid is not
  produced during the fermentation of either citric or malic acid by Bacillus cloacae.
