tldr: Thomas Andrews investigates the heat evolved during the mutual reaction of acids
  and bases. He concludes that the change in temperature is determined by the nature
  of the base, not the acid element of the combination. Andrews also discusses the
  influence of various factors on the experimental results and provides a supplementary
  note on the determination of the specific heat of fluids.
