revised_title: Investigations on Hem-agglutinin and Hemolysin Presence in Blood from
  Infectious and Non-Infectious Diseases
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of hem-agglutinins and hemolysins in blood
  samples from both healthy individuals and those with infectious diseases. They find
  that serum from infected patients can agglutinate and lyse red blood cells, and
  that specific agglutinins can be identified in the serum. The study provides insights
  into the immune response and potential diagnostic methods for various diseases.
