revised_title: Experimental Study of Explosion Pressures and Rates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the pressure and rate of explosions using various types
  of explosives, including solid and gaseous, and develop a recording manometer to
  measure the maximum pressure and time pressure curves. They also study the effect
  of ignition methods, explosive density, and enclosure dimensions on the explosion's
  behavior.
topics:
- Explosives
- Pressure Measurement
- Gaseous Explosions
- Solid Explosives
- Explosion Dynamics
