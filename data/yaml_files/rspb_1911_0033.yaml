scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical dynamics of serum reactions, focusing on
  the interactions between amboceptor and complement. The study demonstrates that
  these reactions follow the law of mass action and can be expressed through a mathematical
  equation. The findings provide insight into the underlying principles of serum reactions
  and the role of amboceptor and complement in these processes.
