revised_title: Experiments on Plant Growth and Air Pressure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using an air pump to study the effects of air
  pressure on plant growth and respiration. They find that plants can absorb water
  and nutrients through their roots and leaves, and that air pressure plays a crucial
  role in plant growth and health.
