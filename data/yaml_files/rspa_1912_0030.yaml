revised_title: Investigation of Electricity Emission from Carbon at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the emission of electricity from carbon at high temperatures
  and atmospheric pressure. They find that the ionization currents increase rapidly
  as the temperature rises, and discuss the factors affecting the electrification
  process, including the nature and temperature of the solid, and the surrounding
  gas pressure.
