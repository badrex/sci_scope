tldr: The author examines fossils of Belemnites and Belemnoteuthis found in the Oxford
  Clay near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and describes their unique structures and differences.
  He concludes that these fossils belong to distinct genera of naked Cephalopoda,
  with the Belemnite having a phragmocone, guard, and a calcareous capsule, while
  the Belemnoteuthis has cephalic arms and a corneo-calcareous phragmocone.
