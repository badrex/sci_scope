scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the respiration of plant leaves and discovers that they
  restore atmospheric air to its original composition by absorbing carbon dioxide
  and releasing oxygen. This process is essential for maintaining the health of the
  plant and the surrounding environment.
