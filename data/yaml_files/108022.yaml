tldr: The author documents the appearance and behavior of the Aurora Borealis on November
  18, 1835, providing detailed observations and sketches of the event. The author
  suggests that the dark cloud beneath the aurora may be a substratum of matter differing
  in nature and density from the superincumbent arch of light, and that the altitude
  of the aurora is dependent on the altitude of the dark mass beneath it.
