revised_title: Investigating Permanent Periodicity in Sunspots
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author examines the periodicity of sunspots and concludes that there is
  a permanent, unbroken period of 11 years, with the phases occurring at equidistant
  times. The study suggests that this periodicity is due to a dynamical oscillation
  within the Sun itself.
