tldr: A letter from Mr. Clark to Mr. Ludlow describes the discovery of Roman antiquities
  and ancient coins found near Devizes in Wiltshire. The artifacts include a pot containing
  numerous Roman coins, some of which were gilded with silver, and various other pottery
  items. The letter also mentions the discovery of a whitish powder, believed to be
  the ashes of human bones, which ignited when heated, suggesting it was not from
  bones but possibly a chemical substance.
