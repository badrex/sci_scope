revised_title: Investigating the Limit of Difference between Hyperbolic Arcs and Their
  Tangents
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: The author presents new theorems for computing fluents using elliptic and hyperbolic
  arcs, focusing on the limit of the difference between a hyperbolic arc and its tangent.
  This work improves upon previous theorems by Mr. Mac Laurin and Mr. D'Alembert,
  providing a more accurate method for calculating fluents in certain cases.
