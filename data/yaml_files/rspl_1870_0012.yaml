revised_title: Investigating the Approach Caused by Vibration
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author examines the phenomenon of a delicately suspended object moving towards
  a vibrating tuning fork. Through a series of experiments, the author concludes that
  the approach is not due to permanent air currents but rather a unique interaction
  between the vibrating object and the surrounding medium.
