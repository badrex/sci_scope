revised_title: Further Researches on the Dispersion of Light and Refractive Indices
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of light and the refractive indices of
  various substances, focusing on oil of cassia, sulphuret of carbon at different
  temperatures, and comparing the results with the wave theory of light. The study
  finds that Mr. KELLAND's method provides a more accurate approach to understanding
  the discrepancies between theory and experimental data.
