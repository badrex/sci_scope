revised_title: 'Trypanosomes of Domestic Animals in Nyasaland: The Morphology and
  Susceptibility of Various Animals to Trypanosoma simice'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the morphology and susceptibility of various animals
  to Trypanosoma simice, a species of trypanosome found in Nyasaland. They discover
  that the warthog is the primary host for this parasite and that it is highly virulent
  to monkeys and domestic pigs, while being harmless to other animals like oxen, antelope,
  and dogs. The study also highlights the rapid loss of virulence in T. simice when
  it passes through the blood of goats.
