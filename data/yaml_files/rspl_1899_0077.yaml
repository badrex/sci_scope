revised_title: Investigating the Magnetic Deflection of Becquerel and Röntgen Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if Becquerel and Röntgen rays are
  deflected by a magnetic field. The results show that Becquerel rays are deflected,
  but Röntgen rays are not, suggesting that they are fundamentally different in nature.
