scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author describes two electrical experiments involving the use of club-moss
  seeds and aurum fulminans. In the first experiment, seeds are set on fire using
  a metal sphere charged with electricity. In the second experiment, the discharge
  of electricity from a Leyden jar causes an explosion of aurum fulminans.
