revised_title: On the Specific Heats of Compound Gases and the Effect of Substitution
  on Their Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the specific heats of various compound gases and find
  that corresponding halogen derivatives of the same hydrocarbon have the same specific
  heat ratio. They also discover that isomers generally have the same specific heat
  ratio and that each chlorine atom added to a molecule after the first causes a decrease
  in the specific heat ratio.
