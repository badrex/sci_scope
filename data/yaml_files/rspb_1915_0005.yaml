revised_title: The Influence of Isolation and Crowding on the Production of Sexual
  Forms in Cladocera
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Reproduction
tldr: The author investigates the effects of isolation and crowding on the production
  of sexual forms in Cladocera, specifically Daphnia pulex. The study shows that isolation
  at a high temperature suppresses the production of sexual forms, while crowding
  at a lower temperature promotes their development. This suggests that an internal
  factor, rather than external conditions, influences sexual reproduction in these
  organisms.
