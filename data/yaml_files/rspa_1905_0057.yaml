tldr: The author conducts a survey of magnetic declination near the Royal Alfred Observatory
  in Mauritius, discovering three distinct foci where the declination changes rapidly.
  The true undisturbed value of the declination at the observatory remains uncertain
  due to the complex nature of the magnetic field in the area.
