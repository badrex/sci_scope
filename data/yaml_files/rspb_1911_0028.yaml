revised_title: The Influence of Arsenates and Arsenites on the Fermentation of Sugars
  by Yeast Juice
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of arsenates and arsenites on the fermentation
  of sugars by yeast juice, discovering that arsenates significantly affect fermentation,
  but in a different manner than phosphates. They also find that the whole arsenate
  remains in its original state during fermentation, and no organic combination of
  arsenic is formed.
