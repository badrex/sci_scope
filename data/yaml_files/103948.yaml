revised_title: A Water-Level Apparatus for Accurate Sea Observations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: Charles Leigh presents a water-level apparatus that can be fixed to Davis's
  Quadrant, allowing accurate sea observations even in thick and hazy weather. The
  device relies on the principle that the surface of liquids, when free from external
  causes, will be in a horizontal plane. This invention aims to prevent shipwrecks
  and loss of cargo due to inaccurate observations in unfavorable weather conditions.
