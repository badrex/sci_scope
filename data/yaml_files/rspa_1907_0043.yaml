revised_title: 'Chemical Reactions Between Salts in the Solid State: A Comparative
  Study of Lead Chloride and Potassium Iodide, and Mercuric Chloride and Potassium
  Iodide'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical reactions between solid salts, specifically
  lead chloride and potassium iodide, and mercuric chloride and potassium iodide.
  The study reveals that the reaction between mercuric chloride and potassium iodide
  occurs at a much faster rate than that between lead chloride and potassium iodide,
  with volatility being the determining factor in the speed of the reactions.
