revised_title: Observations on Ocean and Atmosphere Temperature, and Sea-Water Density
  during a Voyage to Ceylon
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Meteorology
tldr: John Davy conducted experiments on the temperature of the ocean and atmosphere
  during a voyage to Ceylon, finding that the ocean's specific gravity is nearly the
  same throughout. He also observed that the temperature of the sea is subject to
  variations and can be influenced by currents and weather conditions. Davy's findings
  have practical implications for mariners and the use of thermometers at sea.
