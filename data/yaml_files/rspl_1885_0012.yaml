revised_title: Investigation of Nile Delta Deposits and Their Mineral Composition
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Sedimentology
tldr: The author examines a series of specimens from the Nile Delta deposits obtained
  through recent boring operations. The study reveals that the deposits consist of
  varying proportions of blown sand and alluvial mud. The mineral composition of the
  sand and mud is investigated, with quartz, felspar, and other minerals being identified.
  The findings support the conclusion that the sands are desert sand derived from
  the vast tracts surrounding the Nile Valley and support previous research on the
  agencies responsible for rounding sand grains.
