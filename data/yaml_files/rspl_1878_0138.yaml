revised_title: Further Observations on the Phenomena of Electricity and Light by J.
  E. H. Gordon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: J. E. H. Gordon investigates the effects of electrostatic stress on glass and
  discovers new optical phenomena, including an orange-brown patch of light, concentric
  rings, and a large black cross on a faintly luminous background. These phenomena
  occur before the glass is perforated, and Gordon plans to further study them before
  the Royal Society.
