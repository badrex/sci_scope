revised_title: 'A Study of Spark Spectra: Structure and Linkages'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Atomic Structure
tldr: The author investigates the structure of spark spectra, focusing on silver and
  gold, and discovers that the majority of spark lines are connected through linkages,
  which are sets of lines with constant differences in wavenumbers. These linkages
  are attached to related series lines and can be represented by definite letters
  and mathematical expressions.
