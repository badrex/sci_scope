scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: This study investigates the nephridia and 'liver' of the limpet, Patella vulgata,
  examining their chemical properties and functions. The research confirms the renal
  function of the nephridia and reveals that the 'liver' functions similarly to the
  pancreas in vertebrates, with both organs playing essential roles in digestion and
  metabolism.
