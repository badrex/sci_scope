tldr: The author, R. Badcock, examines the structure and reproduction of the yew-tree's
  flower, focusing on the Farina foecundans and its unique characteristics. He observes
  the irregular shapes and actions of the Farina, which resembles gum Arabic and flower
  of brimstone, and notes that it lacks apices, stamina, and stylus, leading to the
  shedding of a large amount of pollen.
