revised_title: On the Viscosity and Chemical Nature of Esters and Ethers
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the viscosity of esters and ethers, finding that both
  groups exhibit no evidence of molecular aggregation and follow the rules of increasing
  molecular weight and isomer symmetry. They also discover that ether-oxygen has a
  distinct influence on viscosity compared to hydroxyl-oxygen and carbonyl-oxygen,
  and that formate esters have abnormally high viscosities.
