revised_title: 'Artificial Substance with Tannin Properties and Coal: A Third Series
  of Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Polymer Science
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on an artificial substance with
  tannin properties and examines its interaction with coal. The substance is created
  by digesting various resins, balsams, and gums with sulfuric acid. The tannin substance
  is found to be the same regardless of the source material, but its production varies
  depending on the duration of the digestion process. Coal is also produced as a result
  of the experiment, and the author notes that it is the only product that remains
  after the tannin substance is destroyed.
