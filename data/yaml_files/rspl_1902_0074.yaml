revised_title: On the Gravitational Instability and Stability of a Planetary System
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Astronomy
tldr: The authors explore the role of gravitational instability in the formation and
  stability of planetary systems, comparing it to rotational instability. They conclude
  that gravitational instability plays a significant role in the ejection of satellites
  and the formation of planetary systems, as observed in the solar system.

- Planetary Stability
- Gravitational Instability
- Nebular Hypothesis
- Planetary Evolution
- Solar System Formation
