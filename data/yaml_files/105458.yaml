scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author explores the nature of evaporation and solution, proposing that evaporation
  is a gradual solution of water in air. He examines the properties and effects of
  evaporation and solution, arguing that they share a common cause, and provides evidence
  for the existence of an attractive force between air and water particles.
