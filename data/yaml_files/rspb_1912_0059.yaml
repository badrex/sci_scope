revised_title: 'Enzymes of the Emulsin Type: Distribution of β-Enzymes in Plants'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of enzymes in plants, specifically
  focusing on enzymes of the emulsin type. They examine the activity of enzymes in
  various plant species and discuss the potential presence of multiple enzymes in
  some plants, such as Lotus corniculatus.
topics:
- Enzyme Action
- Emulsin Type Enzymes
- Plant Enzymes
- β-Enzymes
- Plant Distribution
