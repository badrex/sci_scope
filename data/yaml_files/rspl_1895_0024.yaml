revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Pressure on the Temperature of an Electric
  Arc Light Crater
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Energy
tldr: The author investigates the effect of surrounding gas pressure on the temperature
  of an electric arc light's crater. They find that increased pressure raises the
  temperature, while decreased pressure lowers it, suggesting that the temperature
  of the crater depends on the cooling effect of the surrounding atmosphere rather
  than the boiling point of carbon.
