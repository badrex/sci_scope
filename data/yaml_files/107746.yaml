scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the temporary magnetic effect induced in iron bodies
  by rotation. He discovers that the rotation of an iron shell causes a temporary
  deflection in a compass needle, with the deflection direction changing depending
  on the rotation direction and the position of the compass. The effect is temporary
  and disappears when the rotation stops.
