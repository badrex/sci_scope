revised_title: The Fading of Water-Colour Pigments by Ozone
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effect of ozone on water-colour pigments and finds
  that mineral colours are more stable than vegetable colours. The presence of moisture
  and oxygen is essential for the fading process, and the blue end of the spectrum
  is the main cause. The study suggests that the life of colours will be longer in
  an atmosphere free from an active oxidising agent.
