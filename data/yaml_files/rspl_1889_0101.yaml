revised_title: A New Determination of the Ratio of the Electromagnetic Unit of Electricity
  to the Electrostatic Unit
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors repeat and improve upon previous experiments to determine the ratio
  of the electromagnetic unit of electricity to the electrostatic unit. They use different
  methods and equipment to minimize errors and obtain consistent results, ultimately
  calculating a new value for the ratio.
