scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: This study investigates the principle of homotyposis, which measures the degree
  of resemblance and likeness in undifferentiated organs produced by the same individual.
  The research focuses on the vegetable kingdom and demonstrates that homotyposis
  is a fundamental natural law, with implications for heredity and variation in living
  organisms.
