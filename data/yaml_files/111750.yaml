revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Atmospheric Pressure on Ocean Levels
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Meteorology
tldr: Captain Sir James Clark Ross observes the effect of atmospheric pressure on
  ocean levels during a winter in Port Leopold. He finds that a rise in atmospheric
  pressure corresponds to a decrease in the mean level of the sea, and vice versa.
  Ross also develops a formula to determine the correct height of the tide or mean
  sea level based on these observations.
