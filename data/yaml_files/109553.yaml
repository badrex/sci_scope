revised_title: A Method of Examining Refractive and Dispersive Powers by Prismatic
  Reflection
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a method to examine refractive and dispersive powers using
  prismatic reflection, which allows for the measurement of refractive powers without
  the need for two surfaces with a known angle. This method can be applied to various
  media, including opaque bodies and the crystalline lens in animal eyes. The paper
  also discusses the dispersion of light and the relationship between refractive indices
  and dispersion.
