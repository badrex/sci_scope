revised_title: Inversion Point for Liquid Carbon Dioxide and Joule-Thomson Effect
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the Joule-Thomson effect in liquid carbon dioxide and
  discovers an inversion point at a specific temperature. This inversion point indicates
  that the liquid is behaving nearly like a perfect gas, with its volume nearly proportional
  to the absolute temperature.
