scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of electrical stimulation on the occipital
  lobe and adjacent parts of a monkey's brain, observing various eye movements and
  inclinations in response to stimulation of different zones within the brain. The
  results suggest a connection between specific brain regions and corresponding parts
  of the retina, providing insight into the organization of the visual system.
