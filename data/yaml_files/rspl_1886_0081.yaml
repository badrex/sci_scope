scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the structure and presence of the median eye in various
  lizard species, discovering that Leydig's 'frontal organ' resembles an invertebrate
  eye and is connected to the brain via a medianly placed nerve. The study provides
  insights into the evolution of the eye and its development in different species.
