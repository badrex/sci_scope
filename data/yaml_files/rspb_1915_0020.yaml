revised_title: The Effect of Surface Tension on Ferment Action
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of surface tension on the action of ferments,
  specifically invertase, on a substrate. They find that increasing surface tension
  leads to a retardation in the inversion of cane sugar by invertase when the substrate
  concentration is relatively high and the ferment concentration is low. The study
  suggests that surface tension may affect both the combination of enzyme and substrate
  and the chemical change that occurs in the enzyme-substrate compound.
