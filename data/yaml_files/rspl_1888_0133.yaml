scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the effect of occluded gases on the thermo-electric
  properties of bodies and their resistances, as well as the thermo-electric and other
  properties of graphite and carbon. The study reveals that occluded gases can significantly
  impact the thermo-electric properties of materials, with important implications
  for their practical applications.
