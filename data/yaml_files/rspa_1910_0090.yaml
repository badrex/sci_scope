revised_title: Spectroscopic Investigation of Positive Electricity Carriers from Heated
  Aluminium Phosphate
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the nature of the carriers of positive electricity from
  heated aluminium phosphate using spectroscopy. They find that the carriers are not
  atoms or molecules of hydrogen and suggest that positively charged sodium atoms
  may be the source of the positive ionization.
