revised_title: Further Observations and Experiments on the Interaction between Two
  Clocks
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the interaction between two clocks and discovers that
  the motion of one clock can significantly affect the other. The phenomenon is explained
  by the unequal pressure on the feet of the cases due to the movement of the pendulums,
  which causes a small bearing or motion in the case and communicates the motion to
  the other clock.
