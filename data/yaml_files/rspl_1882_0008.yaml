  Curve
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a short method for determining the collic of 5-pointic-contact
  with a given curve using geometrical theorems and differential equations. The method
  can also be applied to finding 14-pointic contact of a curve of the fourth order
  and other cases.
