revised_title: Separation and Analysis of Inactivation and Inhibition Phenomena in
  Precipitin Antisera
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of heat exposure on precipitin antisera,
  discovering that inactivation and inhibition are separable phenomena. They find
  that heating certain antisera to specific temperatures can render them inactive
  but not inhibitory, and vice versa. This challenges the commonly accepted relationship
  between inactivation and inhibition in precipitin antisera.
