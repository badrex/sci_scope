  and Theoretical Analysis'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the process of gas diffusion through rubber membranes,
  focusing on hydrogen diffusion. They find that the permeability of a rubber film
  is inversely proportional to its thickness and that gases act independently in a
  mixture. The results support the application of Fick's diffusion law and the assumption
  that absorption is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.
