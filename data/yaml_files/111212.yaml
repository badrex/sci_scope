revised_title: Correction of Error in the Value of the Ratio of the Circumference
  of a Circle to Its Diameter
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Numerical Analysis & Computation
tldr: The author, William Rutherford, investigates and corrects an error in the value
  of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. He extends the computation
  of the value to 440 decimal places using Machin's formula and collaborates with
  Mr. W. Shanks to verify the results.
