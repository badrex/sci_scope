tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the composition of water and the
  role of phlogiston in chemical reactions. By using pure dephlogisticated and inflammable
  air, he finds that the acid produced comes from the union of these two types of
  air, challenging the phlogiston theory and the composition of water as previously
  thought.
