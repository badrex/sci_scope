revised_title: Predicting the Path of the Comet Praedicted
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author predicts the motion and path of a comet using mathematical calculations
  and ephemerides, providing a detailed timeline of its expected trajectory and suggesting
  that further observations could help determine the comet's distance and magnitude,
  as well as potentially contribute to the debate on the motion of the Earth.
