revised_title: The Flow in Metals under Large Constant Stresses
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This research investigates the flow in metallic wires under large constant stresses,
  examining the effect of temperature on the flow's nature. The study finds that the
  flow behavior of various metals can be described by a mathematical formula, and
  that the type of flow changes with temperature, with the viscous flow becoming more
  predominant at higher temperatures.
