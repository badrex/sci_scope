revised_title: Discovery of Argon Spectrum in Low-Pressure Conditions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of argon under low-pressure conditions
  and discovers a new set of lines, which are later confirmed to belong to the argon
  spectrum. The findings contribute to the understanding of argon's properties and
  its separation from other gases.
