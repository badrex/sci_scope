revised_title: 'On the New Gases Obtained from Uraninite: Third Note'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the gases produced by heating uraninite mineral and
  examines their spectra, finding that many of the lines match those in the solar
  and stellar atmospheres. This suggests the presence of new gases that could play
  a significant role in celestial chemistry.
