tldr: This study investigates the effects of Colchicum autumnale, or Meadow Saffron,
  on gout patients. The author, Sir Everard Home, conducts experiments on both himself
  and a dog, injecting and ingesting the medicine to observe its effects on the body.
  The results suggest that the medicine acts as a specific remedy for gout by being
  absorbed into the bloodstream, supporting the idea that other medicines may also
  work through this method.
