revised_title: The Influence of Gravitation on the Form of the Thorax
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author demonstrates how the form of the thorax is influenced by gravitation
  using a simple experiment with a steel hoop. The experiment shows that the thorax
  shape changes when the gravitational force is altered, suggesting that gravitation
  plays a significant role in determining the form of the thorax in both health and
  disease.
