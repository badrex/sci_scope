revised_title: Tidal Bore Dynamics and Energy Losses
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Processes
tldr: The author investigates the dynamics of tidal bores, focusing on the energy
  losses and the role of viscosity in the process. They discuss the limitations of
  previous solutions and propose an alternative approach to better understand the
  phenomenon.
