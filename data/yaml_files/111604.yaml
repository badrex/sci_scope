revised_title: Investigation of Radiant Heat Transmission through Gaseous Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the transmission of radiant heat through various gaseous
  bodies using a specially designed tube. He discovers that gases absorb radiant heat
  to varying degrees and that different gases have different effects on different
  qualities of radiant heat.
