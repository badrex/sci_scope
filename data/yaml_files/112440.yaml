scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author discusses the results of spectrum analysis on hydrogen and nitrogen
  gases, revealing that the temperature of nebulae is lower than that of the sun and
  their tenuity is excessive. Additionally, the author presents a description and
  analysis of the dentition of Macrauchenia patachonica, a fossil ungulate from South
  America.
