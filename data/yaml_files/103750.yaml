  and Hemorrhage
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Therapeutics
tldr: Dr. Sprengell examines Dr. Eaton's Styptick and its effectiveness in stopping
  blood flow, both externally and internally. He finds that the styptick's success
  is due to the heat of the brandy used, which contracts the fibers of the blood vessels,
  rather than the styptick itself. Sprengell also raises concerns about the styptick's
  potential to cause internal hemorrhages when used without caution.
