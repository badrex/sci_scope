revised_title: Optimal Geographical Map Projection Techniques
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Cartography
tldr: The author discusses the limitations of existing geographical map projections
  and proposes a new method for creating maps that accurately represent the surface
  area and linear distances of the regions being mapped. This method involves using
  a conical surface projection and can be applied to create more accurate and useful
  maps for various purposes.
