revised_title: A New Method for Demonstrating Euclidean Geometry Propositions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a new method for demonstrating Euclidean geometry propositions
  independently, without the need for lemmas or propositions. This method is applied
  to various propositions in the first, second, fifth, and sixth books of Euclid's
  Elements, providing alternative proofs and insights into the properties of angles,
  circles, triangles, proportions, and solids.
