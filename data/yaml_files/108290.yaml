revised_title: Anatomy and Structure of Chitons
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Malacology & Molluscan Biology
tldr: The author examines the unique structure of chitons, specifically their series
  of imbricated valves, and determines that they are normal gastropods with additional,
  rudimentary valves. The study also highlights the presence of calcareous scales
  and spines on chitons, which serve as protective features and provide zoological
  characters for species distinction.
