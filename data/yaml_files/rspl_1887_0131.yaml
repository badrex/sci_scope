scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study traces the development of the pericardium, diaphragm, and great veins
  in rabbit embryos from the eighth to the seventeenth day of intrauterine life. It
  describes the splanchnic origin of the heart, the formation of the mesocardium,
  and the course of the omphalomesenteric veins to the heart. The development of a
  septum, the septum transversum, and the formation of the ventral diaphragm between
  the liver and the heart are also discussed. The study also covers the appearance
  of other somatic veins, the development of the placenta, and the closure of the
  iter venosum.
