revised_title: Investigating the Combining Properties of Serum-Complements and Complementoids
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: The authors study the combining properties of serum-complements and complementoids,
  focusing on their interactions with immune-bodies and anti-complements. They find
  that the combination of complement with anti-complement is less stable than with
  immune-body and red corpuscles, and that complementoids may play a role in these
  interactions.
