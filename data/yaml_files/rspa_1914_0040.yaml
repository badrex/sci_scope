revised_title: 'Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives: The Correlation of Crystalline
  Form with Molecular Structure'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The authors investigate the morphological characteristics of benzene derivatives
  and their crystalline forms, verifying the Barlow-Pope theory, which connects internal
  molecular structure with external form. They study the effect of various molecular
  alterations on the crystalline form and discover relationships between them.
topics:
- Benzene Derivatives
- Crystallography
- Molecular Structure
- Crystalline Form
