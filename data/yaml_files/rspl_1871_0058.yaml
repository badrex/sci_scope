revised_title: Exploring the Connection between Coal Mine Explosions and Meteorological
  Conditions
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The authors investigate the connection between coal mine explosions and weather
  conditions, specifically focusing on barometric pressure and temperature. They analyze
  historical data and find that the number of fatal accidents has decreased over time,
  but the number of serious accidents involving multiple fatalities has increased.
  The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these connections to improve
  coal mine safety.
