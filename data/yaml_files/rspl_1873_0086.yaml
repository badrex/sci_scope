tldr: This article presents the preliminary results of magnetic observations conducted
  at Zi-Ka-Wei Observatory in China. The observations were made using self-recording
  magnetographs, and the data includes the declination, vertical intensity, inclination,
  horizontal intensity, and total intensity of the magnetic field. The authors express
  hope that this new establishment will significantly advance the study of terrestrial
  magnetism.
