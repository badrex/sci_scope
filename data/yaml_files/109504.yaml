revised_title: Peculiarities in the Distribution of Arteries in Slow-Moving Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, observes a peculiarity in the distribution of
  arteries in slow-moving animals like the Lemur tardigradus and Bradypus tridactylus.
  The arteries in their limbs are divided into numerous equal-sized cylinders, which
  distribute blood to the muscles. This unique configuration may contribute to the
  animals' sluggishness and is also observed in some other animals, such as the lion
  and ruminating animals.
