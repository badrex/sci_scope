revised_title: A New Approach to the Mathematical Theory of Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author presents a new mathematical theory of magnetism, free from the hypothesis
  of two magnetic fluids, and based on Coulomb's experimental researches and known
  facts. The theory covers general magnet properties, magnetic induction, and various
  magnetic distributions, with further research planned for future communications.
