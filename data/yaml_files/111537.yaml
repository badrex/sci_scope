revised_title: 'Involuntary Muscular Tissue of the Urinary Bladder: A Comparative
  Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, George Viner Ellis, investigates the involuntary muscular tissue
  of the urinary bladder and compares it to voluntary muscle in other parts of the
  human body. He refutes Prof. Kolliker's view that involuntary muscle is made up
  of fusiform cells, instead arguing that it is composed of lengthened fibers with
  fixed and tendinous terminal attachments. He also distinguishes between oval and
  fusiform corpuscles within the muscular tissue.
