revised_title: Experimental Determination of Velocities of Normal Propagation in Biaxal
  Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Crystal Physics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the velocities of normal propagation
  of plane waves in different directions within a biaxal crystal, comparing their
  results with Fresnel's theory of double refraction.
topics:
- Crystal Optics
- Wave Propagation
- Refraction
- Crystallography
- Fresnel's Theory
