revised_title: 'Involuntary Muscular Tissue of the Urinary Bladder: A New Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author challenges the widely accepted notion of elongated contractile fiber-cells
  in the involuntary muscular tissue of the urinary bladder, proposing instead that
  the muscular wall is composed of lengthened fibers with fixed and tendinous end-attachments.
  This theory is supported by the arrangement, structure, and characteristics of the
  fibers in both voluntary and involuntary muscles.
