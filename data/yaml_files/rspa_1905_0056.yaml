scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Water Resources
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between pressure and rainfall changes
  and the flow of the River Thames. The authors analyze historical data from 1883
  to 1903, finding a close association between rainfall and pressure, and a lag in
  the river's response to rainfall. The findings contribute to understanding the impact
  of weather changes on river flow and flood risk.
