revised_title: 'On the Attractions of Homogeneous Ellipsoids: A Simplified Approach'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Physics & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents a simplified method for determining the attractions of ellipsoids,
  focusing on homogeneous bodies with finite surfaces of the second order. The approach
  involves decomposing direct attractions into forces acting parallel to fixed axes
  and integrating these expressions to obtain the final attractive forces.
