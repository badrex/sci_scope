revised_title: Investigating the Suspension of Quick Silver in the Torricellian Experiment
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: Dr. John Wallis investigates the suspension of quicksilver in the Torricellian
  experiment and discusses the role of air pressure in the phenomenon. He suggests
  that the pressure of the air, both grosser and purer, plays a significant part in
  the height at which the quicksilver remains suspended.
