revised_title: Microscopic Analysis of Devitrified Glass and Analogous Structures
  in Rocks
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Petrology
tldr: This paper examines the microscopic changes in glass samples exposed to high
  temperatures, focusing on the crystallization process and its relation to natural
  devitrification in rocks. The authors compare artificial devitrification to natural
  phenomena, discussing the development of crystalline structures and the role of
  chemical composition in the process.
