revised_title: Physiological Action of Chinoline and Pyridine Bases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Pharmacology
tldr: The authors investigate the physiological effects of various chinoline and pyridine
  bases on animals, finding that they primarily affect nerve centers, leading to drowsiness,
  anesthesia, and respiratory and circulatory system weakening. They also observe
  that the bases' effects are similar regardless of their source, either from cinchonine
  or tar.
