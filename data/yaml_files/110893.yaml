tldr: Thomas S. Beck's study examines the nerves of the uterus in both unimpregnated
  and gravid states, investigating their changes during pregnancy. He concludes that
  the nerves undergo minimal changes in size or position, only adapting to the organ's
  enlargement. He also speculates that uterine vessels may not decrease in size after
  childbirth but become contracted within their cavity.
