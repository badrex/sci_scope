revised_title: Investigations of Vapour-Pressures of Solids and Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids,
  specifically ice, camphor, benzene, acetic acid, and water. They find that the vapour-pressure
  of a solid is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and that these
  differences can be calculated from thermic data. The author also introduces a new
  method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids.
