tldr: In this series of experiments, Faraday investigates the relationship between
  the magnetic force of the earth and the deflection of a galvanometer. He demonstrates
  that the amount of deflection is proportional to the number of lines of force intersected
  by the moving wire, and explores the effects of wire thickness and area on the deflection.
  Faraday also examines the influence of magnets on each other's force and the coalescence
  of their lines of force.
