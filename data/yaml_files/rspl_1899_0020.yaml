revised_title: On a Self-Recovering Coherer and the Study of Cohering Action of Different
  Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the cohering action of various metals and develops a
  self-recovering coherer that can be used to study the effects of electric radiation
  on different materials. The coherer's sensitivity is tested with metals such as
  potassium, sodium, lithium, and alkaline earth metals, revealing unique responses
  to electric waves and the potential for automatic recovery.
