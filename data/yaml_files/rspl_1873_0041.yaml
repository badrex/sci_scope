revised_title: 'On the Annual Variation of the Magnetic Declination: A Comparative
  Study of Two Instruments'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author presents a comparative study of two magnetometers at Trevandrum,
  analyzing the annual variation of the magnetic declination and confirming the existence
  of an annual law affecting the magnetic needle. The study reveals a double oscillation
  with distinct maxima and minima occurring around specific times of the year.
