revised_title: A New Approach to the Theory of Parallels
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author proposes a new method to prove the Theory of Parallels by using the
  Platonic property of the sphere. By placing two equal circles in the same plane
  and allowing them to dilate while maintaining the equality of their diameters, the
  author believes that the Theory of Parallels can be established without relying
  on the axiom of the straight line.
