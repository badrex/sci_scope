revised_title: 'Atmospheric Electricity in High Latitudes: Observations and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: This study investigates atmospheric electricity in high latitudes, focusing
  on the potential gradient, dissipation, ionization, and meteorological conditions.
  The results show a yearly and daily variation in these factors, with the potential
  gradient and dissipation being influenced by ionization. The study also finds a
  connection between radioactivity and meteorological conditions, supporting the theory
  that soil is the source of radio-active emanation in the atmosphere.
topics:
- Atmospheric electricity
- Ionization
- Dissipation
- Potential gradient
- Meteorological conditions
