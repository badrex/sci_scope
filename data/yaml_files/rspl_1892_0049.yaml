scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the properties and composition of ternary alloys containing
  aluminium, lead, tin, and silver. The experiments reveal that aluminium causes the
  curve of the alloys to lie outside of its former position, and that the formation
  of atomic compounds between specific metals influences the mutual relations of the
  alloy components.
