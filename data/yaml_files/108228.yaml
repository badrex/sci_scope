revised_title: 'Chemical Analysis of Resins: Sagapenum, Galbanum, and Euphorbium'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: 'The author analyzes the chemical composition of three resins: sagapenum, galbanum,
  and euphorbium. They provide detailed analysis of their properties, including their
  solubility, ash content, and elemental composition. The author suggests that resins
  may be composed of multiple compound radicals and that further research is needed
  to understand their constitution.'
