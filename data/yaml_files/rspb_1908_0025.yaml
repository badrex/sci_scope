tldr: The author, David Fraser Harris, discusses the phenomenon of post-tetanic tremor
  in muscles and its relation to previous research on similar tremors in lobsters
  and crayfish. He acknowledges the work of Dr. Sydney Binger and Professor C. Bichet,
  who also observed identical tremors in their respective studies.
