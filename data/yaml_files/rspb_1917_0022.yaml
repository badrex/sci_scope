scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: The author examines two cases of congenital night-blindness and investigates
  the differences in color perception and light sensitivity between night-blind and
  normal vision. The study reveals that night-blind individuals have an absence of
  sensitive rods in their retina, which affects their ability to see in low light
  conditions.
