revised_title: Experiments on Land Carriage Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Transportation
tldr: The author, Sir William Petty, proposes a series of experiments to compare the
  efficiency and capabilities of various land carriages, including carts, wagons,
  and horse-drawn vehicles. The experiments aim to determine factors such as load
  capacity, speed, and the effects of different wheel designs and materials on the
  overall performance of these carriages.
