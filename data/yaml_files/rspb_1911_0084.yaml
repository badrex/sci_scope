  Mixtures on Rabbits
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of injecting rabbits with protein-free tuberculo-antigen
  and antigen-serum mixtures, finding that these injections can produce complement-fixation
  bodies. They also discover that digestion of the alcohol-ether extract with rabbit
  serum inhibits the production of specific sensitisers.
