revised_title: Investigating Perturbations of the Leonids
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the perturbations of the Leonids meteor shower, focusing
  on the ortho-stream and its orbit. They compute the actual perturbations of a specific
  part of the stream over one revolution, taking into account the influence of Mars,
  Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Their findings provide a better understanding of the
  meteor shower's behavior and help improve future predictions of its occurrence.
