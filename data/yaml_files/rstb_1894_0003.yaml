  in the Monkey
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the motor region of the cortex cerebri in the monkey,
  specifically the facial area, and provide a detailed analysis of the movements observed
  through electric stimulation. They identify the representation of facial movements
  and confirm the findings of previous researchers in the field.
