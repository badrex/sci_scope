revised_title: On the Determination of the Photometric Intensity of the Coronal Light
  During the Solar Eclipse of April 16th, 1893
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astronomy
tldr: 'The authors describe their methods for measuring the photometric intensity
  of the coronal light during the solar eclipse of April 16th, 1893, using two instruments:
  the equatorial photometer and the integrating photometer. They compare the brightness
  of the corona at different distances from the moon''s limb and measure the total
  brightness of the corona, excluding the sky effect.'
