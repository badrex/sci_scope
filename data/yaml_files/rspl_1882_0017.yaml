scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: The author describes the construction and testing of a deep-sea electrical thermometer,
  which measures temperature changes in deep-sea environments. The device uses a wire
  coil submerged in water and connected to a Wheatstone bridge. The results show that
  the instrument can accurately measure temperature differences in various depths,
  providing valuable data for marine research.
