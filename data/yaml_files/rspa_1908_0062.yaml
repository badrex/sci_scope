revised_title: The Optical Constants of Gypsum and the Mitscherlich Experiment
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the optical constants of gypsum and its unique behavior
  in the Mitscherlich experiment, where the crystal's optic axes change position under
  the influence of heat. The experiment demonstrates crossed-axial-plane dispersion,
  a phenomenon rarely exhibited by crystals, and provides insight into the properties
  of gypsum and other materials.
