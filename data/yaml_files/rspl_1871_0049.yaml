revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Planetary Positions on Solar Activity
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Activity
tldr: The authors investigate the potential influence of planetary positions on solar
  activity, specifically focusing on the behavior of sunspots as they cross the sun's
  visible disk. They analyze data from two series of sunspot observations, concluding
  that there may be a connection between planetary positions and sunspot behavior.
