revised_title: An Investigation into the Apex of the Leaf in Osmunda and Todea
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the apex of the leaf in Osmunda and Todea species and discovers
  a three-sided, conical apical cell, differing from the typical two-sided cell found
  in other ferns. This finding suggests an intermediate developmental stage between
  ferns and other plant groups, such as Marathacece and Cycadece.
