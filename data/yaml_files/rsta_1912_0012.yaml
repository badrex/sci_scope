revised_title: The Kinetic Theory of a Gas with Spherically Symmetrical Molecules
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors develop a kinetic theory for a gas composed of spherically symmetrical
  molecules, deriving expressions for viscosity, diffusivity, and conductivity without
  assuming any specific properties of the molecules other than their symmetry. They
  also discuss the effects of molecular encounters and interactions on the gas's behavior.
