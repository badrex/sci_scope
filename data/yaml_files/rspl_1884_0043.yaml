revised_title: Investigating the Relationship Between the Mean Diurnal Inequality
  of Earth's Magnetic Force and the Sun-spot Period at Bombay

tldr: This paper examines the variations in the mean diurnal inequality of the horizontal
  component of Earth's magnetic force at Bombay and their relationship to the sun-spot
  period. The author analyzes over 265,000 hourly observations from 1846 to 1880 and
  finds that the mean diurnal inequality is subject to an eleven-yearly period, an
  annual variation, and a variation with a duration of over thirty-three years. The
  study supports the idea that magnetic observations can indicate variations in solar
  heat more quickly and accurately than other indirect observations.
