scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryology
tldr: The author discusses the interior melting of ice and its physical properties,
  including the effects of pressure on ice and the blue veins in glaciers. He explains
  that the oscillations in the melting point of ice are consequences of varying pressures
  experienced by different portions of the ice mass.
