revised_title: The Influence of Nitrous Acid on the Reaction between Copper and Nitric
  Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the conditions necessary for a reaction to occur between
  metallic copper and nitric acid. They find that the presence of nitrous acid significantly
  affects the reaction rate and that the formation of nitrous acid occurs rapidly
  after the reaction begins. The author also demonstrates that urea can be used to
  remove nitrous acid from the reaction mixture.
