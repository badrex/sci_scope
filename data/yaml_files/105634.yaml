tldr: Matthew Raper defends the authenticity of Norwood's measure of a degree, arguing
  that it predates Picard's measure and was known to Sir Isaac Newton. Raper refutes
  the claim that Newton never heard of Norwood's measure, providing context on the
  historical use of measurements in navigation and astronomy.
