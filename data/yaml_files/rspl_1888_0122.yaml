scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Zoology
tldr: The author investigates the cranial nerves of Elasmobranch fishes, specifically
  Lcemargus and Baia, and discovers significant differences in their anatomy compared
  to previously studied forms. This research challenges existing understanding of
  the segmental value and modifications of cranial nerves in vertebrates.
