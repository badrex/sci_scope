revised_title: The Role of Acidity and Alkalinity in Stomach Immunity
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology & Digestive System
tldr: The author investigates the immunity of the stomach from being digested by its
  own secretion during life. They propose that the balance between acidity and alkalinity
  in the stomach and blood provides protection from self-digestion. Experiments show
  that when this balance is disrupted, the stomach can be digested by its own secretion.
