revised_title: Explaining the Effect of Wind on Sound Refraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: The author investigates the effect of wind on sound refraction and explains
  that the variation in wind velocity near the ground causes sound waves to tip up
  and proceed in an upward direction, resulting in diminished sound transmission against
  the wind.
