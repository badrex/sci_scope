revised_title: The Diuretic Action of Digitalis and Its Influence on Blood Pressure
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Therapeutics
tldr: This study investigates the diuretic action of Digitalis and its effects on
  blood pressure. The authors find that Digitalis stimulates vaso-motor nerves, causing
  a moderate contraction of systemic vessels and raising blood pressure. However,
  it also affects renal vessels more powerfully, leading to a temporary halt in urine
  secretion. As the drug's action on systemic vessels subsides, blood pressure falls,
  and renal arteries dilate, potentially increasing blood pressure in the renal glomeruli.
