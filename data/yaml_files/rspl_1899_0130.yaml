revised_title: Influence of Liquid Hydrogen Temperature on Bacteria Vitality
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of liquid hydrogen temperature (-252Â°C) on
  the vitality of various bacteria species. They expose the bacteria to this extreme
  temperature for ten hours and find no appreciable effect on their appearance or
  growth vigor. This suggests that extremely low temperatures do not significantly
  impact bacterial vitality.
