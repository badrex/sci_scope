scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This study investigates the influence of the moon on temperature by analyzing
  a series of thermometric observations for fifty years. The results confirm a lunar
  influence on temperature, with maximum mean temperatures occurring in the first
  half of the lunation and minimum mean temperatures in the second half. The phenomenon
  is attributed to a maximum of cloud, rain, and vapor-bearing winds in the first
  half of the lunation, and a minimum of cloud and rain with drier winds in the second
  half.
