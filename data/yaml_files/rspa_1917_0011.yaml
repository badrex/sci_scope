revised_title: A Determination of the Heat of Vaporisation of Water at 100°C and One
  Atmosphere Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The author measures the heat of vaporization of water at 100°C and one atmosphere
  pressure using a steam calorimeter, providing a more accurate determination of this
  value in terms of the mean calorie.
topics:
- Heat of vaporisation
- Steam calorimeter
- Latent heat
- Thermal properties of water
- Calorimetry
