tldr: James D. Forbes conducts an experiment during the annular eclipse of May 15,
  1836, to determine if the sun's atmosphere is responsible for the dark lines in
  the solar spectrum. The results show no differences in the spectrum when light comes
  from different parts of the solar disc, proving that the sun's atmosphere is not
  involved in the production of these dark lines.
