revised_title: Excitation of β-Rays by the α-Rays of Ionium and Radiothorium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear Physics & Radioactivity
tldr: The authors investigate the excitation of β-rays by α-rays in ionium and radiothorium.
  They find that the ionization due to β-rays is 10 times greater than the ionization
  due to α-rays, suggesting that the β-rays are excited by the α-rays themselves or
  by the surrounding thorium atoms.
