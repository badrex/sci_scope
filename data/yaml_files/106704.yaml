scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the magnetism of brass and platina, discovering
  that most brass and platina samples exhibit some degree of magnetism when tested
  using a unique suspension method and quicksilver. The author also discusses the
  importance of using clean, pure quicksilver and the effects of exposure to the atmosphere
  on the experiment's results.
