scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the terms in the disturbing function of the fourth order,
  focusing on eccentricities and inclinations, and their impact on secular inequalities
  in planetary motion. He presents a method to calculate these terms and applies it
  to an example involving the inequality of Venus.
