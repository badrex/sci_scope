revised_title: 'Thermo-electric Properties of Salt Solutions: A Study on the Effect
  of Salt Concentration on Thermoelectricity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the thermo-electric properties of salt solutions and
  discovers that the presence of a salt in solution can increase or decrease the value
  of thermo-electricity depending on the nature of the salt. The study also shows
  that the effect is not entirely additive, and the differences in thermo-electricity
  between salts can be superposed on the water itself.
