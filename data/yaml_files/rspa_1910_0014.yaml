revised_title: A Novel Method for Determining the Viscosity of Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors develop a method to determine the viscosity of gases, particularly
  those available in small quantities, using a capillary tube and a mercury pellet.
  They demonstrate the method's effectiveness with neon, xenon, and krypton, and discuss
  its potential for further applications with rare gases.
topics:
- Gas Viscosity
- Capillary Tube
- Mercury Pellet
- Temperature Variation
- Rare Gases
