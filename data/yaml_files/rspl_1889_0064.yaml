revised_title: Comparing the Spectra of Nebulae and Stars with Comets and Aurorae
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author compares the spectra of nebulae and stars with those of comets and
  aurorae, finding many similarities and differences in the lines and flutings present
  in each. The study strengthens the hypothesis that comets, nebulae, stars, and aurorae
  may have a common origin, independent of their chemical origins.
