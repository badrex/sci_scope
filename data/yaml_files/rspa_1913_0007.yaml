revised_title: The Photoelectric Behavior of Iron in Active and Passive States
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the photoelectric activity of iron in both active and
  passive states, finding that active iron exhibits higher photoelectric activity
  than passive iron. This research sheds light on the nature of passivity and its
  effects on the photoelectric properties of iron.
