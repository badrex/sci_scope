scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author introduces a new method in analysis that expands the calculus of
  operations, allowing for the solution of linear differential equations with variable
  coefficients and the classification of integrable forms. This method offers advantages
  in the theory of series, generating functions, and equations of finite differences.
