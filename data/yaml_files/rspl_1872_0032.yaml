revised_title: Chemical and Microscopical Examination of Salt Spring Waters and Rocks
  in Huel Seton Mine
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrogeology & Geochemistry
tldr: This article examines the composition and origin of the waters of a salt spring
  in Huel Seton Mine, Cornwall, and analyzes the surrounding rocks. The water is found
  to have a temperature of 92Â°F and a specific gravity of 1.0123. The analysis reveals
  various chemical components, including carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, silica, chlorine,
  and more. The author suggests that the salt spring may be the result of infiltration
  of seawater through faults or channels, and that the water may have undergone chemical
  reactions with the surrounding rocks.
