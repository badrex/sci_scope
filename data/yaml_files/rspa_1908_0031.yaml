revised_title: Effects of Self-Induction in an Iron Cylinder Traversed by Alternating
  Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the effects of self-induction in an iron cylinder when
  traversed by alternating currents. The study explores the relationship between periodic
  time, total current, and the magnetic induction, as well as the energy dissipated
  by electric current overcoming resistance and magnetic hysteresis.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Alternating Currents
- Magnetic Hysteresis
- Sel
