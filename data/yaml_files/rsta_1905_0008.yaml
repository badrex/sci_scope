revised_title: On the Refractive Indices of the Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the refractive indices of various elements, particularly
  focusing on the inert gases and halogens, and finds a simple numerical relationship
  between their refractivities. This relationship suggests that refractivity is a
  complex function of atomic weight, valency, and other properties of matter.
