revised_title: Experiments on Stratification in Electrical Discharges through Rarefied
  Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the effects of different contact-breakers and vibrations
  on stratification in electrical discharges through rarefied gases. The study reveals
  that a steady and regular contact-breaker can produce soft, rounded, and equidistant
  striae, while irregular contact-breakers result in sharp, flaky, and irregularly
  distributed striae.
