tldr: Wilfred Rowell, H.B.M. Consul in Samoa, reports the discovery of a new volcanic
  island formed by a submarine volcano in the Pacific Ocean, near the Friendly Group.
  The island is approximately two miles long, 200 feet high, and has reefs on its
  northern and southern extremities. The exact depth of the eruption is unknown due
  to limited hydrographical knowledge of the area.
