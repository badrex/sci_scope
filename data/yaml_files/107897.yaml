revised_title: On the Polarization of Light by Transparent Plates
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the action of the second surfaces of transparent plates
  on light and finds that the quantity of polarized light contained in the transmitted
  pencil is equal to the quantity of light polarized at right angles in the reflected
  pencil. This phenomenon occurs at all angles of incidence, with the exception of
  the maximum polarizing angle, where the plate completely polarizes the light in
  the plane of reflection.
