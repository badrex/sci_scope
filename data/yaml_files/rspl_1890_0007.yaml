revised_title: 'Experiments on Vapour-Density: Investigating Bromine Dissociation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the tendency of bromine to dissociate at low pressures
  and moderate temperatures. Using a modified Dumas method, the experiments show no
  significant dissociation, even at low pressures, suggesting that bromine does not
  have a strong tendency to dissociate under these conditions.
