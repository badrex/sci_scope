revised_title: A New Manometer for Measuring Low Pressures in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Measurement Techniques
tldr: The author presents a new manometer design for measuring low gas pressures,
  overcoming challenges in accurately measuring pressure differences at low levels.
  The manometer uses a glass fork with two bulbs connected by a flexible tube, allowing
  for precise adjustments and readings. This innovative design enables more accurate
  measurements of pressure differences in gases, particularly at low pressures.
