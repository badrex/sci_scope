scientific_subdiscipline: Urology & Nephrology
tldr: The author examines the composition of urinary calculi through a systematic
  microscopic analysis, discovering that globular urates and oxalates of lime are
  common ingredients in their formation. The study also highlights the influence of
  physical factors on the crystallization process and the unique structures formed
  by these salts within the calculi.
