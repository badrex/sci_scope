revised_title: Electrical Phenomena in Salivary Gland Secretion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical phenomena accompanying the secretion
  process in the salivary glands of dogs and cats. They find that the process is accompanied
  by definite electrical changes, and that the nature of these changes varies depending
  on the type of nerve stimulation and the accompanying secretion.
