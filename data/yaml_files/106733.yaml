revised_title: An Investigation of Heat Production in Different Materials
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to determine if an equal application of heat
  to different materials will produce the same amount of heat. He uses two identical
  apparatuses, one with a pasteboard diaphragm and the other with an iron diaphragm,
  to test the effect of the sun's rays on the materials. The results show that the
  iron diaphragm generates more heat than the pasteboard diaphragm, indicating that
  the efficiency of heat production depends on the material.
