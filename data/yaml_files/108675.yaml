scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: The author investigates the development of decapod crustaceans, focusing on
  the progression from the zoea larval form to the adult stage. They argue that the
  transformation is gradual and not a sudden metamorphosis, with each part undergoing
  a transformation. The study uses Carcinus maenas as the primary species and provides
  detailed analysis of the embryonic development, anatomy, and function of various
  body parts.
