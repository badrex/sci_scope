scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cancer Research & Oncology
tldr: This study examines the susceptibility and immunity of rats to Jensen's Rat
  Sarcoma, observing four types of tumor growth and the effects of radiation exposure
  on immunity. The researchers find that rats can develop immunity to the sarcoma
  through exposure to radiation, suggesting potential applications in cancer treatment.
