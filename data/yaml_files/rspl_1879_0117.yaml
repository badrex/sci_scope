revised_title: 'Magnetic Circuits in Dynamo- and Magneto-Electric Machines: Effects
  of Tension and Pressure on Electromagnets'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of tension and pressure on electromagnets
  and their closed magnetic circuits. They discover that tension strengthens the magnetization,
  while pressure weakens it. The study also reveals that the attractive force of electromagnets
  in closed magnetic circuits can increase with time.
