revised_title: The Influence of Stress and Strain on the Magnetic Induction of Iron,
  Nickel, and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author presents the results of experiments conducted over ten years on the
  effects of stress and strain on the magnetic permeabilities of iron, nickel, and
  cobalt. The study explores the relationship between magnetic permeability and stress
  and strain at various temperatures, revealing key findings on the influence of loading
  on temporary and permanent permeabilities.
