scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author presents a new method for investigating the microstructure of metals,
  focusing on slip-bands in metallic fractures. The method involves electro-depositing
  a layer of copper onto the metal specimen, cutting the specimen transversely, and
  polishing the section using a modified technique. The results reveal clear steps
  or serrations in the boundary line, which are believed to be sections of slip-bands.
