revised_title: 'The Motion of a Stream of Finite Depth Past a Body: Free and Channel
  Boundaries'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerodynamics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a fluid stream of finite depth past an
  immersed body, considering both free and channel boundaries. The study focuses on
  the forces acting on the body and the behavior of the fluid around it, providing
  insights into the design of streamlined shapes and the understanding of boundary
  layers.
