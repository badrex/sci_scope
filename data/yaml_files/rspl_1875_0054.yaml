revised_title: A New Method for Measuring the Mean Refractive Index of Glass and Lenses
  Using Newton's Rings
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: 'The author presents a new refractometer that measures the mean refractive index
  of glass plates and lenses using Newton''s rings. The instrument relies on two principles:
  the displacement of an image due to refraction through a plate and the exquisite
  contact between films of Newton''s rings and the central spot. This method allows
  for accurate measurement of the refractive index with a precision of up to the hundredth
  of an inch.'
