tldr: This study investigates the development of the thymus, epithelial bodies, and
  thyroid in the marsupial Trichosurus vulpecula. The research reveals that the marsupial
  has a more primitive thymus development compared to other mammals, with two pairs
  of thoracic thymus glands derived from the entoderm of the third and fourth gill-pouches.
