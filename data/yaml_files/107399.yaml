tldr: John Pond observes the winter solstice of 1812 using the mural circle at Greenwich
  and discusses the importance of using circumpolar stars to deduce refractions. He
  also suggests that a slight modification of Bradley's refractions might be necessary
  for a better understanding of the solstices.
