tldr: The author investigates the structure of the cerebral cortex in the Pig, Sheep,
  and Cat, focusing on the regional distribution of ganglionic cells and the arrangement
  of cortical layers. The study reveals similarities and differences in the structure
  of the cortex among these animals, providing insights into the comparative anatomy
  of the brain.
