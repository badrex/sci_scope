scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The study investigates the elasticity of the living brain and the conditions
  affecting its recovery after compression. The research was conducted on dogs, and
  the findings suggest that the elasticity of the brain is not perfect, and the recovery
  depends on various factors, including vascular and respiratory systems.
