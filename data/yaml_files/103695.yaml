tldr: The author discusses the nature and formation of aneurysms, debating whether
  they are caused by arterial dilation or a rupture of the internal and external coats
  of the artery. The author concludes that aneurysms are tumors formed by blood forcing
  through the ligamentous coat and distending the membranous outer coat, resulting
  in a pulsatile dilatation rather than a pulsation.
