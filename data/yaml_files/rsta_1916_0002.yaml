revised_title: The Electrical Conductivity and Luminosity of Flames Containing Salt
  Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the electrical conductivity and luminosity of flames
  containing salt vapors, finding that the presence of alkali salt vapor increases
  both the luminosity and electrical conductivity of the flame. The study examines
  the motion of luminous salt vapor in flames due to an electric field, the velocity
  of positive ions, and the relationship between luminosity and conductivity.
