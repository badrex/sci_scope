revised_title: Computation of Light Wave Lengths in Kirchhoff's Dispersion-Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: George Biddell Airy computes the lengths of light waves corresponding to the
  lines in Kirchhoff's dispersion spectrum, providing a valuable tool for further
  physical inquiry and comparison with direct measures of wave lengths by Angstr√∂m
  and Ditscheiner.
