tldr: Captain G. S. Nares and Admiral Richards investigated the currents in the Strait
  of Gibraltar in August 1871. They found that the movement of water in the strait
  was tidal and affected by a surface current running into the Mediterranean from
  the Atlantic. The ebb-tide sets to the eastward, while the flood-tide runs to the
  westward. Their observations may be useful for vessels navigating the Mediterranean
  trade.
