tldr: The author investigates the correlation between external parts of the Palaemon
  serratus, a common prawn, by measuring 1000 adult female prawns and analyzing the
  degree of correlation between various organs and body parts. The study reveals the
  highest degree of correlation between paired organs, such as the right and left
  squames and exopodites, and between the terga of adjacent abdominal segments.
