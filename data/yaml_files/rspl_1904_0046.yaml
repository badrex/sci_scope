tldr: The authors present a new method for preventing death from snake bites using
  permanganate of potash. They describe the design of an instrument that combines
  a lancet and a container for the permanganate, making it easy to apply the antidote
  to snake bite wounds. Experiments show that the permanganate is effective against
  various types of snake venom, rendering them inert and potentially saving lives.
