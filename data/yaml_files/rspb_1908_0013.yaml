revised_title: Localization of Motor Function in the Lemur's Brain
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study investigates the localization of motor function in the lemur's brain
  through stimulation and extirpation experiments. The results show that the motor
  centers are similar to those found in higher primates, with distinct areas controlling
  the lower limb, upper limb, and head regions. The study also highlights the large
  size of the hand and finger area, which is consistent with the lemur's arboreal
  lifestyle and the use of its hands in climbing.
