revised_title: Theoretical Analysis of Boomerang Flight and Condensation of Water
  Vapour
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors analyze the flight of boomerangs and the condensation of water vapor
  in expanding gases. They develop equations of motion for boomerangs and explain
  the returning and non-returning flight paths. Additionally, they study the critical
  expansion of air and other gases, leading to condensation in the absence of foreign
  nuclei.
