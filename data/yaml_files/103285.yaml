tldr: In this experiment, Hauksbee investigates the electrical and luminous properties
  of sulfur. He finds that common sulfur produces a vibrant purple light when used
  in a globe glass, while sublimed sulfur, which has undergone a chemical change,
  loses these properties. This demonstrates the remarkable changes that can be induced
  in a substance's qualities through different management and preparation.
