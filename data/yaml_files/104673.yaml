scientific_subdiscipline: Disease & Pathology
tldr: The author describes the Morbus Strangulatorius, a fatal disease with uncommon
  symptoms, and discusses its diagnosis, pathology, and potential treatments. The
  disease is characterized by a range of symptoms, including swelling of the glands,
  gangrenous sloughs in the mouth, and difficult, noisy, and strangulating respiration.
  The author suggests that the cause of the disease may be due to a lodgment of matter
  in or around the glottis and larynx, which can lead to sudden and unexpected death.
