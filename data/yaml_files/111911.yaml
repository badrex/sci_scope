  Substitution-Compounds of Marsh-Gas'

scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reaction of triethylphosphine with various chlorinated
  derivatives of marsh gas, resulting in the formation of phosphonium compounds. The
  number of phosphine molecules fixed by these derivatives is determined by the number
  of chlorine equivalents they contain, with some compounds capable of fixing one
  or two molecules of triethylphosphine.
