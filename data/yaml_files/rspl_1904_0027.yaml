revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Solids at Low Temperatures and Solid
  Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Cryogenics
tldr: The authors investigate the formation of solids at low temperatures, particularly
  focusing on solid hydrogen. They observe the solidification process and conclude
  that solid hydrogen is a crystalline substance rather than a pseudo-solid, based
  on the sharpness of its formation and the constancy of its melting pressure.
