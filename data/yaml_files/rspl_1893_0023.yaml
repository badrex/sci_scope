revised_title: Investigation of Magnetic Viscosity and Time Effects in Steel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on a steel wire ring to investigate magnetic
  viscosity and time effects in magnetic materials. They find that the difference
  between static and quick cycle curves is not due to the cause suggested by Mr. Evershed,
  and that the time effects observed are small and do not significantly impact the
  overall induction.
