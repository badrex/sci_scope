revised_title: On the Parallax of Double Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Astrometry
tldr: The author proposes a new method to measure the parallax of double stars by
  observing the effect of parallax on their angle of position. This method can detect
  smaller differences in parallax and can be applied to a wider range of stars, including
  those at moderate distances.
