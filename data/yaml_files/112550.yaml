revised_title: Researches on the Refraction-Equivalents of Metals and Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the refraction-equivalents of various compounds and
  metals, focusing on potassium and sodium salts. They determine that the refraction-equivalent
  of potassium is approximately 7.85, while that of sodium is around 6. They also
  find that hydrogen has a higher refraction-equivalent in mineral acids compared
  to organic compounds.
