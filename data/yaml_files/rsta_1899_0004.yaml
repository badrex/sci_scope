tldr: The author presents a mathematical method for reconstructing the stature of
  prehistoric races using regression analysis and correlation coefficients. The method
  involves measuring extant allied races and applying the data to reconstruct the
  extinct race's stature, taking into account factors such as variability, standard
  deviations, and time and climate changes.
