revised_title: 'Investigating Retinal Currents in Frog''s Eye: Effects of Light and
  Electrical Stimulation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: This study examines the retinal currents in a frog's eye when exposed to light
  and electrically stimulated. The author finds that the response to light increases
  with the duration and strength of illumination and that the response changes over
  time, with three distinct stages identified. The study also explores the effects
  of tetanization, desiccation, and anaesthetics on the eye's response.
