  Alloys
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Alloy Development
tldr: The authors study the microstructure and properties of chilled copper-tin alloys,
  observing changes in the alloys during and after solidification. They use a combination
  of cooling curves and microscopic examination to better understand the behavior
  of these alloys, providing insights into their mechanical properties and potential
  applications.
