revised_title: Investigating the Optical Properties of Heated Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Heat Physics
tldr: David Brewster examines the optical properties of heated glass, discovering
  that the effects depend on the progressive differences in temperature within the
  glass plate. He also observes a crystalline structure in the glass during contact
  with heated iron, which he compares to magnetic and electric polarity.
