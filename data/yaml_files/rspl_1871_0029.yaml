revised_title: On the Formation of a Second Modified Hydrate of Sodic Sulphate in
  Supersaturated Solutions of Glauber's Salt
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the effects of low temperatures on supersaturated solutions
  of Glauber's salt and discovers the formation of a second modified hydrate of sodic
  sulphate. This hydrate forms at temperatures below 26Â°F and has unique properties,
  such as opaque white crystals and the ability to cause a rise in temperature during
  crystallization.
