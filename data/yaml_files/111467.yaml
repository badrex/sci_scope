scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the formation of poly-ammonium bases by the action of
  ammonia on bi-acid alcohols and bibasic acids, proposing a new understanding of
  formylia, acetylia, and propylia as di-ammonium compounds. The study also suggests
  the potential for triammonium bases in reactions with tri-acid alcohols.
