revised_title: On Centripetal Forces and Curves Described by Bodies Under Multiple
  Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates centripetal forces and the motion of objects under multiple
  forces, including resistance, and develops equations to determine the curves described
  by these objects. The study covers various scenarios, including objects moving in
  the same or different planes and the effects of forces acting in parallel directions.
topics:
- Mechanics
- Dynamics
- Force Analysis
- Resistances
- Curvilinear Motion
