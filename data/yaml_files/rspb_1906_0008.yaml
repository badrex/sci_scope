revised_title: The Distribution of Chlorides in Nerve Cells and Fibres
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of chlorides in nerve cells and fibers
  using silver nitrate reactions. They find that chlorides of sodium are present in
  nerve fibers and axons, contributing to the electrical properties and conductivity
  of nerves.
