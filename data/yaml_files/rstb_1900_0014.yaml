tldr: The authors investigate the role of stomata in gas exchange and carbon dioxide
  diffusion in plants. They find that the majority of gas exchange occurs through
  open stomata, with a quantitative relationship between stomatal distribution and
  gas exchange rates. The results support the idea that free diffusion is the primary
  mechanism for carbon dioxide uptake in plants.
