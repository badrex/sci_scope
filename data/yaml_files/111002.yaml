revised_title: 'Interference of Light: A New Case and Its Applications'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author, Baden Powell, describes a new case of light interference using a
  prism filled with various substances. He explains the phenomenon using the wave
  theory and derives a formula for the number of bands produced. The method can be
  applied to determine the indices of substances that cannot form prisms and may be
  useful for mineralogists.
