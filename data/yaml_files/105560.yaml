revised_title: Experiments and Observations on the Compressibility of Water and Fluids
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author, John Canton, investigates the compressibility of water and other
  fluids, discovering that water is more compressible in winter than in summer. He
  also observes that fluids are not only compressible but also elastic, expanding
  when the weight compressing them is reduced. This research contributes to the understanding
  of fluid mechanics and the properties of various substances.
