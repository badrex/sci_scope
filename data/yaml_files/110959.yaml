scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates properties of prime numbers, including Wilson's Theorem,
  Gauss's Theorem, and Fermat's Theorem. He demonstrates the connection between these
  theorems and extends them to more general cases. Additionally, he shows that the
  law of reciprocity of prime numbers is a corollary of his theorem.
