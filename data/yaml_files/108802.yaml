revised_title: Investigations on the Molecular Mobility of Gases and Permeation through
  Porous Materials
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the molecular mobility of gases and their diffusion
  through porous materials, focusing on the use of artificial graphite as a diffusion
  septum. The study explores the factors affecting gas permeation and the resistance
  offered by capillary tubes and porous materials to the passage of gases under pressure.
topics:
- Gas Diffusion
- Molecular Mobility
- Porous Materials
- Capillary Transpiration
