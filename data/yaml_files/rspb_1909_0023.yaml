scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the osmotic pressure of Congo-red and other aniline
  dyes, finding that they exhibit colloidal properties and behave as single molecules.
  The study provides insight into the nature of colloidal systems and the effects
  of electrolytes on osmotic pressure.
