revised_title: On the Genus Ocythoe and Anomaly in the Variation of the Magnetic Needle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Malacology & Mollusks
tldr: The author discusses the genus Ocythoe, a shellfish that deviates from the typical
  characteristics of testaceous mollusks. Additionally, the paper mentions the anomaly
  in the variation of the magnetic needle observed on ship-board, suggesting that
  the greatest anomaly is found in ships containing large quantities of iron.
