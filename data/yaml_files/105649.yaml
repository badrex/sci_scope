revised_title: Investigating Conductivity and Electrical Experiments with Different
  Materials
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: John Canton examines the conductivity of various materials, such as tobacco-pipe,
  wood, and glass, in different states of heat and moisture. He discovers that these
  materials' conductivity is influenced by their moisture content and temperature,
  providing insights into the behavior of electrical fluids.
