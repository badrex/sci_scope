revised_title: A New Type of Hydrometer for Measuring the Specific Gravity of Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Instrumentation
tldr: The article describes a new type of hydrometer made of copper, designed by Mr.
  Clarke and communicated by J. T. Desaguliers. This instrument allows for precise
  measurement of the specific gravity of various liquids, particularly spirituous
  liquors, making it useful for customs officers inspecting imported or exported goods.
