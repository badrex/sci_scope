revised_title: The Retarding Effect of Carbon Dioxide on Plant Respiration
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the retarding effect of carbon dioxide on plant respiration,
  revealing that carbon dioxide inhibits growth by interfering with the respiratory
  process and potentially affecting the physical state of plant protoplasm.
topics:
- Carbon Dioxide
- Plant Respiration
- Anaerobic Respiration
- Plant Metabolism
- Carbon Dioxide Inhibition
