tldr: Dr. and Mrs. Huggins investigate the bright bands in the spectrum of Nova Aurigae,
  discovering that the two principal bright bands are actually groups of bright lines
  upon a faint background. They also observe finer lines between these groups, suggesting
  the possibility of absorption lines. Their observations provide insights into the
  change of a star into a nebula.
