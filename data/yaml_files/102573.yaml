revised_title: Experiments and Observations on Sound Reflection and Speed
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the speed of sound
  and its reflection, using pendulums, walls, and echoes. The findings suggest that
  sound moves faster in calm conditions and that the speed of sound may vary depending
  on the environment.
