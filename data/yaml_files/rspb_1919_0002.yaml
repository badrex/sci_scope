revised_title: Flocculation of Colloids by Salts Containing Univalent Organic Ions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Colloid & Surface Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the flocculation of colloids by salts containing univalent
  organic ions, focusing on the relationship between surface tension of salt solutions
  and their capacity for flocculating colloids. The results show that salts with lower
  surface tensions exhibit greater flocculating power, suggesting that flocculation
  may be related to an adsorption process.
