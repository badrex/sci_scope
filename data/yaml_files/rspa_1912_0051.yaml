revised_title: An Investigation of Temperature Coefficients in Precision Balances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Measurement
tldr: The author investigates the temperature coefficients of a precision balance
  and discovers a critical temperature range where the balance's sensitivity becomes
  unstable. The balance's temperature coefficient changes from positive to negative
  values within this range, affecting the accuracy of weighings performed at different
  temperatures.
