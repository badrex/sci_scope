revised_title: Magnetic Properties and Phase Transitions in Nickel-Iron Alloys
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of eight different nickel-iron
  alloys and discovers that some alloys exhibit two critical temperatures at which
  they transition between magnetizable and non-magnetizable states. The author also
  observes changes in physical properties, such as heat absorption and liberation,
  during these phase transitions.
topics:
- Magnetism
- Iron-Nickel Alloys
- Phase Transitions
- Magnetic Properties
- Heating and Cooling Experiments
