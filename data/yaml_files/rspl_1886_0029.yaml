scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: This paper explores the power coordinates and equations of systems of circles
  and spheres, developing ideas from previous works by Clifford and Darboux. It presents
  the fundamental theorem connecting the powers of two systems of circles and applies
  this theorem to various special systems of circles and spheres, as well as discussing
  the properties of curves and cyclides formed by these systems.
