revised_title: Decay of Surface Waves in a Superposed Layer of Viscous Fluid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the decay of surface waves in a superposed layer of
  viscous fluid, specifically focusing on the interaction between glycerine and mercury.
  The study reveals that the rate of decay is always significant, but waves with a
  certain limit, between 2 and 3, are more resistant to damping. The findings have
  implications for understanding wave behavior in various applications, such as optical
  instruments and water waves damped by oil.
