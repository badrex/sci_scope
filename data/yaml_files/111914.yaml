revised_title: Investigating the Functions of the Vagus and Cervical Sympathetic Nerves
  in Humans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author, Augustus Waller, conducts experiments on human subjects to study
  the functions of the vagus and cervical sympathetic nerves. He uses mechanical irritation
  by pressure on the nerve trunk to observe the effects on various bodily functions,
  including breathing, heart rate, and gastrointestinal activity. The study provides
  insights into the sensory and motor functions of these nerves and their role in
  health and disease.
