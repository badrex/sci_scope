revised_title: An Investigation of Coal-Gas and Air Explosions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Dynamics
tldr: This study investigates the behavior of coal-gas and air explosions, focusing
  on the combustion process, temperature distribution, and pressure dynamics. The
  experiments reveal that combustion is nearly complete at maximum pressure, and the
  temperature distribution varies depending on the location within the explosion vessel.
