tldr: The article describes the anatomical preparation of vegetables and fruits, including
  the process of separating the membranes and fibers to reveal the internal structures.
  The method involves soaking the plant material in water, gently squeezing and removing
  the membranes, and preserving the resulting skeletons in spirits of wine. The author,
  Albertus Seba, shares his invention of this technique through his own speculation
  and experimentation.
