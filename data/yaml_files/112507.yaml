revised_title: Resistance of Air to Motion of Elongated Projectiles with Variously
  Formed Heads
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the air resistance experienced by elongated projectiles
  with variously formed heads. The experiments reveal that hollow shot with higher
  initial velocities and angular velocities perform better than solid shot. The author
  also compares his findings with those of M. Helie, arriving at different numerical
  results but agreeing on the law of air resistance.
