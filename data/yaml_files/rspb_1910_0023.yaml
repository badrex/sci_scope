revised_title: The Role of Phosphates in Alcoholic Fermentation by Yeast Juice
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the function of phosphates in alcoholic fermentation
  by yeast juice, finding that phosphates are essential for fermentation and that
  their addition can significantly increase the fermenting power of the enzyme. They
  also demonstrate that the hydrolysis of hexosephosphate by yeast juice produces
  free phosphate and a fermentable sugar.
