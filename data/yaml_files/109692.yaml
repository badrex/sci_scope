revised_title: 'Electro-Chemical Decomposition of Animal Fluids: Observations on Albumen
  and Mucus'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author, William Brande, examines the composition of animal fluids, particularly
  albumen and mucus, using electro-chemical decomposition. He discovers that the voltaic
  apparatus can extract alkalies and acids from these fluids, leading him to question
  whether mucus might be a compound of albumen with soda.
