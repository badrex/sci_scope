revised_title: A Differential Electrostatic Method for Measuring High Electrical Resistances
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The authors describe a differential electrostatic method for measuring high
  electrical resistances using an ordinary quadrant electrometer and a variable resistance.
  The method can determine the relative insulation quality of materials, measure insulation
  resistance in high-pressure circuits, and detect faults or points of zero potential.
