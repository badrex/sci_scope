revised_title: A New Hypothesis for Osmotic Effects
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author proposes a new hypothesis for osmotic effects, suggesting that the
  primary osmotic effect is exercised by the solvent, and that electrolytes have an
  excessive influence due to their attractive effect on water molecules. This hypothesis
  explains the behavior of salts in solution and accounts for the marked activity
  of electrolytes compared to non-electrolytes.
