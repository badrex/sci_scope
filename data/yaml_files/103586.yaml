tldr: This letter from Ralph Thoresby describes a violent rainstorm and its disastrous
  effects on Ripponden, Yorkshire. The storm caused a sudden and devastating flood,
  resulting in the destruction of houses, mills, bridges, and the death of fifteen
  people. The rapidness of the torrent was so violent that it even tore up the dead
  from their graves.
