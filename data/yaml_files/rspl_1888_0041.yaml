revised_title: The Structure and Development of the Electric Organ in Raia radiata
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: The study investigates the differences in the electric organs of two species
  of skate, Raia radiata and Raja circularis. It examines the structure, development,
  and evolutionary implications of the electric organ in R. radiata, which is smaller
  and less complex than that of R. circularis. The research suggests that the electric
  organ in R. radiata is in a state of progressive development, despite its small
  size and apparent uselessness.
