revised_title: Further Observations on the Spectrum of Spontaneous Luminous Radiation
  of Radium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of spontaneous luminous radiation emitted
  by radium and its interaction with nitrogen. They find that the radium glow spectrum
  coincides with the band spectrum of nitrogen, suggesting that the radium rays may
  be responsible for exciting the nitrogen molecules. The authors also explore the
  possibility of detecting the presence of helium in the radium glow spectrum but
  find no evidence of its presence.
