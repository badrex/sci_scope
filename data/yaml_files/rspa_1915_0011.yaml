revised_title: A New Type of Series in Helium's Band Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author discovers a new type of series in the band spectrum associated with
  helium, which follows the law of line series rather than the usual arrangement of
  band spectra. The structure of the individual bands is similar to those distributed
  in a more conventional manner, and the doublet bands are arranged similarly to lines
  in an ordinary line series.
