revised_title: Magnetization and Change of Resistance in Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between magnetization and the change
  of resistance in iron. They find that the change of resistance is approximately
  proportional to the fourth power of the magnetization, suggesting a close connection
  between the two phenomena.
