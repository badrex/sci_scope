scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates the conditions for the existence of three equal roots
  or two pairs of equal roots in binary quartics and quintics, using matrix theory
  and determinants. The study provides insights into the composition of relations
  and the conditions for the existence of given systems of equalities between the
  roots of an equation.
