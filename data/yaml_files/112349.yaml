scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the physical constitution of the Sun and stars, focusing
  on the distribution and temperature of their atmospheres, and the nature of their
  dark and luminous regions. The study suggests that the Sun's outer atmosphere is
  cooler than the luminous region beneath, and that the temperature increases from
  the surface of the solar atmosphere downwards.
