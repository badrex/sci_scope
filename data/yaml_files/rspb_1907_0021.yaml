revised_title: 'Longitudinal Symmetry in Phanerogamia: A Study of Internode Curves
  and Leaf Displacements'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: This study investigates the longitudinal symmetry in plants using a graphic
  method to record measurements of internode lengths and leaf displacements. The findings
  reveal that the displacement sub-curve represents the distances up which one leaf
  at each successive node has been relatively displaced from a primitively opposite
  arrangement, providing insights into plant taxonomy and morphology.
