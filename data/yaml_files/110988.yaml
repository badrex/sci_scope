revised_title: 'Elastic Force of Vapor at Different Temperatures: A Comparative Analysis
  of Formulas'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: Captain Shortrede compares various formulas for the elastic force of vapor at
  different temperatures, ultimately favoring a modified formula that better aligns
  with experimental data. He also discusses the discrepancies between different experiments
  and suggests that errors in temperature measurement may be a contributing factor.
