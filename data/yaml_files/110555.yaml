revised_title: Preventing Dry-Rot in Ships with Salt Impregnation
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Shipbuilding & Naval Architecture
tldr: James Mease proposes using salt to impregnate ship timbers and planks to prevent
  dry-rot, a method used by shipbuilders in Philadelphia. The salt penetrates and
  saturates the wood, inhibiting fermentation and the production of foul air. Some
  dampness is a minor inconvenience, but the author suggests possible remedies.
