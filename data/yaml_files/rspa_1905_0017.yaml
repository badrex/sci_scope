revised_title: Investigation of Vapour-Pressure Determination by Air-Bubbling and
  Effects of Supersaturation, Dust, and Electrification
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the determination of vapour-pressure using air-bubbling
  and examine the effects of supersaturation, dust in the air, and electrification
  on the results. They find that these factors have no appreciable effect on the accuracy
  of the method.
