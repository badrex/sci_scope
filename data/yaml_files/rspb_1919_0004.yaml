  using the Kata-Thermometer
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: This study investigates the cooling and evaporative powers of the atmosphere
  using the kata-thermometer, a sensitive instrument that measures temperature changes.
  The researchers found that the kata-thermometer can detect air movements that are
  too small to affect other anemometers, making it useful in studying ventilation
  and air flow in rooms. The study also provides a formula for calculating the cooling
  power due to evaporation, taking into account factors such as air velocity, temperature,
  and humidity.
