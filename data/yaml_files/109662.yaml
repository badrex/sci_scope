revised_title: Hydraulic Investigations and the Motion of Blood
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: Thomas Young investigates the motion of fluids in pipes, resistance caused by
  flexure, propagation of impulses through fluid-filled tubes, and the effect of progressive
  contraction in canals. He presents a new formula for fluid flow and discusses the
  implications for blood circulation.
