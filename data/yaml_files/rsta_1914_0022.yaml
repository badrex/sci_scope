revised_title: The Spark Spectrum of Nickel Under Moderate Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of moderate pressures on the spark spectrum
  of nickel, finding significant changes in the character of the spectral lines. They
  discuss the implications of these findings for astrophysical problems, particularly
  the pressure of the solar reversing layer.
