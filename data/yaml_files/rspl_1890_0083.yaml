revised_title: The Structure of Amoeboid Protoplasm and Comparison with Muscular Tissue
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: 'The author investigates the structure of amoeboid protoplasm and compares it
  to muscular tissue. They find that protoplasm is composed of two distinct substances:
  spongioplasm and hyaloplasm. Spongioplasm has a reticular arrangement and stains
  with hematoxylin, while hyaloplasm is structureless and highly labile. The author
  suggests that the movements of cells are produced by the active flowing of hyaloplasm,
  rather than the contraction of spongioplasm.'
