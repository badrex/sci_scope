revised_title: 'On the Principal Electric Time-Constant of a Circular Disk: A Further
  Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author investigates the electric time-constant of a circular disk, determining
  that it is not less than a certain value and providing a formula for calculating
  it. The study focuses on the resistance and decay of electric currents in the disk,
  with implications for understanding the behavior of electric currents in conductive
  materials.
