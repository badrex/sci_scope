revised_title: Investigation of Spinal-Root Connections and Ganglion-Cell Connections
  of Nerve-Fibres Affecting Spleen Contraction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the spinal-root connections and ganglion-cell connections
  of nerve-fibres responsible for spleen contraction in dogs. They find that the largest
  outflow of nerve-roots occurs from the fifth to the ninth postcervical inclusive,
  and that the outflow is larger on the left side. The nerve-fibres likely have a
  cell connection in the main ganglionic chain of the sympathetic nervous system.
