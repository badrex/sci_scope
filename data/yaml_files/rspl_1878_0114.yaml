revised_title: Researches on the Absorption of Ultra-Violet Rays by Organic Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of ultra-violet rays by various organic
  substances using spectroscopy and photography. They find that normal alcohols, fatty
  acids, and ethereal salts exhibit different levels of absorption, while benzene
  derivatives show powerful absorption and unique spectra. This research has implications
  for identifying and testing the purity of organic compounds.
