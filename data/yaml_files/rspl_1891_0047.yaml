revised_title: Melting Points of Gold-Aluminium Alloys and the Formation of a True
  Compound
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the melting points of gold-aluminium alloys and discovers
  that the purple alloy, AuA12, has a higher melting point than gold, suggesting it
  is a true compound of gold and aluminium. The melting points of other gold-aluminium
  alloys fall continuously, with the white alloy containing 10% aluminium having a
  melting point 417 degrees lower than gold.
