scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of acid, alkali, and certain indicators
  on the development of eggs of Pleuronectes platessa and Echinus esculentus. The
  results show that eggs are more sensitive to environmental influences and chemical
  disturbances as they age. Additionally, the study discovers that dimethyl-amido-azo-benzol
  and phenol-phthalein have specific actions on the two organisms, with dimethyl being
  deadly to Pleuronectes eggs and phenol-phthalein being very injurious to Echinus
  eggs.
