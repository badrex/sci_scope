revised_title: Anatomical and Optical Structure of Crystalline Lenses in Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the anatomical and optical structure of the crystalline
  lenses in animals, particularly in cod, using polarized light. The study reveals
  that the lens's structure consists of transparent laminae that converge to two poles,
  and the fibers' breadth tapers as they approach the poles.
