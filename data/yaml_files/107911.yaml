tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of the variations of elliptic constants
  in physical astronomy, focusing on the stability of planetary systems and the effects
  of the disturbing force on their orbits. The study includes equations for the rectangular
  co-ordinates and the development of the disturbing function R to the quantities
  involving the squares and products of the eccentricities.
