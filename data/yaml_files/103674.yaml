revised_title: Hydraulic Experiments and the Forces of Moving Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on fluid dynamics and hydraulics, specifically
  examining the relationship between the height of a fluid column and the velocity
  of the fluid issuing from an orifice. The results support the idea that the forces
  of moving bodies are proportional to the squares of their velocities.
