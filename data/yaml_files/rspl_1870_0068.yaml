tldr: The Astronomer Royal, G. B. Airy, critiques Sir William Thomson's proposed method
  for determining a ship's location at sea using celestial observations and chronometer
  readings. Airy argues that the method is flawed due to its reliance on accurate
  chronometer readings, which are often uncertain, and suggests that the uncertainty
  of latitude is less significant than the uncertainty of chronometric longitude.
