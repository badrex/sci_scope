revised_title: Malaria Hemoglobin Metabolism and its Connection to Blackwater Fever
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The study examines the relationship between hemoglobin metabolism and malaria,
  particularly in cases of malignant tertian malaria and blackwater fever. It reveals
  that the destruction of red blood cells is much greater than the number of cells
  infected by parasites, and that the liver helps maintain a balance to prevent hemoglobinuria.
  The research also highlights the importance of fecal urobilin excretion in understanding
  the extent of hemolysis in these conditions.
