revised_title: Surface Tremors and Earthquake Propagation in Elastic Solids
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Studies
tldr: 'The author investigates the propagation of tremors over the surface of an elastic
  solid, focusing on the vibrations caused by an impulse applied to the surface. The
  study reveals that surface disturbances can be analyzed into two parts: the minor
  tremor and the main shock. The main shock is propagated as a solitary wave with
  a constant time-scale and amplitude that decreases according to the law of annular
  divergence.'
