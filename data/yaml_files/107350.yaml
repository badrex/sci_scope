revised_title: Lithological Survey of Schehallien and its Impact on the Specific Gravity
  of Rocks
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author conducts a lithological survey of Schehallien mountain to determine
  the specific gravity of the rocks that compose it. The survey involves collecting
  specimens of various rock types and estimating the quantity and position of each
  type relative to the observatories on the mountain. The findings contribute to understanding
  the mean density of the earth and the attraction of the mountain.
