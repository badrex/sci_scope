scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Volcanology
tldr: The author, Thomas West, describes a volcanic hill near Inverness, Scotland,
  and provides specimens of lava from the site. He discusses the features of the hill,
  including its steep, craggy terrain and fused rocks, and examines the possibility
  of it being a volcano. The specimens are later judged by members of the Royal Society
  to be real lava, suggesting that the hill may have volcanic origins.
