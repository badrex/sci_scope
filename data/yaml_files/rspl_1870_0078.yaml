revised_title: Innovative Atmospheric Pressure Instrument for Recording Minute Variations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author presents a new hydraulic instrument, the differential microbarograph,
  designed to record minute variations in atmospheric pressure. The instrument uses
  a unique system of continuous recording, allowing for the detection of wave-like
  motions and pulsations of pressure, providing valuable data for meteorological research.
