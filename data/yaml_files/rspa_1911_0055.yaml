revised_title: A New Approach to Generating Fourier Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The author presents a new method for generating Fourier series, focusing on
  parametric integration and the Lipschitz condition. The method is applicable to
  functions of bounded variation and can be extended to other cases as well.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Parametric integration
- Trigonometric series
- Function of bounded variation
- Lipschitz condition
