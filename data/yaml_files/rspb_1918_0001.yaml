  by Bacillus coli communis: Part II - Experiments of Short Duration with an Emulsion
  of the Organisms'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the enzymes involved in the decomposition of glucose
  and mannitol by Bacillus coli communis using an emulsion of the bacteria. The study
  aims to separate the process of growth from fermentation and provides insights into
  the fermentation process and the origin of succinic acid.

- Bacterial Metabolism
- Enzyme Action
- Fermentation
- Bacillus coli communis
