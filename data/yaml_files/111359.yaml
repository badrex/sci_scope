revised_title: Experiments on the Plasticity of Ice and the Structure of Glaciers
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryosphere
tldr: The authors investigate the properties of ice and its behavior in glaciers through
  various experiments, demonstrating its plasticity and challenging the viscous theory
  of glacier motion. They also explore the structure of glacier ice and its laminar
  formation, providing alternative explanations for previous theories.
