revised_title: 'The Residual Charge of the Leyden Jar: A Study on Dielectric Polarization
  and Residual Charges'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author investigates the residual charge of a Leyden jar and proposes a model
  to explain the phenomenon. The model suggests that the residual charge is due to
  the time-dependent polarization of dielectric materials, which can be influenced
  by factors such as the intensity of electric force and the dielectric's properties.
