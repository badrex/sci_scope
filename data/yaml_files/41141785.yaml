scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The authors conducted a series of observations to determine the amount of atmospheric
  refraction at Port Bowen in 1824-25. They used various methods and instruments,
  such as repeating circles and theodolites, to measure the zenith distances of stars
  and the effects of temperature, barometer, and thermometer on their observations.
  The results provide valuable data for understanding atmospheric refraction in polar
  regions.
