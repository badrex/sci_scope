revised_title: Experimental Researches on Diamagnetic Action and Induced Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Faraday investigates the diamagnetic action and induced currents in various
  metals, concluding that the observed phenomena are primarily due to induced currents
  rather than polarity. He also establishes a connection between these effects and
  the previously described phenomena of revulsion.
