scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the temperature variations in the human body in healthy
  individuals, focusing on diurnal fluctuations and their relationship to health.
  The authors found that the average maximum temperature in boys around 12 years old
  is 99.1°F, with a diurnal variation of about 2.2°F. The study also highlights the
  importance of continuous observations to accurately measure temperature changes
  and understand their implications in health and disease.
