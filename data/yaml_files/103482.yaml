tldr: The author, Sir Hans Sloane, describes a pair of large, curved horns found in
  Wapping and speculates that they may have belonged to a large, odd-shaped beast
  native to Ethiopia and other parts of Africa. He compares the horns to those of
  the Sukotyro, a creature mentioned by Nieuhoff in his travels to the East Indies.
