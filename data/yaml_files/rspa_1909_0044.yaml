revised_title: Maximizing the Efficiency of Energy Utilization from Stretched Rubber
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the most efficient ways to utilize the energy stored
  in stretched rubber for mechanical work, finding that the conversion process must
  occur in cycles and that frictional losses must be minimized to achieve maximum
  efficiency.
