  Study'

tldr: The author describes a case where pressure on the carotid artery successfully
  cured a patient's nervous affection. The study suggests that excessive blood flow
  to the brain, caused by a morbidly dilated carotid artery, leads to brain irritation
  and subsequent nervous disorders. The author proposes a therapeutic approach based
  on this principle, which has proven effective in treating various cases of spasmodic
  and nervous affections.
