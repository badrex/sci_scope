revised_title: Improving the Measurement of Luminous Intensity of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the luminous intensity of light
  using a uniform glass lamp and a photometer that employs polarized light. This method
  allows for more accurate comparisons of lights with different colors and overcomes
  some limitations of previous methods, such as the use of candles as light-measures.
