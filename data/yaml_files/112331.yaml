revised_title: Temperature Influence on Electric Conducting-Power of Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the electric conducting-power
  of alloys, finding that the percentage decrement in conducting-power is never greater
  than that of the pure metals composing them. They also develop a method to deduce
  the conducting-power of a pure metal from that of an impure one and discuss the
  chemical nature of alloys.
