revised_title: The Microstructure and Hardening Mechanism in Ductile Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the hard and soft states in ductile metals, specifically
  gold, and discovers that hardness is conferred by the development of a structure
  where distorted crystalline units are cemented together by a portion of the metal
  that has momentarily flowed around them. This research provides insights into the
  mechanisms of metal hardening and its implications for metallurgists and engineers.
