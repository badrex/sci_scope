revised_title: Anode and Cathode Spectra of Various Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the anode and cathode spectra of various gases and vapors,
  finding that the spectra differ significantly depending on the gas or vapor. The
  results support the hypothesis of electrolysis and reveal the influence of electrode
  reactions on the spectra.
