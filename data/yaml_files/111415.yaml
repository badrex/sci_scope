revised_title: Effects of Magnetization on the Electric Conductivity of Nickel and
  Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetization on the electric conductivity
  of nickel and iron. They find that magnetization increases the resistance of nickel
  and iron when subjected to longitudinal magnetization, while transverse magnetization
  decreases the resistance. The study also reveals that the effect of longitudinal
  magnetization on nickel is three to four times greater than on iron, while the effect
  of transverse magnetization remains nearly the same for both metals.
