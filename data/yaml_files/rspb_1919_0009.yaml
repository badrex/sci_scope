revised_title: The Role of Calcium Salts in Bacterial Infection and Gas Gangrene
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors discover that injecting small doses of calcium salts with virulent
  strains of bacteria, such as B. Welchii and Vibrion septique, can consistently produce
  gas gangrene in mice and guinea pigs. This phenomenon, called 'kataphylaxis' or
  'defense-rupture,' demonstrates that a new factor, extrinsic to the infection, is
  necessary for the development of gas gangrene in susceptible animals.
