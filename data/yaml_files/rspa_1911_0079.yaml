scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author investigates incomplete colour-blindness and the trichromatic theory
  of colour vision, proposing a method to determine the amount of colour perception
  deficiency quantitatively. The method involves using a colour patch apparatus and
  adjusting the slits in the spectrum to match the white perception of colour-blind
  individuals.
