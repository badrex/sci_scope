revised_title: Investigating the Cause of Colored Concentric Rings and Other Similar
  Appearances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the formation of colored concentric
  rings and other related phenomena by examining the effects of surface curvature,
  prism experiments, and critical separation of colors. He concludes that these phenomena
  arise from the same critical separation at the boundary of prismatic reflection,
  suggesting that differences in refrangibility alone can explain the observed effects.
