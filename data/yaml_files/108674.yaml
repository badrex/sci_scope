revised_title: 'Magnetic Induction in Crystals: A New Hypothesis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Julius Plucker investigates the magnetic induction of crystals and proposes
  a new hypothesis involving ellipsoids and magnetic axes to explain the magnetic
  behavior of uniaxal and biaxial crystals. This hypothesis is supported by both theoretical
  analysis and experimental results.
