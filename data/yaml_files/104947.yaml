revised_title: Improving Distillation Efficiency through Ventilation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Engineering & Technology
tldr: The author discovers a method to significantly increase the efficiency of distillation
  by introducing a constant shower of fresh air through the boiling liquor in a still.
  This method can potentially benefit navigation by providing a faster and more fuel-efficient
  way to produce fresh water at sea.
