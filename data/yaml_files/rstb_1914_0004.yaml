tldr: This study investigates the evolution of Cretaceous Asteroidea, focusing on
  the classification and zonal determination of these marine creatures. The author
  examines the variations in species and their lineage, as well as the impact of environmental
  factors on their evolution. The research also explores the use of isolated ossicles
  for zonal determinations and the potential for an Asteroid fauna-based zonal classification.
