revised_title: On the Progressive Paralysis of Different Classes of Nerve Cells in
  the Superior Cervical Ganglion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of nicotin on nerve cells in the superior
  cervical ganglion and find that different classes of nerve cells are paralysed in
  a specific order. They also observe the effects of stimulating the sympathetic on
  the blood supply of the lips and gums, discovering variations in the strength of
  stimulus required for different regions.
