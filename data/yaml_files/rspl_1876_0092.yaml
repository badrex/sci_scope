revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Temperature and Humidity on Air Quality
  and Ventilation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Climate
tldr: The author examines the relationship between temperature, humidity, and air
  quality, finding that an increase in humidity has a more significant impact on perceived
  air quality than an increase in temperature. The study suggests that proper hygrometric
  conditions should be maintained alongside temperature regulation for optimal ventilation,
  especially in healthcare settings.
