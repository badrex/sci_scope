  of Photoelectric Activity in Zinc Under Illumination'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Surface Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the photoelectric fatigue of zinc, observing that the
  photoelectric activity of zinc diminishes rapidly at first, then slows down over
  time. The results show that the decay of activity can be expressed by a single exponential
  term after about half an hour of exposure to light.
