scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: The author presents a simple and easy-to-use instrument called the 'Collision
  Predictor' that helps mariners predict and avoid potential ship collisions at sea
  by interpreting the distance and course of two vessels using a geometrical construction
  and a mechanical method.
