revised_title: Investigation of Porcelain's Electrical Properties and Dielectric Losses
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This study investigates the electrical properties of porcelain, including its
  dielectric constant, dielectric losses, and apparent conductivity. The research
  finds that temperature has a significant impact on the dielectric constant, and
  that porcelain exhibits different behaviors depending on the rate of potential changes
  and the number of cycles of electrification.
