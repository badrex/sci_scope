revised_title: Experimental Determination of Magneto-Electric Induction in Different
  Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the intensity of electric currents
  in different metals under the same magneto-electric induction. The results show
  that the intensity of the currents is proportional to the conducting powers of the
  metals, with copper having a higher intensity than iron.
