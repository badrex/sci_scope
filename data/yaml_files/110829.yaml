revised_title: The Role of Respiration in Maintaining Animal Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author challenges the prevailing opinion that animal temperature is directly
  proportional to their respiration. He presents examples of various animals where
  increased respiration does not raise the animal temperature, leading him to consider
  respiration as a cooling rather than heating process.
