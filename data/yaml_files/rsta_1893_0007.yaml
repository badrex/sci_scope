revised_title: Investigating the Thickness and Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid
  Films
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors investigate the thickness and electrical resistance of thin liquid
  films, specifically soap films, using both optical and electrical methods. They
  find that the mean thickness of black films increases when the proportion of potassium
  nitrate or soap is diminished, and discuss the factors affecting the formation and
  thickness of these films.
