tldr: The author investigates the transformation of carbohydrates in the animal system,
  discovering that certain ferments can convert glucose into a body with the same
  cupric oxide reducing power as maltose, and that the liver contains a ferment capable
  of converting glucose into maltose under certain conditions.
