revised_title: Investigating Cattle as a Reservoir for Sleeping Sickness Virus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate whether cattle can act as a reservoir for the virus
  of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They conduct experiments to determine
  if cattle can be infected through subcutaneous injections, bites of artificially-infected
  tsetse flies, and bites of naturally-infected flies. The results show that cattle
  can be infected and can potentially spread the virus to other animals.
