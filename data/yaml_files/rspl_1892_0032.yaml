tldr: Lieut.-General R. Strachey investigates the effects of limiting the number of
  ordinary fellows elected into the Royal Society to fifteen per year on the eventual
  total number of fellows. He examines historical data and concludes that the reduction
  in the number of fellows is primarily due to the restriction on yearly elections.
