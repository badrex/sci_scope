revised_title: The Effects of Increased Barometric Pressure on Oxygen Bubbles in the
  Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of increased barometric pressure on the
  formation of oxygen bubbles in the body. The authors find that when animals are
  exposed to high oxygen levels and then rapidly decompressed, oxygen bubbles form
  in the blood vessels, leading to convulsions and potential harm. They suggest that
  slow decompression is the safest method to avoid this issue.
