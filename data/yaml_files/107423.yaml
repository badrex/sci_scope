revised_title: Investigating Electro-Chemical Phenomena and the Attraction of Flames
  and Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, investigates the behavior of flames and gases
  when placed between surfaces in opposite electrical states. He discovers that the
  negative surface becomes heated faster and attracts certain flames and gases, while
  the positive surface attracts others. This is due to the chemical nature of the
  substances involved and their electro-chemical attraction.
