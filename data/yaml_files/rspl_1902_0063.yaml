revised_title: Prolonged Exposure to Liquid Air Temperature and Its Effects on Micro-Organisms
  and Photogenic Bacteria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of prolonged exposure to liquid air temperature
  on micro-organisms and photogenic bacteria. The results show that a six-month exposure
  to -190Â°C has no appreciable effect on the vitality of micro-organisms, and mechanical
  trituration at the temperature of liquid air abolishes the luminosity of photogenic
  bacteria, suggesting that bioluminescence is a function of the living cell.
