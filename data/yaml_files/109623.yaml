scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Matthew Flinders' observations on the marine barometer during his examination
  of the coasts of New Holland and New South Wales reveal the effects of wind direction
  on the mercury levels. Flinders explains that changes in wind direction cause the
  mercury to rise or fall, and offers an explanation for these phenomena based on
  the interaction between air currents and landforms.
