revised_title: The Relationship Between Solubility and Fusibility of Salts at High
  Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This paper investigates the solubility of various salts in water at high temperatures
  and finds that solubility is directly related to fusibility. The authors also discuss
  the limitations of hydration theories in explaining the act of solution.
topics:
- Solubility
- Fusibility
- Chemical Reactions
- Thermodynamics
- Salt Chemistry
