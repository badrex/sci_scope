tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, investigates the elementary laws of electricity
  and improves the hydrostatic electrometer for more accurate measurements. He also
  examines the nature of inductive influence and presents formulae for direct and
  reflected induction, as well as the force of attraction between charged and neutral
  conductors.
