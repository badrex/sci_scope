revised_title: Investigating the Heating Effect of Rapid Rotation in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors, Balfour Stewart and P. G. Tait, investigate the heating effect
  produced by rapidly rotating a disk in a vacuum. They find that the heating effect
  is due to radiant heat and not conduction, magnetic force, or condensation of water
  vapor. The study contributes to the understanding of heat generation in vacuum environments.
