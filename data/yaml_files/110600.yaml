revised_title: The Role of Light in the Coloration of River Sponges
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: John Hogg's study reveals that the green color of the River Sponge is solely
  acquired through the influence of light and is lost when the sponge is removed from
  it. This distinguishes the River Sponge from other polyps, leading Hogg to consider
  it more closely related to algae or fungi than other animal species.
