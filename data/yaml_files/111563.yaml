  and Nutrition

scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Evolution
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the influence of white light, different
  colored rays, and darkness on the development, growth, and nutrition of animals
  and plants. The results show that animal development is not directly influenced
  by light, while plant nutrition relies on it. This challenges preconceived notions
  about the relationship between light and animal health.
