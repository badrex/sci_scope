revised_title: Investigating the Occlusion of Hydrogen and Oxygen by Palladium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the occlusion of hydrogen and oxygen by palladium in
  various states, such as black, sponge, and foil. They find that palladium black
  and sponge occlude similar amounts of hydrogen, while palladium foil behaves differently.
  The study also examines the heat evolved during the occlusion process and the atomic
  ratios of palladium to hydrogen in different forms of palladium.
