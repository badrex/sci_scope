scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author, P. W. Barlow, investigates the efficiency of steam-vessel paddle-wheel
  designs, comparing a new construction with the common wheel. He finds that vertically
  acting paddles offer advantages in deep immersion, but less so in shallow immersion
  due to increased resistance and power consumption. Barlow also discusses the effects
  of paddle size, wheel diameter, and boat loading on vessel propulsion.
