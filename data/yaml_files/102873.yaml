revised_title: The Influence of Respiration on the Motion of the Heart
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the influence of respiration on the motion of the heart
  and suggests that the intercostal muscles and diaphragm aid in the contraction of
  the heart by facilitating blood flow through the lungs. This assists in the systole
  and prevents the diastole from being hindered by the force of blood rushing into
  the ventricles.
