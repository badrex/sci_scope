revised_title: 'The Effect of Pressure on Copper Arc Spectra: Displacement, Broadening,
  and Intensity Changes'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the effect of pressure on the spectra of copper arcs,
  focusing on the displacement, broadening, and changes in intensity of the lines.
  The results show that under high pressures, lines become broader and are displaced
  towards longer wavelengths, with different rates of increase for each line. The
  intensity of lines belonging to the first and second subordinate series decreases
  with increasing pressure, while non-series lines become relatively stronger.
