revised_title: Investigation of Water Flow in Curved Pipes
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: The author investigates the resistance to the flow of water in curved pipes
  and finds that the change from straight to coiled tube flow is accompanied by an
  increasing resistance, which can be represented by a formula that considers the
  time of flow, curvature, and tube radius.
