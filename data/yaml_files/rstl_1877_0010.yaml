revised_title: 'On Hyperjacobian Surfaces and Curves: Extending the Theory of Jacobian
  Surfaces and Curves'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates hyperjacobian surfaces and curves, extending the concepts
  of jacobian surfaces and curves. They explore the properties of these surfaces and
  curves, focusing on the points of contact between them and the principal points
  of the system.
