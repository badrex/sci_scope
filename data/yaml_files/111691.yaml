revised_title: Effects of Freezing on the Physiological Properties of Muscles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of freezing on the physiological properties
  of muscles, discovering that completely frozen muscles lose irritability, while
  those frozen for a short time may regain it upon thawing. The loss of irritability
  is due to the freezing process rather than just the fall of temperature, and the
  revival of irritability is influenced by the treatment the muscles receive when
  thawed.
