revised_title: Observations of Jupiter's Satellites Eclipses by John Goldingham
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science
tldr: John Goldingham observed and documented the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites
  using two Dollond telescopes with a magnifying power of 70-80. He noted the weather
  conditions, the altitude of the planet, and the relative position of the planet
  and moon to ensure accurate observations. Goldingham recommends considering both
  immersion and emersion data to minimize errors in eclipse observations.
