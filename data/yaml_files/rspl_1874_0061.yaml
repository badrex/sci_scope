revised_title: Investigating Reversed Tracings in Sphygmography
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Physiology
tldr: The author examines reversed tracings in sphygmography and discovers that they
  are caused by the malposition of the instrument, specifically when the brass plate
  rests on the artery. The study also reveals that excessive pressure can modify the
  form of the tracing.
