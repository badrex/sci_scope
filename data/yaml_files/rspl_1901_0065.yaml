revised_title: Separation and Spectral Analysis of the Least Volatile Gases in Atmospheric
  Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors describe a method for separating and analyzing the least volatile
  gases in atmospheric air using fractional distillation and low-temperature techniques.
  They identify the spectra of various gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, krypton,
  and xenon, and discuss the differences in their spectral properties.
