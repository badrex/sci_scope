revised_title: 'Effects of Strain on the Crystalline Structure of Lead: A Study of
  Crystal Growth and Orientation'
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Crystallography
tldr: This study investigates the effects of strain on the crystalline structure of
  lead, focusing on crystal growth and orientation. The author examines the growth
  of crystals in a casting and the subsequent effects of annealing at low temperatures,
  providing insights into the behavior of metals under strain.
