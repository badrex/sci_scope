revised_title: The Crystal Structure of Diamond
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Crystallography
tldr: The authors use X-ray diffraction techniques to analyze the crystal structure
  of diamond, determining the positions of carbon atoms within the face-centered lattice
  and confirming the simple cubic arrangement of atoms in the diamond structure.
topics:
- Crystallography
- X-ray Diffraction
- Diamond Structure
- Face-Centered Lattice
