revised_title: Investigation of Friction between Surfaces Moving at Low Speeds
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Tribology
tldr: The authors design an apparatus to study the friction between surfaces moving
  at low speeds and find that kinetic friction gradually increases as velocity decreases,
  suggesting continuity between static and kinetic friction in certain cases.
topics:
- Friction
- Low Speeds
- Static Friction
- Kinetic Friction
- Surface Properties
