revised_title: Effects of Cooling Magnetized Iron and Steels to the Temperature of
  Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the changes in magnetization of various iron and steel
  samples when cooled to the temperature of liquid air. They observe that the magnetic
  moment of the samples changes depending on their composition and temper, with some
  samples experiencing an increase in magnetization upon cooling.
