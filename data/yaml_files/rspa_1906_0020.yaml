revised_title: The Effect of High Temperatures on Radium Emanation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of high temperatures on the activity of radium
  emanation in equilibrium with its products A, B, and C. They find that the activity
  can be changed by heating above 1000°C, with the effect increasing with temperature
  up to 1200°C. The results suggest that the rate of decay of one of the products
  is affected by temperature.
