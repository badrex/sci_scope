revised_title: On the Origin and Development of Leaf Arrangement
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The authors explore the purpose and development of leaf arrangement in plants,
  suggesting that the different leaf orders have evolved from a common ancestral order
  through varying degrees of twist in the plant's axis. They also propose that the
  two-ranked alternate order is the simplest and most likely to be the original leaf
  arrangement, while more complex spiral orders and whorled orders have been derived
  from it.
