revised_title: Investigation of Gases Emitted During Diamond Conversion to Coke via
  Cathode Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate whether diamonds emit any rare gases, such as neon or
  krypton, during their conversion to coke using cathode rays. They compare the spectra
  of the residual gases before and after the conversion and find no evidence of any
  rare gases being released.
