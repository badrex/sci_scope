revised_title: Electrometer Improvements and Variations in Electromotive Force of
  Clark Cells
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Measurement
tldr: The authors discuss improvements to the electrometer and the effects of temperature
  on the electromotive force of Clark cells. They provide numerical results and curves
  for the electrometer used and investigate the error in the ordinary assumption of
  the effective area of the attracted disk.
