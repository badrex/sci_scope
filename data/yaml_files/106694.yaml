  Cold
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The author describes experiments on the congelation of mercury using frigorific
  mixtures of nitrous acid and diluted vitriolic acid. He also investigates the production
  of artificial cold and its effects on mercury, demonstrating that mercury can be
  frozen in summer and in hot climates with the right combination of frigorific mixtures.
