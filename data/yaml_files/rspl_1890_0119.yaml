revised_title: Micro-chemical Detection of Iron in Chromatin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of iron in chromatin using micro-chemical
  methods and find that iron is present in the chromatin of a large number of cell
  species. The iron is not combined as an albuminate but in a condition similar to
  potassium ferrocyanide or haematin. This study suggests that chromatin may contain
  iron, although further research is needed to determine if this is true for all cells.
