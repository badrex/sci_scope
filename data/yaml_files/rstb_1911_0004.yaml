  and Flora'

scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Stratigraphy
tldr: The authors examine the lignite of Bovey Tracey in Devon, England, and conclude
  that it is of Upper Oligocene age, based on the flora found within the deposit.
  This finding fills a gap in the British geological sequence and provides insight
  into the gradual transition from warm-temperate to cooler climates in the region.
