revised_title: Investigating the Resistance of Air to the Motion of Elongated Projectiles
  with Variously Formed Heads
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author, F. Bashforth, investigates the resistance of air to elongated projectiles
  with variously formed heads, finding that the resistance increases as the cube of
  the velocity. He develops a chronograph to measure the time occupied by a projectile
  in passing over successive equal spaces, providing a more accurate method for determining
  air resistance.
