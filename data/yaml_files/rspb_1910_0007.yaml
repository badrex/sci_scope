  on Isolated Muscles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: This study compares the effects of stovaine and cocaine on muscle contractility
  and toxicity. The results show that both drugs have similar physiological activity,
  with only slight differences in their toxic effects, favoring cocaine as the less
  toxic option.
