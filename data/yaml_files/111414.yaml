tldr: The author, Spence Bate, examines the development of Carcinus Maenas, a common
  crab, from the Zoea stage to the adult form. He argues that the changes in development
  are gradual and not a sudden transformation. Bate also discusses the role of appendages
  in the larvae and their connection to the adult form.
