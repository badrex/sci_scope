tldr: This study investigates the semidiurnal tides of Port Leopold in North Somerset,
  providing calculations for the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, solitidal and lunitidal
  intervals, and the ratio of solar to lunar coefficients. The author also estimates
  the depth of the Atlantic based on tidal theories, suggesting a depth of 3.529 miles
  from semidiurnal tidal intervals.
