scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author examines the properties and constitution of ozone, investigating
  its formation and composition through various experiments. The study concludes that
  different methods of ozone production result in different substances, with ozone
  obtained by the electrical spark being allotropic oxygen, and ozone produced by
  electrolysis being an oxide of hydrogen.
