revised_title: Further Investigations on the Properties of Electro-Deposited Antimony
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the properties of electro-deposited antimony, focusing
  on the heat evolved during the change in the substance's state. The study concludes
  that the force driving this change is not cohesion, and the specific heat of the
  substance does not significantly change during the process.
