revised_title: Fundamental Views on Mechanics and Rotatory Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author introduces the concept of dyname, a mathematical representation of
  forces and rotatory forces in mechanics, and presents two theorems that form the
  basis of statics. These theorems can be transformed into fundamental theorems of
  mechanics, offering a new perspective on the subject.
