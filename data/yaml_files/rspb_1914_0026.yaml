revised_title: The Bleaching of Chlorophyll in Light
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the effect of light on chlorophyll and finds that it
  rapidly decolorizes chlorophyll solutions, with the bleaching process being most
  effective in the red light spectrum. The study also highlights the importance of
  chlorophyll's role in decomposing carbon dioxide and its potential involvement in
  the photo-synthesis process.
