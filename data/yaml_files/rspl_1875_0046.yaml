revised_title: The Compound Nature of Line Spectra in Elementary Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the line spectra of elementary bodies and finds evidence
  of molecular dissociation in the sun's spectrum. This discovery helps determine
  the electric dissociating conditions equivalent to the degree of dissociation present
  in the sun.
