revised_title: Investigations on the Length of the Voltaic Spark in Different Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the length of the spark produced by a voltaic battery
  in different residual gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures. They find that the
  spark length is longest in hydrogen, followed by nitrogen, air, oxygen, and carbonic
  acid. The spark length is nearly twice as long in hydrogen as in air.
