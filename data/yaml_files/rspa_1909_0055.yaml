revised_title: Investigation of Ion Mobility in Gaseous Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors study the mobility of ions in various gaseous mixtures, including
  ethyl ether and air, using electrical discharges and ionization chambers. They observe
  that the layer of ions broadens out in its passage through the medium and discuss
  the effect of small traces of vapours on the mobility of ions.
