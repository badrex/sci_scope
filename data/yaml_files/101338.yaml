revised_title: Boyle's Experiments on Flame and Air, and Hydrostatic Discourse
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author presents a collection of experiments and discussions on the relationship
  between flame and air, as well as hydrostatic principles. He explores the difficulty
  of producing and maintaining flame without air, the propagation of flame in a vacuum,
  and the pressure of fluids. Additionally, he addresses objections to his previous
  work and provides further insights into hydrostatics and the weight of water.
