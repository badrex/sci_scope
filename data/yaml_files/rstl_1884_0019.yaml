revised_title: Experimental Proof of the Influence of Change of Condition from the
  Liquid to the Solid State on Vapour-Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors provide experimental evidence to support Professor James Thomson's
  theory that the pressure exerted by the vapor of a solid substance is less than
  that of the vapor of the substance in the liquid form at the same temperature. They
  investigate the behavior of camphor, benzene, and acetic acid, demonstrating the
  discontinuity in the vapor-pressure curve at the melting point.
