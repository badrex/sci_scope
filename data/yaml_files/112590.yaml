scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machinery
tldr: The author presents a new apparatus, the parabolic cup, for obtaining uniform
  rotation, which can maintain a constant velocity despite variations in driving power.
  The device is suitable for regulating the speed of various types of machinery and
  has potential applications in telegraphy and steam engine regulation.
