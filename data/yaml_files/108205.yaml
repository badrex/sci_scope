scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the sources of nitrogen in plant growth and evolution,
  conducting experiments on seeds and young plants to determine if the atmosphere
  or soil provides the necessary nutrients. The study finds that plants obtain nitrogen
  from both sources, with the soil containing a higher percentage of nitrogen than
  the atmosphere.
