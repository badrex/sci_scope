revised_title: On the Nature of Forces in Producing Greater Magnetic Disturbances
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the nature of forces responsible for significant magnetic
  disturbances, proposing that earth-currents are induced and secondary phenomena
  rather than the primary cause. The study examines the relationship between earth-currents,
  auroras, and magnetic disturbances, suggesting that these phenomena may follow the
  principle of voltaic induction.
