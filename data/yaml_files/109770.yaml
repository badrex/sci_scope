  Small Objects'

scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering & Instrumentation
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a new method for measuring small
  objects using a single-lens micrometer. The instrument consists of a lens with a
  focus at one-twelfth of an inch, a small perforation for viewing distant objects,
  and a scale of equal parts for measuring objects. The accuracy of the instrument
  depends on the precision of the initial wire measurement, which is made of fine
  gold and determined by weight.
