revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Monochromatic Light Wave-Lengths on Photographic
  Image Gradation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The author investigates how different monochromatic light wave-lengths affect
  the gradation of a developed photographic image. The study finds that the gradation
  becomes steeper as the wave-lengths of light employed depart from the point at which
  the silver salt is most sensitive, with the least steep gradation given by the monochromatic
  light to which the simple silver salt experimented with is most sensitive.
