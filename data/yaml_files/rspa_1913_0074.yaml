revised_title: On Trigonometric Series with Cesàro Partial Summations Oscillating
  Finitely
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates trigonometric series and their Cesàro partial summations,
  proving that if the upper and lower functions of these summations are summable and
  finite, the trigonometric series converges to an integral. This result extends previous
  findings and provides a more comprehensive understanding of Cesàro summation in
  the theory of Fourier series.
