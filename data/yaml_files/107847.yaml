tldr: John Dalton investigates a rare and unusual Aurora Borealis event that occurred
  on March 29, 1826, and collects observations from various locations to determine
  the height of the luminous arch. He concludes that the arch was not at a low altitude,
  challenging previous estimations of the phenomenon's height.
