revised_title: On the Integrability of Partial Differential Equations and the Motion
  of an Elastic Fluid
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Differential Equations
tldr: The author investigates the integrability of partial differential equations,
  specifically those proposed by Airy, and demonstrates a general principle that such
  equations must satisfy a certain equation of condition to admit a solution containing
  arbitrary functions. The author also applies this principle to the motion of an
  elastic fluid, highlighting the limitations of the empirical methods used in its
  analysis.
