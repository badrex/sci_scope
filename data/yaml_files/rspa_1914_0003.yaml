revised_title: The Empirical Determination of Diurnal Terrestrial Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism by analyzing
  data from various observatories. They propose an empirical potential function to
  represent the observed variations and discuss the limitations and implications of
  the findings.
