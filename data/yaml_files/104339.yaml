tldr: Desaguliers conducts electrical experiments using different materials, such
  as glass, sealing wax, and rosin, to demonstrate that the type of electricity is
  not dependent on the material's supporters. He shows that both glass and rosin have
  the same kind of electricity, and that any non-electric conductor can be used as
  long as it is electric.
