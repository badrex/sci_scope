revised_title: On the Polarization of Light and the Blue Colour of the Sky
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the polarization of light and the blue color of the
  sky using a glass tube and various substances. He discovers that the blue cloud
  formed by the interaction of light and certain vapors is polarized, with the direction
  of maximum polarization being at right angles to the illuminating beam. This finding
  sheds light on the enigmatic blue color of the sky and the polarization of skylight.
