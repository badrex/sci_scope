tldr: The author presents a method for investigating fossils using serial sectioning,
  which involves grinding the fossil into thin sections and analyzing them under a
  microscope or through photography. This technique allows for a deeper understanding
  of the fossil's structure and can be applied to various types of fossils, such as
  Graptolites and Ophiurids.
