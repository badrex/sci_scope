revised_title: 'Chemical Brightness of the Sun''s Disc: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author, Henry Enfield Roscoe, investigates the chemical brightness of various
  portions of the Sun's disc using a method of measurement developed with Professor
  Bunsen. The study reveals that the chemical brightness at the center of the Sun's
  disc is three to five times greater than at the edge, with the south polar regions
  having higher chemical brightness than the north polar regions. The research also
  suggests a possible connection between the mottled appearance of sun-pictures and
  the phenomenon of red prominences.
