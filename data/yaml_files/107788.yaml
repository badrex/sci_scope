revised_title: Investigating the Convertibility and Reduction to Vacuum of Captain
  Kater's Pendulum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Mechanics
tldr: Edward Sabine investigates Captain Kater's convertible pendulum and its reduction
  to a vacuum. He discovers that the pendulum's convertibility is affected by the
  medium and that the amount of air retardation is greater than previously computed.
  Sabine also finds that using wooden tail pieces can cause errors in the experiment
  due to changes in moisture content.
