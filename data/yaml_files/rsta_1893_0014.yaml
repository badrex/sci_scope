revised_title: 'Photographic Spectra of Some Brighter Stars: A Study of Stellar Evolution'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Evolution
tldr: The author investigates the photographic spectra of brighter stars and discusses
  their classification based on their spectra. The study suggests that celestial bodies,
  such as stars, comets, and nebulae, may be swarms of meteorites with differences
  based on condensation. The research proposes a new classification of heavenly bodies
  according to their spectra, which includes bodies of increasing and decreasing temperature,
  challenging previous hypotheses.
