revised_title: Phase Equilibria and Microstructure of Gold-Aluminum Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This study investigates the phase equilibria and microstructure of gold-aluminum
  alloys. The authors determine the equilibrium curve for the liquid alloys and the
  solid bodies that can form in them. They identify seven substances in the solid
  alloys and three eutectic points. The research also examines the microscopic structure
  of the alloys and compares the effectiveness of surface photographs and Röntgen-ray
  photographs in revealing the alloy's structure.
