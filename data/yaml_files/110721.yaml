revised_title: Joule's Experiments on the Calorific Effects of Voltaic Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Thermal Physics
tldr: Joule investigates the relationship between the amount of heat produced by voltaic
  electricity and the resistance of the circuit. He finds that the heat generated
  is proportional to the resistance and in the duplicate ratio of the quantity of
  electricity transmitted, suggesting that the efficiency of energy conversion is
  dependent on the resistance of the circuit.
