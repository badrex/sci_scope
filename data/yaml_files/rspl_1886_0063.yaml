  of Metals

scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Solid State Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of magnetization on the elasticity and internal
  friction of metals through torsional oscillation experiments. They find that sustained
  longitudinal magnetization has little effect on internal friction when deformations
  are small, but significantly increases it when deformations are large. The study
  also reveals that the torsional elasticity is not affected by sustained magnetization
  when deformations are small.
