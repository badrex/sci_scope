revised_title: 'Investigation of the Wave Surface of Quartz: Form and Retardation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Crystal Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the form of the wave surface of quartz using a spectrometer
  and determine the distance between the two wave sheets from the axis to the equator.
  Their findings provide a more accurate measure of the difference in wave velocities
  and contribute to the understanding of the wave surface's form and properties.
