revised_title: Theory of Luminosity Produced in Certain Substances by Alpha-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the decay of luminosity produced by alpha-rays in zinc
  sulfide, willemite, and barium platinocyanide. The theory suggests that the decay
  of luminosity is due to the destruction of active centers in the material, which
  are ionized and dissociated by alpha-particles. The intensity of scintillations
  decreases as the number of active centers is reduced, in agreement with experimental
  results.
