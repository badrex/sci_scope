scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the density of helium extracted from various minerals,
  including cleveite, broggerite, samarskite, and fergusonite. The density of helium
  varies depending on the mineral source, with cleveite yielding the highest density
  and fergusonite yielding the lowest. The study provides insight into the composition
  and properties of these minerals and the gaseous constituents they contain.
