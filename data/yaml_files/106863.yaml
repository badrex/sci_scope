revised_title: On Infinite Series and Their Convergence
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author discusses the use of infinite series in mathematics, particularly
  in finding the area under curves and solving algebraic equations. He also explores
  the conditions for convergence of these series and provides methods for determining
  when they will converge or diverge.
