revised_title: On the Deviation from Stokes' Law for the Velocity of Fall of Spherical
  Particles in Fluid Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the deviation from Stokes' Law for the velocity of fall
  of spherical particles in fluid media. They find that the deviation is extremely
  small for particles with dimensions experimented upon and provide a modified formula
  for lower pressures or smaller dimensions. They also consider the effect of simultaneous
  presence of multiple particles moving through the fluid and the influence of particle
  boundaries.
