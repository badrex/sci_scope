scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the stapes bone, a component
  of the auditory system, in various animals. The stapes plays a crucial role in transmitting
  sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The study provides insights
  into the similarities and differences in the stapes bone across different species
  and its importance in understanding hearing mechanisms.
