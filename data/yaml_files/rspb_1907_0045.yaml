revised_title: The Origin and Development of Granules in Leucocytes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Cytology
tldr: The author investigates the formation and development of granules in leucocytes,
  discovering that they originate from a thread-like structure in the archoplasm.
  This thread grows and eventually breaks up to form the granules, with the staining
  properties of the granules changing from basic to acid in some cases.
