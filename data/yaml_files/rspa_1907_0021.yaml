revised_title: Thermomagnetic Analysis of Meteoric and Artificial Nickel-Iron Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic properties and composition of meteoric
  and artificial nickel-iron alloys through thermomagnetic analysis. They find that
  meteoric iron is primarily composed of a nickel-iron alloy containing between 6-7%
  nickel, with a small amount of a complex alloy containing 25-30% nickel. The study
  also reveals the existence of a eutectic containing about 27% nickel in the nickel-iron
  series, which is significant in the theory of nickel steels.
