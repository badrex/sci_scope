scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The authors explore Abel's theorem and its connection to Abelian functions,
  providing a more general form of the theorem and discussing its applications, including
  the addition-theorem for Abelian functions and the use of integral functions.
