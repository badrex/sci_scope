revised_title: The Physiological Action of Paraffinic Nitrites and Their Chemical
  Constitution
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: The authors investigate the physiological effects of paraffinic nitrites on
  blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. They find that nitrites cause a fall in
  blood pressure due to the dilatation of arterioles, and discuss the possible causes
  of this dilatation, whether it is a direct action on the vaso-motor centers or on
  the walls of the vessels.
