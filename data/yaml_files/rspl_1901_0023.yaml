tldr: The discovery of a new star in Perseus is reported, and its spectrum is analyzed.
  The star's spectrum contains numerous dark lines and several bright bands, resembling
  the spectrum of Nova Aurigae. The analysis suggests that the star's characteristics
  align with the meteoritic hypothesis and its position on the temperature curve.
  The study provides insights into the nature of new stars and their evolution.
