  Polygons
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the analytical properties of the porism of in-and-circumscribed
  polygons, focusing on the relationship between the discriminant of two conics and
  the coefficients of the polygons. The study provides a new perspective on the geometric
  properties of polygons and their analytical representation.
