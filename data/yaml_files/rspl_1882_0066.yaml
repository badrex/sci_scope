revised_title: Electromagnetic Tuning Forks and the Development of a Uniform Rotation
  Machine
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Acoustics
tldr: The author presents a uniform rotation machine and explores the theory of electromagnetic
  tuning forks. The machine aims to construct standard notes and accurately determine
  the pitch of tuning forks. The author also outlines a theory for the motion of electromagnetic
  tuning forks, which depends on the time of magnetization of the magnetic system.
