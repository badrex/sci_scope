revised_title: 'A Portable Telemeter: Improving Range-Finding Accuracy'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author presents a portable telemeter, or range-finder, that uses double
  reflection at each end of the base to overcome the need for extreme accuracy in
  the rigidity of the base. This innovation allows for improved portability and accuracy
  in measuring distances, making it useful for military applications and long-distance
  tests.
