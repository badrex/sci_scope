revised_title: 'Scattering of Light by Solid Substances: Experiments with Quartz and
  Glass'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the scattering of light by solid substances, focusing
  on quartz and glass. The study reveals that the scattering is mainly due to inclusions
  in the materials, which cause polarization and coloration. Clear quartz exhibits
  less scattering than other materials, while colored or smoky quartz has a stronger
  scattering effect.
