revised_title: Cell Lamination and Fiber Enumeration in the Cerebral Cortex of Echidna
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the cell lamination of the cerebral cortex in an echidna
  and provides an enumeration of the fibers in the cranial nerves. The study is based
  on the analysis of a series of transverse sections of the brain, stained with polychrome
  blue, and mounted for observation. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of the structure and organization of the echidna's brain.
