revised_title: On Surface Forces Caused by Evaporation and Condensation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the forces caused by evaporation and condensation on
  a surface, providing evidence for the kinetic theory of gases. The experiments demonstrate
  that evaporation creates a force tending to drive the surface back, while condensation
  creates a force tending to draw the surface forward. The findings have implications
  for understanding the behavior of gases and the forces acting on surfaces.
