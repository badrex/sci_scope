revised_title: Investigating the Induction of Magnetism by Electrical Currents in
  Iron Bars
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Joule's experiments investigate the relationship between the induction of magnetism
  and electrical currents in iron bars of varying diameters. He found that the magnetic
  set, or the permanent change in magnetism, follows a different law than the magnetic
  action under the influence of the current. The magnetic set increases nearly proportionally
  to the square of the current in bars of smaller diameters, but the ratio is diminished
  in thicker bars.
