  II
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the fluorescence and resonance of sodium vapor using
  a sodium vacuum arc and a quartz spectrograph. The study focuses on the excitation
  of the D line and the principal series of sodium, providing insights into the re-emission
  of specific wavelengths and the behavior of the sodium vapor under different conditions.
