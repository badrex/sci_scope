scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of the ascidian mouth, concluding
  that a significant portion of the oral siphon's epithelium is derived from the primitive
  neural tube of the embryo. The study provides insight into the morphogenesis and
  anatomy of ascidians, as well as the connection between the neural tube and ectoderm.
