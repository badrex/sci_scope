revised_title: Description of a Hydropneumatic Baroscope for Measuring Altitude
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author describes a hydropneumatic baroscope that uses the principle of hydrostatics
  to measure altitude by determining the difference in air pressure at varying elevations.
  The instrument, which consists of a floating brass cone, can estimate altitude by
  measuring the change in volume of air within the cone as it is subjected to changes
  in pressure.
