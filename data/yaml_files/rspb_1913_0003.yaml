revised_title: 'The Metabolism of Lactating Women: A Study on Creatin Excretion and
  Milk Production'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Nutrition & Metabolism
tldr: This study investigates the metabolism of lactating women, specifically the
  excretion of creatin and its relation to milk production. The research found that
  creatin excretion is not directly related to the development of milk secretion,
  suggesting that the liver may play a key role in the metabolic changes during lactation.
