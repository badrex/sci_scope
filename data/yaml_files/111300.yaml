tldr: This memoir by Arthur Cayley investigates various aspects of caustics, focusing
  on the mathematical properties of caustics formed by refraction and reflection of
  rays. The author discusses several cases, including the caustic by refraction of
  a circle, the caustic by reflection of a circle, and the secondary caustic or orthogonal
  trajectory of the reflected or refracted rays. The study also explores the relationship
  between the caustic and the secondary caustic, and the curve formed when incident
  rays are parallel.
