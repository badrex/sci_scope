scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ornithology & Bird Behavior
tldr: The author presents evidence that swallows and martins remain in a torpid state
  during the winter, rather than being migratory birds. He shares observations of
  martins found in a torpid state in November and December, and discusses the possibility
  of these birds seeking warmer climates during the winter months.
