scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the value of the definite integral involving Legendre's
  coefficients and demonstrates an inductive process to establish the formula for
  the product of any two coefficients. The study has implications for integral calculus
  and mathematical analysis.
