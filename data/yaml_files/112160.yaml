revised_title: Development of Striated Muscular Fibre in Different Species
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the development of striated muscular fibers in various
  species, including tadpoles, chicks, sheep, and humans. The study reveals that muscle
  growth begins with the elongation of cells and multiplication of their nuclei, followed
  by fibrillation and striation of their contents. The author also discusses the role
  of the sarcolemma and the similarities between his findings and other researchers'
  views.
