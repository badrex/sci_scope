  in Hydrogen Gas
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Synthesis
tldr: Schoenbein discovers a new bleaching principle produced by the slow combustion
  of ether in atmospheric air and rapid combustion of substances in a jet of hydrogen
  gas. This principle has oxidizing properties and can decompose various compounds,
  similar to chlorine and ozone.
