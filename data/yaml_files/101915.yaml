  Springs
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Oceanography
tldr: The author presents a theory on the circulation of watery vapors in the sea
  and the formation of springs. He explains how warmth separates water particles and
  raises vapors, which are then carried by the wind to mountains where they condense
  into springs. The author also discusses the role of rivers and the impact of weather
  on the process.
