revised_title: 'Occlusion of Hydrogen Gas by Meteoric Iron: A Study on the Origin
  of Iron'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteoritics & Planetary Science
tldr: The author investigates the occlusion of hydrogen gas in meteoric iron, specifically
  Lenarto iron, and finds that it contains a higher percentage of hydrogen than malleable
  iron. This suggests that meteoric iron may have originated from a dense hydrogen-rich
  atmosphere beyond the solar system.
