revised_title: 'On the Reflexion of Polarized Light from Polished Surfaces: Optical
  Constants and Properties of Metals and Alloys'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, investigates the reflection of polarized light
  from polished surfaces and determines the optical constants of various transparent
  bodies, metals, and alloys. The study reveals interesting properties and relationships
  between the substances, with silver possessing the highest brilliancy and lustre,
  and copper and gold having high lustre but lower brilliancy.
