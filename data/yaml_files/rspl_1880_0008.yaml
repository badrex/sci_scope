scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of aleurone-grains in various
  plants, identifying different types of proteins and globulins present in these grains.
  The study provides a classification of aleurone-grains based on their solubility
  in water and sodium chloride solutions.
