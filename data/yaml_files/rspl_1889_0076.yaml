revised_title: 'Effects of Training Walls in Estuaries: A Study on the Mersey Estuary'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Geotechnics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of training walls on estuaries, specifically
  in the Mersey estuary, through a series of experiments using a working model. They
  find that training walls in the upper estuary lead to accretion and deterioration
  of the channel below, while training walls in the lower estuary improve the depth
  of the outlet channel.
