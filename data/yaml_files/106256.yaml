revised_title: Comparing the Performance of Air-Pump Gages
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Instrumentation
tldr: The author compares the performance of different air-pump gages, including the
  pear-gage and barometer gages, and finds discrepancies in their measurements of
  air pressure. The experiments reveal that the pear-gage overestimates the degree
  of air exhaustion, suggesting improvements are needed for accurate measurements.
