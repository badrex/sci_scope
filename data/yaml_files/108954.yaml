tldr: The author presents the results of magnetic observations at the Kew Observatory,
  focusing on the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic elements. The study reveals
  a systematic and regular variation that indicates the existence of a general law
  governing the moon's influence on Earth's magnetism. The findings show a strong
  correspondence with observations at other locations, such as Hobarton, and encourage
  further research in this field.
