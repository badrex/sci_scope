revised_title: Further Investigations on Fluoric Compounds and Their Chemical Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Compounds
tldr: In this paper, Sir H. Davy presents new experiments on fluoric compounds and
  their decomposition, discussing the composition of fluates, the decomposition of
  silica, and the similarities between the siliceous and boracic bases. He also explores
  the properties of fluoric acids and their reactions with various substances, contributing
  to the understanding of chemical philosophy.
