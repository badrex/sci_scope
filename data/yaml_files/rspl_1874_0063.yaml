scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geophysics
tldr: Robert Mallet defends his theory on the mechanism of Stromboli's eruptions against
  critics who argue that his measurements are inaccurate. Mallet emphasizes that his
  theory does not rely on the proximity of the crater's fundus to the sea-level and
  that the proposed mechanism can work with different tube lengths.
