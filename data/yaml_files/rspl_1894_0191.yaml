revised_title: 'Poisson''s Ratio and Torsion Experiments: A Comparison'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author compares Poisson's ratio obtained from direct measurement to that
  found by comparing torsion and tension experiments, concluding that they are fairly
  reliable and may be useful for those researching elasticity.
