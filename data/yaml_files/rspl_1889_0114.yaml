revised_title: The Influence of the Spectrum on Silver Halide Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of the spectrum on silver halide salts and
  find that the salts' optical properties change when exposed to different wavelengths
  of light. This discovery has implications for the development of photographic film
  and spectral analysis techniques.
