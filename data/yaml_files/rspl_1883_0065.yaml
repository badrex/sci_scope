scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Humpidge and Frankland respond to Reynolds' note on the atomic weight of glucinum
  or beryllium, discussing specific heat and the purity of the metal. They also mention
  the possibility of glucinum being an exception to Dulong and Petit's law of atomic
  heats or Mendeleeff's periodic law.
