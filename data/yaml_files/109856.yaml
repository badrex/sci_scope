revised_title: Discovery of a Native Iron Mass in Brazil
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author describes the discovery of a large native iron mass in Brazil and
  its subsequent examination. The iron block was found to be highly magnetic, with
  its north pole pointing in a northeastern direction. However, separated fragments
  did not possess magnetic poles. A small portion of the iron was dissolved and tested
  for the presence of nickel, with inconclusive results. The surrounding area is described,
  including prismatic fragments, basalt balls, sandstone hills, and warm springs.
