revised_title: A Simplified Table for Suspension Bridges Computations
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering
tldr: Davies Gilbert presents a new table that simplifies calculations for suspension
  bridge engineering, supplementing the 1826 paper 'On the Mathematical Theory of
  Suspension Bridges.' The table provides more practical applications for investigating
  various aspects of suspension bridges.
topics:
- Suspension Bridges
- Mathematical Theory
- Engineering
- Deflections
- Tensions
