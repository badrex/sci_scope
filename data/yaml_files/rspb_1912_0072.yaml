revised_title: The Effect of Carbohydrates and Neutralizing Agents on Nitrogen Fixation
  by Aerobic Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The study investigates the influence of different carbohydrates and neutralizing
  agents on nitrogen fixation by aerobic organisms, specifically Azotobacter and Pseudomonas.
  Dextrin is found to be an effective source of energy for both organisms, and basic
  slag proves to be a better neutralizing agent than chalk, with a stimulative effect
  on nitrogen fixation nearly equal to that of humus.
