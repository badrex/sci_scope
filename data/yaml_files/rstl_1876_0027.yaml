revised_title: On the Internal Forces Acting on a Radiometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Arthur Schuster and Balfour Stewart investigate the forces acting on a radiometer,
  concluding that the motion is due to internal forces between the radiometer and
  its enclosure, with no direct force from radiation. Their experiments provide evidence
  that the motion of the radiometer is not caused by external forces related to radiation.
