revised_title: 'Anomalous Magnetic Action of Hot Iron: Exploring the Transition from
  White to Blood-Red Heat'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of iron at different temperatures,
  particularly the anomalous action between the white and blood-red heat. The study
  reveals that the iron's magnetic attraction changes its direction during this temperature
  range, and the findings help reconcile previously contradictory statements on the
  subject.
