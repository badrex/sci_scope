revised_title: A Comprehensive Study of Spectral Series in Monatomic Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the properties of spectral series in monatomic gases,
  focusing on the relationships between sequences and the role of the 'oun' constant
  in determining series relations. The research also explores the prevalence of linkages
  and displacements in spark and vacuum tube spectra.
topics:
- Spectral Series
- Rare Gases
- Atomic Spectroscopy
- Spectral Sequences
- Spectral Analysis
