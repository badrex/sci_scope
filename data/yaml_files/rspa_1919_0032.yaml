revised_title: Investigating the Transmission of Electric Waves Around the Earth
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Waves
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of electric waves around the Earth,
  considering the Earth as a conductor surrounded by a concentric reflecting layer.
  The study suggests that this layer, also known as Heaviside's layer, can affect
  the transmission of signals and poses challenges for communication with other planets.

- Electromagnetic Waves
- Earth's Atmosphere
