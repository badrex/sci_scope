revised_title: Correction and Clarification of Errors in 'On the Stresses in the Interior
  of Earth by the Weight of Continents and Mountains'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodynamics & Tectonophysics
tldr: The author corrects errors in a previous paper on the stresses within the Earth's
  interior due to the weight of continents and mountains. The corrections do not affect
  the physical conclusions, but clarify the methodology and assumptions used. The
  author also provides additional insights into the stress distribution and the effects
  of zonal harmonics on the Earth's deformation.
