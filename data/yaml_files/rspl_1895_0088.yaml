revised_title: Investigating the Discharge of Electricity by Röntgen Rays and Their
  Effects on Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: J.J. Thomson investigates the discharge of electricity when Röntgen rays interact
  with electrified bodies and dielectrics. He finds that these rays can cause a rapid
  discharge of both positive and negative charges, and that they can make dielectrics
  conductive, suggesting a molecular splitting process.
