revised_title: 'On the Change of Refrangibility of Light: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author describes a new method of observing the change of refrangibility
  of light using absorbing media, which can be used to detect fluorescence and improve
  color perception. This method can be employed by chemists to differentiate between
  various substances and enhance their observations.
