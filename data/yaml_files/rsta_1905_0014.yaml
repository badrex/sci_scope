scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the convergence of infinite series of analytic functions
  defined by linear differential equations of the second order, with examples of Lame,
  Bessel, and Legendre functions. The study explores the expansion of a function in
  a series of hypergeometric functions and the conditions for convergence.

- Differential Equations
- Analytic Functions
- Series Convergence
- Function Expansion
- Hypergeometric Functions
