revised_title: Ionisation Potentials of Magnesium and Absorption Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the ionisation potentials of magnesium and its absorption
  spectrum. They find that magnesium vapour absorbs light at specific wavelengths,
  specifically at 2852.22 Å and 2026.46 Å, and discuss the implications of these findings
  on the understanding of magnesium's atomic structure.
