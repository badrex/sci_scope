revised_title: On the Stereoscopic and Pseudoscopic Effects in the Camera Obscura
scientific_discipline: Optics & Light
scientific_subdiscipline: Imaging & Visualization
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of relief in images formed on the ground
  glass of the camera obscura and discovers that each eye perceives a different image,
  resulting in a stereoscopic effect. The author also explains the difference between
  stereoscopic and pseudoscopic effects and proposes a new method for constructing
  a stereoscope using a single image composed of two images with different perspectives.
