revised_title: 'Urease: A Selective Enzyme and the Influence of Accelerative and Inhibitive
  Agents'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the selective enzyme urease and its activity in the
  presence of various substances, including acids, carboxy-acids, and other compounds.
  They find that certain substances, such as boric acid and phenol, inhibit the enzyme's
  action, while others, like glycine and asparagine, accelerate it. The study provides
  insights into the complex interactions between enzymes and their surrounding environment.
topics:
- Enzyme action
- Urease
- Inhibitive agents
- Accelerative agents
- Chemical kinetics
