revised_title: Correcting Errors in Linear Measure Due to Bar Thickness
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Measurement & Metrology
tldr: The author, Henry Kater, investigates the errors in linear measurement standards
  caused by the thickness of the bar they are traced on. He describes experiments
  and a new scale design to minimize this error. Kater also introduces a method to
  detect surface irregularities using a piano-wire and a bow.
