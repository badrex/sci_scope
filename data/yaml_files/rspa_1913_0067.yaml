revised_title: Investigating the Electric Effect of Rotating a Magnetic Insulator
  in a Magnetic Field
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the electric effect of rotating a magnetic insulator
  in a magnetic field and find that the induced electromotive force is nearly proportional
  to the current and the number of revolutions per second. The results are compared
  to those in a conductor, considering the induction and corrections for induced electromotive
  forces in the metal.
