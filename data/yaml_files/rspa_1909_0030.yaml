revised_title: 'Syntonic Wireless Telegraphy: A New Approach to Tuning and Selective
  Reception'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Telecommunications & Wireless Systems
tldr: The authors propose a new method for tuning and selective reception in wireless
  telegraphy, known as the syntonic system. This system uses self-contained vibrators
  and avoids the use of the earth as a terminal, allowing for better tuning and selective
  reception of messages without interference from other stations.
