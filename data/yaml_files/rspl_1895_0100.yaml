revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Röntgen X-Rays on Contact Electricity of
  Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the impact of Röntgen X-rays on the contact electricity
  of metals using zinc and tinfoil plates. The results show that the X-rays can affect
  the contact potential difference between the plates, suggesting a potential application
  in measuring the properties of X-rays.
