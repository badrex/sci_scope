revised_title: 'The Electrical Ignition of Gaseous Mixtures: An Investigation into
  the Role of Ionization in Spark Ignition'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the ignition of gaseous mixtures using electric sparks
  and examines the role of ionization in the process. The author finds that the energy
  required to ignite a gas is much higher when using alternating current compared
  to continuous current, suggesting that the ignition process is not solely thermal.
  The results indicate that the igniting effect is proportional to the current when
  it is unidirectional, supporting the idea that ionization plays a significant role
  in the ignition process.
