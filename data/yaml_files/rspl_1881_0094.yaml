tldr: This paper explores the properties of theta-functions, particularly those with
  two variables, and their applications in mathematical analysis. The author presents
  a comprehensive study of Rosenhain's theory, double theta-functions, and quadruple
  periodicity, providing new insights and expressions for these functions.
