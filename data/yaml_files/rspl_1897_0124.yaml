revised_title: The Absence of Suprarenal Medulla in Teleostean Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the effects of extirpation of the suprarenal bodies
  in eels and finds that they can survive longer without these bodies compared to
  mammals and frogs. This suggests that the cortical suprarenal gland in Teleostean
  fishes is not absolutely essential to the life of the animal, unlike in higher vertebrates.
