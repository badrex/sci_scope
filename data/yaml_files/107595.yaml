revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author, John Pond, investigates the parallax of fixed stars using a new
  method involving fixed telescopes. He observes the star a Cygni and compares it
  with other stars, concluding that the discordances previously attributed to parallax
  must have had another cause. The observations provide evidence that the mean place
  of a star is never deranged by parallax more than one-tenth of a second.
