scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolution
tldr: The author examines fossilized specimens of Sphenopteris elegans and discusses
  the unique bark-like structures found on the stems of Heterangiums. These findings
  suggest that Heterangiums may have been ancestral forms with exogenous stems and
  fern-like foliage, potentially influencing the evolution of modern Cycads and Ferns.
