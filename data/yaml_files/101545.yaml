scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Biology & Anatomy
tldr: This article presents two case studies of elderly individuals who experienced
  tooth regeneration. Joseph Shute, aged 81, noticed a new tooth growing in his upper
  jaw, while Maria Stert, aged 75, had two new teeth grow in her mouth after being
  toothless for 25 years. Both individuals reported no pain during the process, and
  the new teeth were functional. The article is supported by signatures from the subjects
  and witnesses, including Sir William Strode and Mr. Colepresse.
