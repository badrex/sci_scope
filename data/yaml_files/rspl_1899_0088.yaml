  A Preliminary Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: This article investigates the origin and development of plant cell walls and
  connecting threads, proposing that the cell plate arises indirectly from spindle
  fibers and that the cell wall is fundamentally a mucilage secretion. The author
  suggests that further research will help solidify these views on plant cell wall
  structure and growth.
