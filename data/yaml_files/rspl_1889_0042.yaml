revised_title: Temperature and Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the specific inductive
  capacity of various dielectrics, including mica, ebonite, glass, turpentine, carbon
  bisulphide, glycerine, benzoline, benzine, olive oil, and paraffin oil. They find
  that the rate of increase in specific inductive capacity varies for each substance
  and discuss the results in relation to the electromagnetic theory of light and refractive
  index.
