revised_title: Advancements in Photographic Method for Mapping the Least Refrangible
  End of the Solar Spectrum

scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: Captain W. de W. Abney investigates the use of dyes in photography to enhance
  the visibility of the least refrangible end of the solar spectrum. He discovers
  that certain dyes, when combined with silver bromide, can create a more sensitive
  film that captures the spectrum more accurately. This method allows for better mapping
  of the solar spectrum and extends the range of visible light that can be captured
  on film.
