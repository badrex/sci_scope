revised_title: Hydrolysis of Isomeric Glucosides and Galactosides by Acids and Enzymes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The author investigates the hydrolysis of isomeric glucosides and galactosides
  by acids and enzymes, finding that a-Methyl glucoside and /3-Methyl glucoside are
  more stable than their corresponding galactosides. The study also reveals that a
  change in the configuration at the fourth carbon atom significantly affects the
  activity of the associated group, suggesting that the oxygen atom in the pentaphane
  ring may be the attractive center.
