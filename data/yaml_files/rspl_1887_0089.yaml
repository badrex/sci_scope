revised_title: Investigating Sewer Air and Its Impurities
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Chemistry & Microbiology
tldr: The authors examine the air quality in sewers, analyzing the levels of carbonic
  acid, organic matter, and microorganisms. They conclude that the air in sewers is
  generally better than expected, and that the sources of impurities are mainly due
  to the oxidation of organic matter in sewage and the infiltration of outside air.
  The authors also emphasize the importance of proper sewer ventilation and drainage
  systems to minimize the spread of microorganisms.
