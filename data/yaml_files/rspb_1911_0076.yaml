revised_title: Investigating the Permeability of the Yeast-Cell and its Osmotic Behavior
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Cell Biology
tldr: This study investigates the permeability of yeast-cells and their osmotic behavior
  towards substances that influence alcoholic fermentation. The author examines the
  effects of various substances, such as phosphates, arsenites, and arsenates, on
  yeast-juice and living yeast, and explores the diffusion and plasmolysis of yeast-cells
  in different solutions. The results provide insights into the factors affecting
  the permeability and behavior of yeast-cells, which is essential for understanding
  fermentation processes.
