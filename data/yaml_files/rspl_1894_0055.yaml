revised_title: Specific Heats of Carbon Dioxide at Constant Volume
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the specific heats of carbon dioxide at constant volume,
  expanding the range of experiments to include densities where the substance is partly
  in the liquid state. The mean specific heat at a density of 0.01444 is determined
  to be 0.2035. The results provide a well-defined line that rises slowly at higher
  densities, and an empirical equation is given for the specific heat of carbon dioxide
  at constant volume.
