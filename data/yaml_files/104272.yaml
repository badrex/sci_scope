tldr: Two separate observations of mysterious air explosions are documented, one by
  Reverend A. Vievar in Halsted, Essex, and the other by Sam. Shepheard in Springfield,
  Essex. Both events occurred on clear days with no visible clouds. The phenomena
  were characterized by loud noises, visible disturbances in the air and water, and
  physical effects such as the tossing of objects and damage to trees and structures.
  The events' causes and nature remain unexplained.
