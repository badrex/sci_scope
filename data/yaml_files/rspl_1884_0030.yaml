revised_title: The Relation between Electric Energy and Radiation in the Spectrum
  of Incandescent Lamps
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between electric energy and radiation
  in incandescent lamps, discovering that the curves for refrangibility lower than
  about 7000 Ã… are hyperbolas, and when near the limit of visibility, they approach
  the parabolic form. They also compare the radiation of a platinum wire lamp with
  a carbon filament lamp.
