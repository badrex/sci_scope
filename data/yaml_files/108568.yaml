revised_title: 'Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion: A Study on the Efficiency of
  Porous Plugs'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: This paper investigates the thermal effects of fluids in motion, specifically
  focusing on the efficiency of porous plugs in reducing heat loss during experiments.
  The authors propose a method to determine the value of p, Carnot's function, and
  discuss the apparatus used in their experiments, which includes a pump, nozzles,
  and plugs of porous material.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Thermal Efficiency
- Porous Materials
- Heat Transfer
- Gas Compression
