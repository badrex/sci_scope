tldr: The author examines the strength and properties of various purging waters, focusing
  on Jessop's Well Water. He finds that the water near the bottom of the well is stronger

  regular oblong crystals. The water is also effective in treating obstinate scurvy
  and has a positive impact on patients' health when consumed steadily and cautiously.
