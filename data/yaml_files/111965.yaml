revised_title: Temperature Influence on Electric Conducting Power of Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Field
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the electric conducting
  power of various metals and metalloids. They find that the conducting power of metals
  in a solid state varies similarly between 0°C and 100°C, while metalloids exhibit
  different behavior, conducting electricity better when heated.
