tldr: Dr. Brook Taylor and Mr. Hawkesbee conducted an experiment using the great loadstone
  belonging to the Royal Society to discover the law of magnetic attraction. They
  found that the variations of a needle from its natural position were directly related
  to the distance from the loadstone's extremity, providing insight into the nature
  of magnetic attraction.
