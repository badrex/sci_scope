revised_title: 'Electrical Changes in the Beating Frog''s Heart: A Preliminary Communication'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the electrical changes in the beating frog's heart using
  a capillary electrometer and discovers that the electrical changes in the frog's
  heart in situ are similar to those observed in mammalian hearts. The study also
  reveals a return wave of activity from the apex to the base, which contributes to
  the extensive terminal phase of the electromotive effect in the beating heart.
