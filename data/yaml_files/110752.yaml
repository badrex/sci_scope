  and Rosewall Hill Mines'

tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted by William Jory Henwood on the electric
  conditions of rocks and metalliferous veins in Longclose and Rosewall Hill Mines
  in Cornwall. The experiments aimed to determine if imperfections in the galvanometers
  or other apparatus used by previous experimenters, such as R. W. Fox, were the reason
  for their inability to detect electricity in tin veins. The results show that both
  granite and tin veins at Rosewall Hill mine, as well as greenstone and copper veins
  in Longclose mine, exhibit clear signs of electric currents. The nature and position
  of the small metallic plates used in the experiments significantly affect the intensity
  and direction of the currents, and there is a noticeable difference in results when
  the same metal plates are placed on different ingredients in the veins, even if
  they are in direct contact.
