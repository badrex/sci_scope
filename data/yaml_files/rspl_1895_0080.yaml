  to Nerves, Drugs, and Animal Extracts

scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors, E. A. Sch√§fer and B. Moore, investigate the rhythmic contractility
  of the spleen and its response to nerves, drugs, and animal extracts. They use a
  specially constructed plethysmograph to study the spleen's volume changes and find
  that it responds to alterations in blood pressure and respiratory and cardiac changes.
  They also discover that certain drugs and animal extracts, such as curare, suprarenal
  extract, and brain extract, can excite the spleen's contractions. The authors conclude
  that the spleen's contractions are independent of the central nervous system and
  that the splanchnics contain nerve fibers that cause both contraction and dilatation
  of the spleen.
