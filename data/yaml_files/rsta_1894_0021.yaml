revised_title: 'Flame Spectra at High Temperatures: The Bessemer Process and Thermo-Chemistry'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the flame spectra of the Bessemer process and discovers
  that the spectrum is not solely due to carbon or carbonic oxide. The presence of
  manganese and other elements in the iron contributes to the spectrum, making it
  challenging to use the spectroscope as a practical indicator for decarburization
  in the process.
