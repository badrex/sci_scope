revised_title: The Influence of Molecular Weight and Chemical Composition on Transfer-Resistance
  in Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between transfer-resistance and molecular
  weight and chemical composition of electrolytes. The study reveals that transfer-resistance
  varies inversely with atomic weights of electropositive and electronegative elements
  in the electrolyte, and is related to surface tension and corrosion of electrodes.
