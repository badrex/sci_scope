revised_title: A New Approach to Upper and Lower Integration
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The authors explore a new approach to upper and lower integration, introducing
  the concept of generalized upper and lower summations. They demonstrate that the
  lower limit of these summations can be used to define the upper integral, and the
  upper limit can be used to define the lower integral. This new approach is extended
  to measurable sets, providing a more general definition of integration.
