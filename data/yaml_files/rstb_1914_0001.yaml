scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates the comparative anatomy and potential relationships
  of the Araucarineae family, focusing on their leaf gaps and secondary wood structure.
  The study supports the connection between Araucarineae and Cordaitean forms, rather
  than Lycopod ancestry, based on the retention of primitive organization and anatomical
  features.
