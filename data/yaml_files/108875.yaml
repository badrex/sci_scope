scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors, William Huggins and W.A. Miller, describe their efforts to analyze
  the spectra of fixed stars using a specially designed apparatus. They discuss the
  difficulties they faced due to the Earth's atmosphere and the feebleness of starlight.
  Their observations led to the identification of dark lines in the spectra of stars,
  similar to those found in the solar spectrum, which they attribute to the presence
  of specific elements.
