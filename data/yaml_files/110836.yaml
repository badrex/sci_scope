revised_title: Observations on Animal Heat and Temperature in Old Age
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author presents various observations on animal heat, including the temperature
  of fish, elderly individuals, and the effects of different temperatures on animal
  bodies. He concludes that the temperature of old persons is rather above than below
  that of persons of middle age, and that exercise has a minimal impact on the heat
  of central and deep-seated body parts.
