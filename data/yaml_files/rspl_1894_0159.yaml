revised_title: A New Instrument for Accurately Cutting, Grinding, and Polishing Section-Plates
  and Prisms of Minerals and Crystals
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The authors present a new instrument for cutting, grinding, and polishing section-plates
  and prisms of mineral or other crystals accurately in the desired directions. The
  instrument is designed for mineralogists but can also serve the purposes of the
  smaller instrument previously described. It features a cutting apparatus, a larger
  grinding table with interchangeable laps, and improved crystal holders with cross-grooved
  surfaces and protecting rims.
