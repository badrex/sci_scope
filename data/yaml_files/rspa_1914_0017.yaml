revised_title: Investigating the Production of Neon and Helium through Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author attempts to observe the production of neon and helium through electric
  discharge, but finds no conclusive evidence of their production. The experiments
  focus on minimizing atmospheric contamination and improving the sensitivity of the
  detection methods.
topics:
- Electric Discharge
- Gas Spectroscopy
- Charcoal Absorption
- Atmospheric Contamination
- Helium and Neon Detection
