revised_title: Experimental Observations on Early Degenerative Changes in Muscle Spindles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neuromuscular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the early degenerative changes in sensory end organs
  of muscles, specifically muscle spindles, after nerve section in dogs. They observe
  changes in the spiral nerve termination and the large intramuscular cells within
  24 to 48 hours, and discuss the implications of these findings in relation to tabes
  dorsalis in humans.
