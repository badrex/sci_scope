revised_title: 'The Effects of Temperature and Pressure on the Thermal Conductivities
  of Solids: Part II - The Effect of Low Temperatures on the Thermal Conductivities
  of Pure Metals and Alloys'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature and pressure on the thermal
  conductivities of solids, specifically focusing on pure metals and alloys at low
  temperatures. The research expands upon previous work by Lorenz, Jager, and Diesselhorst,
  providing a wider range of temperature comparison for thermal and electrical conductivities.
topics:
- Thermal Conductivity
- Temperature Effects
- Pressure Effects
- Metals
- Alloys
