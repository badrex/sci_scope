revised_title: 'On Mr. Spottiswoode''s Contact Problems: Analyzing Conic Sections
  and Surface Intersections'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the contact problems of conic sections with surfaces,
  focusing on the intersection points and the conditions required for various levels
  of contact. The study provides a mathematical analysis of the relationships between
  the coordinates of points and the coefficients of surfaces in contact problems.
