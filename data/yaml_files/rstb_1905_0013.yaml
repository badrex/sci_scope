revised_title: A Comprehensive Study of Indian Cobra Venom's Action and Effects
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Toxicology & Pharmacology
tldr: The authors investigate the pharmacological actions of Indian Cobra venom, focusing
  on its effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. They find that the
  venom primarily targets the cerebrospinal nerve centers and cardiac ganglia, leading
  to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. The study also highlights the importance
  of dose standardization and the role of artificial respiration in treating cobra
  venom poisoning.
