revised_title: Thermo-electric Properties of Platinoid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the thermo-electric properties of platinoid, an alloy
  similar to German silver, and determine its position in thermo-electric pairs with
  platinum, iron, aluminum, and two specimens of copper. They also discuss the experimental
  setup and methods used in their research.
