revised_title: Experiments on the Weight Variation of Ignited Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: Dr. John Roebuck conducts experiments to determine the weight variation of ignited
  iron and copper. He finds that iron loses weight when cooled, while copper gains
  weight. The results challenge the prevailing opinions of the time and suggest further
  inquiry into the properties of materials when heated and cooled.
