revised_title: 'On the Calculation of Attractions and the Figure of the Earth: A Theoretical
  Study'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the attraction and figure of
  the Earth, considering a heterogeneous spheroidal mass of fluid in rotation. The
  study involves calculating the attraction on a body composed of spheroidal layers
  and determining the equation of equilibrium for such a mass. The findings contribute
  to a better understanding of the Earth's shape and gravitational forces.
topics:
- Geodesy
- Gravity
