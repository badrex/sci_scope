revised_title: Innovative Induction-Currents Balance for Investigating Metals and
  Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author develops a highly sensitive induction-currents balance to study the
  molecular construction of metals and alloys. The instrument uses a telephone and
  microphone to detect and measure disturbances caused by different metals, providing
  valuable insights into their properties and potential applications.
