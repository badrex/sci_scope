  Types'

tldr: The authors describe two gigantic types of arenaceous foraminifera, Parkeria
  and Loftusia, found in the Upper Greensand near Cambridge and the Isle of Wight.
  These organisms have a unique structure and are difficult to classify within the
  foraminiferal type, but they are believed to be related to the group due to their
  central nucleus. Further research may reveal more varieties of arenaceous foraminifera
  that connect these anomalous species with known types.
