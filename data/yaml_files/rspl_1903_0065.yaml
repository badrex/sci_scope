revised_title: Investigating the Vapour Pressures of Liquid Oxygen on the Scale of
  the Constant-Volume Oxygen Thermometer
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors determine the vapour pressures of liquid oxygen on the scales of
  the constant-volume oxygen and nitrogen thermometers, finding that the deviation
  from the thermodynamic scale varies with initial pressure. Their results support
  Callendar's calculations of the deviation from the thermodynamic scale for thermometers
  filled at an initial pressure of 1000 mm of mercury at the melting point of ice.
