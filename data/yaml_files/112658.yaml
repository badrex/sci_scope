revised_title: Simplification of Merrifield's Method for Calculating Statical Stability
  of a Ship
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: The author proposes a modification to Mr. Merrifield's method for calculating
  a ship's statical stability by assuming the metacentric involute to be the involute
  of the involute of a circle. This simplification allows for a more accurate calculation
  of the ship's moment of stability at any given angle of inclination.
