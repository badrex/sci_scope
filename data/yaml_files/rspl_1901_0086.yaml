revised_title: Development of the Cauline Fibro-Vascular Skeleton in Pteridophyta
  and Gymnosperms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: 'This research focuses on the development of the stem in Pteridophyta and Gymnosperms,
  specifically the cauline fibro-vascular skeleton. The study concludes that the polystelic
  type does not originate through repeated bifurcation of the epicotyledonary central
  cylinder, but rather through a concentric fibro-vascular tube. The central cylinder''s
  tubular nature may be disguised by the overlapping of gaps and the appearance of
  medullary strands. The research suggests that there are two main types of fibro-vascular
  systems: phyllosiphonic, with foliar gaps, and cladosiphonic, without foliar gaps.'
