scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This paper presents experiments on the thermal conductivity of water and solutions,
  specifically focusing on the conductivity of water ranging from 0.0022 to 0.00245
  square centimeters per second. The study also determined the specific heat of sulfate
  of zinc solutions at different densities.
topics:
- Thermal Conductivity
