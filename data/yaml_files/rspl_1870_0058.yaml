revised_title: Experiments on Successive Polarization of Light and a New Polarizing
  Apparatus
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Sir Charles Wheatstone presents a new method for producing right-handed and
  left-handed successive polarization using a polarizing apparatus. The experiments
  involve the use of black glass, a Nicol's prism, and a crystallized plate, demonstrating
  the phenomena of successive polarization in both positive and negative crystals.
