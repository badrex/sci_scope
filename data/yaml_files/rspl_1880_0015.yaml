revised_title: Microscopic Examination of Fossil Wood from the Mackenzie River and
  Electrostatic Capacity of Glass
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: 'The author examines fossilized wood samples from the Miocene beds of the Mackenzie
  River, identifying three distinct species: Sequoia Canadensis, Ginkgo spec., and
  Platanus aceroides. Additionally, the author discusses the electrostatic capacity
  of glass and presents findings on the differences between previous experiments on
  specific inductive capacity.'
