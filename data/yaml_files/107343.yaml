revised_title: Influence of Soil Richness on Root Growth and Direction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates how soil richness influences the direction and growth
  of plant roots, finding that roots tend to grow towards rich soil and away from
  poor soil. The study suggests that roots are guided by factors other than just gravitation,
  and that they may have some degree of feeling and perception similar to animal life.
