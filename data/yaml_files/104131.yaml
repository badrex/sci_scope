revised_title: Further Investigations on the Nature of Electricity and its Interactions
  with Non-electric Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to study the behavior of electricity
  in various conditions, such as the interaction between electrical and non-electrical
  bodies, the effect of moisture on electrical properties, and the role of air in
  electrical phenomena. The findings provide insights into the nature of electricity
  and its behavior in different environments.
