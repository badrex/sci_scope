revised_title: Investigating Vacuum and Temperature Corrections for Pendulum Observations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of vacuum and temperature corrections on
  pendulum observations, with a focus on determining accurate methods for reducing
  observations made at varying pressures. They present preliminary results and discuss
  the importance of these corrections for future pendulum experiments.
