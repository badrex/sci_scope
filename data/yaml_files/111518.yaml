revised_title: On the Formation and Properties of Sodium-Ethyl and Potassium-Ethyl
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Organometallic Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of new ethyl-compounds
  containing alkali metals, specifically sodium-ethyl and potassium-ethyl. Sodium-ethyl
  was prepared by replacing a portion of zinc in zinc-ethyl with sodium, while potassium-ethyl
  was formed through a similar reaction with potassium. The author also discusses
  the reactions and properties of these new compounds, including their solubility,
  reduction by heat, and reactions with other substances.
