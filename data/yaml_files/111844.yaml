revised_title: 'On the Action of Sulphuric Acid on Nitriles and Amides: Discovery
  of Methylo-Tetra-Sulphuric Acid'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The authors, G. B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann, investigate the reaction of sulphuric
  acid on nitriles and amides, specifically acetonitrile. They discover a new substance,
  methylo-tetra-sulphuric acid, which they propose as a potential new chemical compound.
  The research also includes the synthesis and properties of this new substance, as
  well as its potential applications in organic chemistry.
