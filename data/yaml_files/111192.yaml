  Ocean
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Oceanography
tldr: The author, John Murray, examines the effects of tides and coastal erosion on
  the North Sea and German Ocean, discussing the similarities in the outlines of western
  shores, the movement of the Atlantic flood-tide, and the resulting changes in the
  landscape and depth of the sea. He also suggests that the tide's impact on the Baltic
  Sea and its surrounding areas may have contributed to the formation of Denmark and
  the Dogger Bank.
