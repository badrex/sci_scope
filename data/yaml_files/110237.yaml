revised_title: Electro-Magnetic Properties of Metalliferous Veins in Cornwall Mines
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Mineralogy
tldr: The author, Robert Were Fox, investigates the electro-magnetic properties of
  metalliferous veins in Cornwall mines and discovers that the intensity of electric
  currents varies with the abundance of copper ore and depth of the veins. He also
  observes that the electricity in mines is not influenced by the presence of workmen,
  candles, or explosions. Fox's experiments lead him to propose a connection between
  heat, electricity, magnetism, and the arrangement of veins in the earth's crust.
