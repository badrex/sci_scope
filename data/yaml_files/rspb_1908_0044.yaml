revised_title: A Comprehensive Study of the Cell Lamination in the Cerebral Cortex
  of the Lemur
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study examines the cell lamination of the cerebral cortex in four different
  species of lemurs, mapping out the various areas and their extents. The research
  provides insights into the brain development and structure of lemurs, comparing
  them to other mammals and primates.
