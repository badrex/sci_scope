revised_title: Bisulphite Compounds of Alizarin-Blue and Coerulin as Sensitizers for
  Low Refrangible Rays
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the use of bisulphite compounds of alizarin-blue and
  coerulin as sensitizers for low refrangible rays. He describes the process of preparing
  these compounds in a pure state and their effectiveness in enhancing the sensitivity
  of photographic plates, particularly in the violet and ultra-violet regions.
