revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Manganese and Its Compounds in High Temperature
  Flames
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the flame spectra of metallic manganese, manganese alloys,
  and manganese compounds at high temperatures. The author compares the spectra of
  metallic manganese and manganese oxide, as well as various manganese-containing
  alloys and compounds. The research also examines the spectroscopic phenomena and
  thermo-chemistry of the Bessemer process.
