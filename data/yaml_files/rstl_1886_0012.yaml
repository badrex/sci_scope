revised_title: On the Sympathetic Vibrations of Jets and Their Musical Sounds
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the sympathetic vibrations of jets and their musical
  sounds, discovering that the pitch of the tone produced depends on the velocity
  of the stream and the diameter of the orifice. The phenomenon is further explored
  through various experiments and observations, revealing the sensitivity of jets
  to external vibrations and the influence of pressure and distance on the resulting
  sounds.
