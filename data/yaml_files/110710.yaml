tldr: The author, Martin Barry, investigates the germinal spot in various animal ova,
  including mammals, birds, batrachian reptiles, and osseous fishes. He observes that
  the germinal spot transforms into cells, which are present in all ova. Barry confirms
  and explains the observations of R. Wagner, noting that the number of spots increases
  as the ovum ripens.
