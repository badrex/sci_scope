revised_title: The Discovery of Multiple Aniline Varieties and Their Impact on Aniline-Red
  Production

scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates various sources of aniline and discovers that commercial
  aniline contains a different base from normal aniline, which is essential for the
  production of aniline-red. He discusses the possibility of this base being an isomeric
  variety of aniline or a base analogous or homologous with aniline, and its potential
  impact on understanding the formation of rosaniline.
