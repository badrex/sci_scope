revised_title: Investigating Harmonic Ratios in the Spectra of Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author examines the spectra of various elements, including magnesium, sodium,
  copper, and barium, to investigate the presence of harmonic ratios in their spectral
  lines. The results show that the observed coincidences with harmonic ratios are
  fewer than expected, suggesting that the law of harmonic ratios may not be a true
  one.
