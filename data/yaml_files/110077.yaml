revised_title: Experiments on the Velocity of Sound in Holland
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The authors, G. Moll and A. Van Beek, conducted experiments to measure the velocity
  of sound in Holland using clocks with conical pendulums and advanced equipment.
  They found that at a temperature of 32Â°F, the velocity of sound is 1,089-7,445 English
  feet per sexagesimal second.
