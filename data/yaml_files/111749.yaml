tldr: The author, Arthur Hill Hassall, investigates the frequent occurrence of indigo
  in human urine and its chemical, physiological, and pathological relations. He finds
  that indigo is closely related to substances like haematine and urine pigment and
  suggests that it may be a vehicle for eliminating excess carbon in the body. This
  is supported by the observation that cases of extensive tubercular disease of the
  lungs, where decarbonizing functions are impaired, often show large amounts of indigo
  in the urine.
