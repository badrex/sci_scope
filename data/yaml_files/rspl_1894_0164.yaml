revised_title: The Composition of Extinctive Atmospheres Produced by Flames
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Analysis & Combustion
tldr: The author investigates the composition of the atmospheres produced by flames
  and finds that the composition of the extinctive atmosphere produced by common flames,
  such as candles and lamps, closely corresponds with the average composition of air
  expired from the lungs. These atmospheres are respirable with safety, and the extinction
  of such flames does not necessarily indicate an unsuitable atmosphere for breathing.
