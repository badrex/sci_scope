tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovers a new method to obtain triethylarsine and triethylstibine
  by using zincethyl on terchlorides of arsenic and antimony. He also identifies a
  series of compounds formed by reacting these substances with platinum and gold salts,
  and discusses their composition and properties.
