revised_title: Investigating the Impregnation of the Ovum in Amphibia
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author examines the process of impregnation in amphibians, focusing on the
  role of spermatozoa and the conditions of the ovum before and after impregnation.
  The study aims to provide evidence that spermatozoa are the sole agents in impregnating
  the ovum and that impregnation cannot be achieved by the seminal fluid alone.
