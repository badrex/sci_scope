scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Polymer Science
tldr: The author investigates the composition and changes in mastic resin through
  various chemical analyses and heating processes. The study reveals that mastic resin
  undergoes changes in its constitution when exposed to heat, and suggests that different
  resins may have varying compositions despite sharing similar properties.
