revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Electric Strain on Optical Retardation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: Dr. John Kerr investigates the effects of electric strain on optical retardation,
  discovering that the proper optical effect of electric strain is a positive or negative
  retardation of the component light whose plane of polarization is perpendicular
  to the line of force, depending on the dielectric's class.
