revised_title: Improving the Accuracy of Magnetometer and Meteorological Instrument
  Registration through Photography
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the temperature coefficients of two bar-magnets and
  develops a method to improve the accuracy of magnetometer and meteorological instrument
  registration using photography. The method involves comparing simultaneous registers
  from different locations and accounting for temperature variations in the magnets'
  force changes.
