revised_title: Electrical Methods for Investigating the Mammalian Nervous System
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the mammalian nervous system using electrical methods
  to study the excitatory processes in nerve fibers and localize functions within
  the spinal cord. They find that electrical changes in the spinal cord can be observed
  when the cortex is excited, and that these changes can be used to determine the
  extent of interruption in nerve channels and the localization of cortical areas
  of representation.
