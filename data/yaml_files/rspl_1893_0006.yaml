scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the mimetic forms of certain butterflies in the genus
  Hypolimnas, exploring the changes in species as they move between localities. They
  find that these butterflies exhibit a superficial resemblance to other species in
  their localities, providing evidence for the theory of mimicry proposed by H. W.
  Bates.
