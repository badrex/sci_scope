scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Faraday's experiments detail the process of condensing various gases into liquids,
  including sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, chlorine dioxide, nitrous
  oxide, cyanogen, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and chlorine. The author describes
  the methods used to obtain these liquid bodies and their properties, such as pressure
  and boiling points.
