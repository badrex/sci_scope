revised_title: A Study of Catalytic Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Fats in the Liquid
  State with Nickel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Catalysis
tldr: The authors investigate the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated fats in the
  liquid state using nickel as a catalyst. They compare the behavior of various oils
  and find that the reaction follows a general pattern, with an initial linear segment
  followed by a change in direction to a gentler slope. The results suggest that the
  hydrogenation process is similar to enzymatic hydrolysis, providing insight into
  the mechanisms of catalytic reactions at solid surfaces.
