revised_title: The Relationship between Minimal Lethal Dose and Body Surface in Warm-Blooded
  Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Toxicology & Pharmacology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the minimal lethal dose of
  various toxic substances and an animal's body weight. They find that the minimal
  lethal dose can be expressed as a function of the body surface, and that the concentration
  in the plasma is proportional to the body surface, regardless of the animal's weight.
  This has implications for drug dosage in different species.
