revised_title: Determination of the Boiling Point of Liquid Hydrogen Using Hydrogen
  and Helium Gas Thermometers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: James Dewar determines the boiling point of liquid hydrogen using hydrogen and
  helium gas thermometers. The experiments reveal that the boiling point of hydrogen
  is -253.0Â°C, and the constant volume gas thermometer is used to measure low temperatures
  with minimal error.
