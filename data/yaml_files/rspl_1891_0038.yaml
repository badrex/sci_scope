tldr: The author examines the morphology and development of spore-producing members
  in Lycopodinæ and Ophioglossaceæ, providing insights into the evolution of these
  plants and their relationship to other vascular cryptogams. The study focuses on
  the structure and function of sporangia in these plants, offering a comparative
  analysis of different species and their developmental processes.
