revised_title: The Analogy between Liquid-Gas and Solution Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Solutions
tldr: The author discusses the similarities between liquid-gas and solution phenomena,
  proposing that they are essentially the same nature. He also explores the concept
  of supersaturated solutions and the continuous transition from solvent to solvent,
  suggesting that there may be a continuous curve representing these changes.
topics:
- Chemical Solutions
- Osmotic Pressure
- Supersaturated Solutions
- Critical Solution Point
- Phase Transitions
