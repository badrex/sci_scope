  Connections'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author examines the minute anatomy of the frog's tongue papillae, focusing
  on the intricate network of nerve fibers and their connections to the surrounding
  tissues. The study reveals new insights into the relationship between nerve fibers
  and the nervous system, challenging previous assumptions about tissue continuity
  and the role of nerves in influencing other tissues.
