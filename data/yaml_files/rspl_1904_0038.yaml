revised_title: Investigating Electric Resistance Thermometry at the Boiling Point
  of Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: This study investigates the use of electric resistance thermometers to measure
  temperature at the boiling point of hydrogen. The author examines the resistance
  of various metals and alloys and discusses the limitations of using electric resistance
  thermometers at very low temperatures.
topics:
- Thermometry
- Electric Resistance
- Low Temperature Physics
- Temperature Measurement
- Metal Resistance
