  Diagnostic Applications
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of serum from highly immunized animals on
  various microbes, discovering that it can cause bacterial clumping, loss of motility,
  and inhibition of growth. This reaction can be used for diagnostic purposes, such
  as distinguishing between different types of bacteria.
