revised_title: Temperature Dependence of the Photo-elastic Effect in Strained Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the stress-optical coefficients
  of glass and finds that these properties are not permanently fixed but can vary
  with time and the life-history of the glass. The results suggest that a rise in
  temperature causes a temporary increase in the coefficient, and further study of
  the effects of previous treatment on the glass is needed.
