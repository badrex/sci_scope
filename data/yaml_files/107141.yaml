revised_title: An Investigation into the Effect of Surface Coatings on Heat Transfer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the effect of various surface coatings on the rate of
  heat transfer in a heated instrument. They find that coatings such as glue, varnish,
  and paint can significantly accelerate the cooling process, with black coatings
  being the most effective. The study suggests that the coatings may affect heat transfer
  through a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation.
