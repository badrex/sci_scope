revised_title: The Decomposition of Nitrous Acid and Nitrous Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of nitrous acid and nitrous air using
  red-hot iron tubes and discovers that nitrous air can be converted into phlogisticated
  air. The process also produces volatile alkali, suggesting a possible inversion
  of the process to produce nitrous acid or nitrous air from volatile alkali.
