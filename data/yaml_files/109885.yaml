scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author, William Elford Leach, discusses the genus Ocythoe and describes
  a new species found in the Paper Nautilus. He also addresses the debate on whether
  Ocythoe is a parasitical inhabitant of the Argonaut's shell or a part of the shell
  itself, citing observations from John Cranch. Leach provides distinguishing characteristics
  between Ocythoe and Polypus, and describes the new species as Ocythoi Cranchii.
