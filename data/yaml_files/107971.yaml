revised_title: Investigating Pendulum Corrections and Anomalies in Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Measurement
tldr: The author examines the discrepancies and anomalies observed in pendulum experiments,
  focusing on the correction for reduction to a vacuum. The study investigates various
  pendulums and proposes a new method for determining the true correction, emphasizing
  the importance of accurate pendulum comparisons for solving the problem of the length
  of the seconds pendulum.
