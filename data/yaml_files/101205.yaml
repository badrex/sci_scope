revised_title: Richard Towneley's Letter on the Invention of Dividing a Foot for Mathematical
  Purposes
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Measurement
tldr: Richard Towneley shares a letter from the late Mr. Gascoigne, who invented a
  device capable of dividing a foot into thousands of parts for precise angle measurements.
  The instrument was used for astronomical observations, including the distance of
  the moon and the motion of planets. Towneley also mentions his improvements to the
  device and its potential applications.
