tldr: The author, John Lubbock, investigates the two methods of reproduction in Daphnia
  and the structure of the Ephippium. He describes the male organs, the development
  of agamic and ephippial eggs, and the ephippium's role in protecting the eggs until
  hatching. Lubbock also discusses the relationship between eggs and buds, and the
  concept of individuality in species.
