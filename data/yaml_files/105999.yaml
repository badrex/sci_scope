revised_title: Adapting De Luc's Barometer Height Measurement Rule to Fahrenheit's
  Thermometer
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, explains M. De Luc's rule for measuring
  heights using a barometer and adapts it to Fahrenheit's thermometer. The rule accounts
  for changes in air density due to temperature and provides a more accurate method
  for determining heights. Maskelyne also converts the formula to English measure,
  making it more accessible for use in England.
