revised_title: Investigations on the Inhibition of Cholate Gel Formation by Organic
  Compounds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biophysics
tldr: The author investigates the influence of organic compounds on the formation
  of a cholate gel, which has properties similar to cell membranes. They find that
  substances with a high ability to lower water's surface tension generally have a
  greater inhibitory effect on gel formation, but narcotics and acetonitrile are notable
  exceptions. The results show a close correlation between the inhibitory action on
  gel formation and other biological reactions, such as narcotic effects.
