scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Techniques & Instrumentation
tldr: Sir William Crookes explores the benefits of using iridium crucibles in chemical
  operations, highlighting their resistance to various chemicals and high temperatures.
  Iridium crucibles are compared to platinum crucibles, showing that iridium is more
  resistant to corrosion and maintains its shape better. Crookes also mentions experimenting
  with rhodium crucibles, which have a lower density and cost, making them a potential
  alternative to iridium.
