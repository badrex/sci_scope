revised_title: Investigating the Polarization of X-Rays and Their Relation to High-Velocity
  Cathode Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors investigate the polarization of X-rays and their relationship to
  high-velocity cathode rays. They find that the polarization of primary X-rays can
  be analyzed using a specific apparatus, and discuss the implications of these findings
  for understanding the nature of X-rays and their interactions with matter.
