revised_title: Innovations in Torsion Balance and Research on Elementary Laws of Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author develops a new torsion balance, the bifile balance, which relies
  on gravity instead of elasticity, and uses it to conduct experiments on the elementary
  laws of electricity. The balance is well-suited for measuring small forces of repulsion
  and researching electricity and magnetism.
