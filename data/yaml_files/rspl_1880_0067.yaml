tldr: The author investigates the presence of a bacterium, Bacterium decalvans, in
  cases of alopecia areata and finds that it is associated with the destruction of
  hair. The bacterium is observed in diseased hairs and its presence is linked to
  the disease's progression. A treatment designed to destroy bacteria effectively
  arrests the disease in seven consecutive cases.
