revised_title: The Configurations of Rotating Compressible Masses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The author investigates the configurations of rotating compressible masses,
  focusing on the impact of compressibility and non-homogeneity on the shapes of astronomical
  objects. The study explores the series of pseudo-spheroids and pseudo-ellipsoids,
  which can be terminated abruptly by the vanishing of certain forces.
