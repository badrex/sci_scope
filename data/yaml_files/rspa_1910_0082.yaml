scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the radium content and rate of helium production in
  various types of basalts and compares his findings with those of other researchers.
  The results show that his measurements are even lower than previous findings, emphasizing
  the discrepancy between his results and those of other experimenters like Prof.
  Joly.
