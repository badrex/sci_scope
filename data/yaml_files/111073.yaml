revised_title: Carbon Deposits in Gas Retorts as Negative Plates in Nitric Acid Voltaic
  Batteries
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy Storage
tldr: Christopher Leefe Dresser investigates the use of carbon deposits from gas retorts
  as negative plates in nitric acid voltaic batteries, finding them to be a cost-effective
  and durable alternative to platinum plates. The carbon plates maintain their conducting
  power for extended periods without deterioration or alteration.
