revised_title: A Theorem on the Resolubility of Indeterminate Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a theorem that determines the resolubility of indeterminate
  equations in integral numbers based on the properties of determinants and quadratic
  forms. The theorem includes the resolubility theorems of Legendre and Gauss and
  is applicable to both real and complex integers.
