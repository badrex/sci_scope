revised_title: Multiple Radiations and Discontinuous Discharges from the Negative
  Terminal
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the multiple images and radiations from the negative
  terminal of vacuum tubes, discovering that these images are formed by a series of
  discrete discharges of diminishing strength. This finding supports the theory that
  electrical discharges in vacuum tubes are discontinuous or 'disruptive.'
