scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study investigates the anatomy, physiology, and degenerations of the nervous
  system in birds, focusing on the tracts and cell groups within the brain. The research
  includes observations on the fowl and pigeon, using transverse, sagittal, and horizontal
  sections stained with Weigert's method or the acid haematoxylin stain of Schafer.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the bird's nervous system and its
  functional significance.
