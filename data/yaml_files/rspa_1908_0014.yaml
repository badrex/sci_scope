revised_title: Observations of Concentric Envelopes and Arches in Prominences
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author analyzes photographs of solar prominences taken with a spectroheliograph
  and observes a series of concentric envelopes and arches. These formations indicate
  that either this form is a rare feature of prominence material or that the envelopes
  seldom appear broadside-on on the limb, allowing the arch system to be fully displayed.
