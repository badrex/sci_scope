tldr: The authors discover that Kaloxylon, previously thought to be an independent
  plant, is actually the root of Lyginodendron Oldhamium. They provide a complete
  account of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron, including the stem, foliage,
  and adventitious roots, after finding specimens in actual continuity with the stem
  of Lyginodendron.
