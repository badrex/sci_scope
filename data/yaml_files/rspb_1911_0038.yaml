revised_title: Causes of Oxygen Absorption in the Lungs During Rest and Exercise
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the causes of oxygen absorption in the human lungs during
  rest and exercise. They find that under normal conditions, oxygen absorption is
  by diffusion alone. However, during muscular work or when breathing low-oxygen air,
  the lung epithelium is excited to secrete oxygen actively, indicating a new aspect
  of the physiology of mountain climbing, balloon ascents, and ordinary muscular work.
