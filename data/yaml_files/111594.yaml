revised_title: Atomic Weight of Graphite and Its Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author, Benjamin C. Brodie, investigates the atomic weight of graphite and
  discovers a distinct system of compounds. He determines that graphite has an atomic
  weight of 33 and that it forms unique compounds different from other carbon compounds.
  Additionally, the specific heat of graphite supports this conclusion, making it
  an exception to the general law of elemental bodies.
