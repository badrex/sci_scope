revised_title: Stratifications in Electrical Discharges and Secondary Circuit Interruptions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: J. P. Gassiot investigates the stratifications in electrical discharges and
  demonstrates that they can be destroyed by interrupting the secondary circuit. This
  experiment builds upon previous research and contributes to the understanding of
  electrical phenomena.
