revised_title: Comparing Diurnal Ranges of Magnetic Declination at Toronto and Kew
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The authors compare the diurnal ranges of magnetic declination at Toronto and
  Kew, finding that the phases of magnetic inequalities occur at Toronto nearly two
  days before the corresponding phases at Kew. This supports the idea of a progression
  of magnetic weather from west to east.
