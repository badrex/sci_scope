revised_title: Determination of the Relative Atomic Weights of Nitrogen and Sulphur
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the relative atomic weights of nitrogen and sulphur
  by analyzing nitrogen sulphide. They develop a method to decompose the substance
  using quartz wool heated to bright redness, and determine the atomic weights through
  a series of experiments.
