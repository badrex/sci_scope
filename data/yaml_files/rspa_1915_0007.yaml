revised_title: Investigating the Production of Rare Gases in Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the production of rare gases, such as helium and neon,
  in an electric discharge. They explore various experimental conditions and methods
  of analysis to determine if rare gases can be produced and if external factors,
  such as air leakage, affect the results. The study concludes that rare gases were
  not obtained when the tube and electrodes were evacuated and no detectable air leakage
  was present.
