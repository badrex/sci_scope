revised_title: Investigation of Optical Properties of Glass and the Specific Resistance
  of Sulphur
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the optical properties of glass, specifically the changes
  in reflected and transmitted light after polishing. They also study the specific
  resistance and other properties of sulfur. The results show that the polishing process
  affects the surface layer of glass, leading to changes in its optical properties.
topics:
- Optical Properties
- Sulphur
- Refraction
- Surface Layer
- Transmission Coefficients
