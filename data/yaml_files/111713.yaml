tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the transformation of bromide of bromethylated triethylphosphonium
  through various reactions, including its conversion to bromide of vinyl-triethylphosphonium
  and the formation of oxide of a phosphonium with ethyl substitutions. He also examines
  the reaction between triethylphosphine and monochlorinated chloride and monobrominated
  bromide of ethyl, resulting in the formation of hexethyl salts.
