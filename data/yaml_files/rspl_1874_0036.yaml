tldr: The authors compare the physiological effects of crotaline, viperine, and colubrine
  snake poisons, focusing on the nature and action of crotalus poison. They observe
  differences in the phenomena that precede and accompany death, as well as the tendency
  for local and general haemorrhage and extravasation of blood. The authors also investigate
  the coagulation or non-coagulation of blood in cases of snake poisoning.
