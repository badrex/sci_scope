revised_title: Investigating the Origin of the Stellar Line near λ 4686
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors study a mysterious line near λ 4686 in celestial spectra and find
  that it is likely part of the hydrogen spectral series. They suggest further research
  on helium spectra under varying electrical conditions to potentially discover the
  terrestrial equivalents of the new hydrogen series.
