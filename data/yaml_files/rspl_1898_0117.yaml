revised_title: Investigations on the Reflection and Electrification of Cathode Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the reflection and electrification of cathode rays,
  using the Faraday cylinder method and magnetic deflection experiments. The results
  show that paracathodic rays, or reflected cathode rays, have similar properties
  to cathode rays, including negative charge and magnetic deflection. The author also
  explores the weak mechanical force exerted by reflected cathode rays and the mode
  of reflection using a spherically concave reflector.
