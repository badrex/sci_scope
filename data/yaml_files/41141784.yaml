revised_title: 'Magnetic Properties of Iron Plate by Rotation: Repetition of Mr. Christie''s
  Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, S. H. Christie and Henry Foster, report on the repetition of experiments
  conducted by Christie on the magnetic properties imparted to an iron plate by rotation.
  They found that the plate caused deviations in a horizontal needle depending on
  the direction and position of the plate, suggesting an intermediate latitude where
  no deviations would be produced by rotation.
