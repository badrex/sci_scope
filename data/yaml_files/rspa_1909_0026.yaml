revised_title: Stability Analysis of Jacobi's Ellipsoid and its Comparison with Maclaurin's
  Spheroid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The author investigates the stability of Jacobi's ellipsoid and compares it
  with Maclaurin's spheroid, providing a detailed analysis of the zonal and tesseral
  harmonics involved in the process. The study aims to verify the complicated analysis
  used in previous investigations and to determine the form of Jacobi's ellipsoid.
