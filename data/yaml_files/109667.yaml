revised_title: 'Analysis of Compound Inflammable Gases through Slow Combustion: Experiments
  on Coal Gas'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Dr. William Henry presents an apparatus for analyzing compound inflammable gases
  by slow combustion, focusing on gas from coal. The method involves burning the gas
  with oxygen and measuring the resulting carbonic acid, oxygen, and other byproducts.
  The author provides examples of calculations for various gases, including hydrogen,
  olefiant gas, and gas from cannel coal, and discusses the specific gravities of
  these gases.
