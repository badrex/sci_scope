revised_title: The Innervation of Dental Pulp and Dentine
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the nerve supply to the dentine of human teeth and finds
  that nerves from the pulp enter the dentine's tubules, contrary to previous assumptions.
  The nerves form a dense plexus beneath the odontoblast layer and extend into the
  dentinal tubes, providing a rich nerve supply to the tooth.
