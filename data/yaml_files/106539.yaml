revised_title: The Long-Term Effects of Stem Washing on Tree Growth
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Forestry & Arboriculture
tldr: The author presents further evidence of the benefits of washing tree stems,
  demonstrating that cleaned trees experience greater growth and increased nourishment
  compared to their unwashed counterparts. The author suggests that this may be due
  to the absorption of finer dew particles by dirt and moss, which can hinder a tree's
  access to air and sunlight.
