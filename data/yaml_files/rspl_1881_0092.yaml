  Force
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of vagus nerve stimulation on the rhythm
  and contraction force of the frog heart. They discover that stimulation can cause
  varying effects, from complete quiescence to increased contractions, and that these
  effects are dependent on the condition of the heart's nutrition.
