scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory
tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the theory of matrices, their properties,
  and applications. He introduces the concept of matrices, their addition, multiplication,
  and the formation of powers and functions. Cayley also discusses the theorem that
  any matrix satisfies an algebraic equation of its own order and its applications,
  including finding the general expression of matrices convertible with a given matrix.
