revised_title: On the Movements of the Flame in the Explosion of Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the movements of the flame and the pressures produced
  in the explosion of gases, focusing on the detonation-wave and its relationship
  with the combustion process. They discuss previous research and present their findings
  on the specific heats of gases at high temperatures and pressures.
topics:
- Explosions
- Detonatio
- Gaseous Explosions
- Combustion
- Pressure and Temperature in Explosions
