  of Potentials of Ellipsoids and Ellipses
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a method for dealing with definite integrals in spherical
  harmonic analysis and expands the potentials of ellipsoids and ellipses in series.
  The method is applied to various cases, including ellipsoidal shells, solid ellipsoids,
  elliptic plates, and electric currents in elliptic circuits.
topics:
- Spherical Harmonics
- Legendre Polynomials
- Laplace's Equation
- Ellipsoids
- Ellipses
