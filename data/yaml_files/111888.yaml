revised_title: Investigating the Distribution of Aqueous Vapour in the Upper Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author examines the distribution of aqueous vapor in the upper atmosphere
  and concludes that the hypothesis of an independent vapor atmosphere is incompatible
  with observed facts and known laws of temperature decrease. The study supports the
  idea that the tension observed at the surface is not dependent on or balanced by
  the pressure of vapor in the higher parts of the atmosphere.
