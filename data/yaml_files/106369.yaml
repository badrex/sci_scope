scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author extends Cardan's rule for resolving cubic equations to the irreducible
  case, providing a method for finding roots of equations where previous methods were
  insufficient. The article presents a detailed analysis of the second case of the
  cubic equation xÂ³ - qx = r, with a focus on the series and expressions used to calculate
  the roots.
