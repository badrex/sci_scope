tldr: The author investigates the functions of the intestinal canal and liver in the
  human foetus, discovering that the liver plays a crucial role in providing nutrition
  to the fetus. The study also reveals that the small intestines are more vascular
  than the stomach and great intestines, suggesting that absorption of nutrients occurs
  during the later months of gestation.
