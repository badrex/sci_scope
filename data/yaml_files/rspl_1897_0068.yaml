revised_title: On the Distribution of Frequency, Variation, and Correlation of Barometric
  Height at Diverse Stations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This article investigates the distribution of barometric height frequency, variation,
  and correlation at various stations in the British Isles. The authors find that
  the frequency distribution is continuous and fairly uniform along lines called generalised
  isobars. They also discuss the constants that best describe a local barometric frequency
  and explore the concept of correlation between stations.
