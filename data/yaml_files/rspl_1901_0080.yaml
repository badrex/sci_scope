revised_title: Investigating the Resistance and Electromotive Forces of the Electric
  Arc
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the resistance and electromotive forces of the electric
  arc using high-frequency alternating currents. They develop a new method to measure
  the impedance and power factor of the arc, concluding that at high frequencies,
  the arc behaves more like a non-inductive resistance and has a true resistance of
  approximately 10 ohms.
