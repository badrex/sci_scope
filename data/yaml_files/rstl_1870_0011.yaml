revised_title: An Investigation of the Relationship Between Terrestrial Galvanic Currents
  and Magnetic Disturbances on Days of Tranquil Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between terrestrial galvanic currents and
  magnetic disturbances on days of tranquil magnetism, comparing the additional thirty-six
  disturbed days with the days of moderate and tranquil magnetism. The study aims
  to understand the causal connection between galvanic currents and magnetic disturbances
  and explore the potential effects of galvanic currents on days of tranquil magnetism.
