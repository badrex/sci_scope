revised_title: Steam Production and Temperature Effects
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Heat Transfer & Thermodynamics
tldr: Jacob Perkins investigates the effects of temperature on steam production and
  evaporation. He finds that water evaporates more quickly when in close contact with
  heated metal, and that the time required for evaporation increases as the metal
  cools. Perkins also discusses the relationship between terrestrial magnetism, geological
  structure, and thermo-electrical currents.
