scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the role of nitrogen in the respiration
  process. Through a series of tests, it is concluded that nitrogen takes no appreciable
  part in the phenomenon of respiration, suggesting that it is not involved in the
  process of gas exchange in the human body.
