tldr: 'Marshall Hall discusses the function of the medulla oblongata and spinal cord,
  and introduces the concept of the excito-motory system of nerves. He presents experiments
  demonstrating the physiological and pathological actions of this system, and proposes
  a new division of the nervous system into three categories: cerebral, spinal, and
  ganglionic.'
