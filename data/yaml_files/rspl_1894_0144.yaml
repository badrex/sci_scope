revised_title: 'The Latent Heat of Evaporation of Water: Experimental Method and Results'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author presents an experimental method to measure the latent heat of evaporation
  of water using a complex calorimeter apparatus. The results show that the latent
  heat of evaporation decreases with increasing temperature, with a final value of
  581.68 J/g for water at 24.96Â°C.
