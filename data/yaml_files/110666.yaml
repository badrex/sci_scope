scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure of normal and adventitious bone using a microscope,
  discovering small, irregularly-shaped corpuscles arranged in circular layers around
  Haversian canals. These corpuscles are connected by filaments and are found in both
  cartilaginous and osseous structures, as well as in various types of adventitious
  bone.
