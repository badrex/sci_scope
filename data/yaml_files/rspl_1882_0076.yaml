revised_title: Photographic Action in the Spectrum of Denser Solutions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effect of denser solutions on the photographic action
  in the spectrum, finding that the red and infra-red spectrum remains visible while
  the blue is entirely quenched. This study allows for the photography of the infra-red
  spectrum without atmospheric absorption, expanding the range of possible research
  in this area.
