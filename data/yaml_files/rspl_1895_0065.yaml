scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates the morphology and evolution of spore-producing members
  in the Ophioglossaceae family, focusing on the process of septation and its role
  in the development of the Ophioglossum spike. The study compares the Ophioglossaceae
  with Lycopods and provides evidence for a common ancestry between the two groups.
