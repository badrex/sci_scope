  The Alloys of Lead and Tin'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This study investigates the constitution and properties of eutectic alloys,
  focusing on the lead-tin series. The composition of the eutectic alloy is found
  to be approximately 37% lead and 63% tin, with a transformation occurring in the
  alloys rich in lead at temperatures below complete solidification. The research
  includes thermal analysis, microscopic examination, and the determination of equilibrium
  points in the alloy system.
