revised_title: Stability Analysis of Pear-Shaped Equilibrium Figures in Rotating Liquid
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Oceanography
tldr: The author investigates the stability of pear-shaped equilibrium figures in
  rotating liquid using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis. The study reveals that the
  critical Jacobian ellipsoid is proportional to 0.65:0.66:0.81, and the angular velocity
  and density of the liquid are connected by a specific equation. The pear-shaped
  figure is likely stable, but absolute proof requires further approximation and analysis.
