scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author analyzes magnetic diurnal variations at Kew Observatory, finding
  that the 24-hour term dominates the differences between ordinary and quiet days.
  The study also reveals that the difference vector is a regular phenomenon with a
  24-hour period, and the amplitude of the difference vector varies with sunspot activity.

- Magnetic Variations
- Magnetic Declination
