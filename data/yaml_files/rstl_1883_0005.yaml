revised_title: 'On the Normal Paraffins: Part IV - Chlorination and Oxidation of Heptane
  from Pinus Sabiniana'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the chlorination and oxidation of heptane from Pinus
  Sabiniana, finding that only primary and secondary chlorides are formed, and that
  hydrochloric acid cannot effectively separate isomeric paraffins. The heptylene
  produced is identified as butylmethyl-ethylene.
