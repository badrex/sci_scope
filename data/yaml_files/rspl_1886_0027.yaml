revised_title: Color Photometry and its Applications in Spectral Analysis
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors develop a method to compare the intensity of lights of different
  colors and investigate the luminosity of the spectrum. They also study color perception
  in color-blind individuals and discuss the intensity of incandescence of carbon
  electrically heated.
