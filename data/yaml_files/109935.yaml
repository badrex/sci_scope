revised_title: Determining the Obliquity of the Ecliptic and the Maximum of the Aberration
  of Light
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author presents observations made at Trinity College Observatory in Dublin
  to determine the obliquity of the ecliptic and the maximum of the aberration of
  light. The study compares the obliquity from early observations with the present
  one, discussing the impact of refraction on the results and the importance of paying
  attention to winter solstice observations.
