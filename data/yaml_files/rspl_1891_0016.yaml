revised_title: On the Electromagnetic Stress and Energy Flux in the Field
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the forces, stresses, and energy flux in electromagnetic
  fields, proposing a new method for expressing electromagnetic theory using vector
  algebra. He also examines the stress in electromagnetic fields, including the effects
  of impressed forces and intrinsic magnetization, and discusses the principles of
  energy continuity and the distribution of energy in the field.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Energy Flux
- Stress in Electromagnetic Fields
- Vector Algebra
- Maxwell's Equations
