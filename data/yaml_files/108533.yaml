revised_title: Observations on Ovules and Their Maturation in Women

scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author presents two case studies of unimpregnated women who had died during
  menstruation, in which ovules were discovered in their Fallopian tubes. This supports
  the theory that ovules can be extruded from the ovary and enter the Fallopian tubes
  without impregnation, challenging the idea that fecundation must occur within the
  Graafian follicle.
