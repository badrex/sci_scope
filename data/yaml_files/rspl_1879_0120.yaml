revised_title: Further Investigations into Vacuum Discharges and Molecular Streams
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: This paper explores the nature and laws of the disruptive discharge or electric
  spark in high vacuums, using various methods and sources of electricity. The authors
  describe the effects of different tubes containing discharges in the sensitive state
  on a standard test tube, and study the phenomena of molecular streams and phosphorescence
  in high vacuums. They also discuss the mode of formation of the positive column
  and the relation of molecular streams to the discharge.
topics:
- Electrical Discharge
- Vacuum Physics
- Molecular Streams
- Phosphorescence
- High Vacuum Phenomena
