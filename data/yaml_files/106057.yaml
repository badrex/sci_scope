revised_title: William Henly's New Electrometer and Electrical Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The article describes a new electrometer invented by William Henly, which can
  measure the degree of electrification and the exact quantity of charge in a jar
  or battery. The device is made of ivory or wood and can be used to determine the
  moment of time when electricity changes in a jar. The author also presents several
  electrical experiments, including the imitation of earthquake effects using lateral
  force of explosions and the electrification of sealing wax using a piece of tin
  foil.
