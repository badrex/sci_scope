revised_title: On the Rigidity of the Earth and its Implications for Tides and Nutation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: The author, William Thomson, investigates the rigidity of the Earth and its
  effect on tides, precession, and nutation. He concludes that the Earth must be much
  more rigid than steel, and that its interior is likely much more rigid than its
  upper crust. This finding supports the idea that the Earth's solid crust is at least
  800 miles thick and possibly even thicker than 2000-2500 miles to maintain its figure
  against tidal forces.
