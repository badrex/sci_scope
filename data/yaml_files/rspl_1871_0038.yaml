revised_title: On the Induction of Electric Currents in a Plane Sheet of Uniform Conductivity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of electric current induction in a thin,
  infinite conducting sheet when exposed to a changing magnetic field. Using the principle
  of images, the author simplifies the problem and demonstrates that the induced currents'
  magnetic effect is equivalent to the effect of the actual currents in the sheet.
