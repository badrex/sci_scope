tldr: Faraday investigates the effects of specific inductive capacity using a novel
  apparatus, the Differential Inductometer. He demonstrates that the apparatus can
  detect differences in inductive capacity and polarity of dielectric materials, such
  as shell-lac and sulfur, and can be used to examine gases and crystals.
