revised_title: Experimental Determination of the Velocity of White and Coloured Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the velocity of white and colored
  light using a modified Fizeau method with two distant reflectors. They found that
  blue light travels faster than red light, with a difference of approximately 1.8%
  in velocity. The results support the idea that the more refrangible the source of
  light, the greater the velocity.
