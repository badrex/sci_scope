scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Hydraulics
tldr: The author investigates the rising and falling of water in ponds and rivers
  near the sea, proposing a Tantalus-like mechanism to explain the phenomena. The
  experiment involves using concealed syphons in a series of containers to simulate
  the effects of ebbing and flowing rivers and changing seasons.
