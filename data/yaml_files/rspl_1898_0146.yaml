tldr: The author investigates stomatal behavior in plants using a hygroscope, a device
  that measures stomatal opening based on the curvature of a horn index. The study
  reveals that stomata in terrestrial plants partially close during the night, while
  aquatic plants show little to no closure. The hygroscope also demonstrates the effect
  of various factors, such as light, temperature, and mechanical stress, on stomatal
  opening and closing.
