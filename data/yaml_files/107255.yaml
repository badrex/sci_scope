revised_title: Dissection of a Human Foetus Without a Heart and Circulation of Blood
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author examines a human foetus without a heart and discovers that the circulation
  of blood is maintained through the action of the vessels alone, with the placenta
  serving as the source and termination of the circulation. This finding challenges
  prior beliefs that a heart is necessary for proper growth and development of a foetus.
