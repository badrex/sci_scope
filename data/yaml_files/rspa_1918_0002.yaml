revised_title: Turbulence and Temperature Variations in the Lower Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between turbulence, temperature variations,
  and heat transfer in the lower atmosphere. They find that turbulence decreases with
  height in winter and increases in summer, with potential implications for weather
  patterns and climate.
topics:
- Atmospheric Turbulence
- Temperature Gradient
- Heat Transfer
- Meteorology
- Atmospheric Convection
