  Opening

tldr: Joseph Toynbee's study investigates the function of the Eustachian tube and
  the role of muscles in opening it. He concludes that the Eustachian tubes are usually
  closed, and the act of swallowing opens them. The author argues that the function
  of hearing is best carried out with the tympanum as a closed cavity, contrary to
  the common belief that the air within the tympanum must communicate freely with
  the outer air.
