revised_title: Microscopic Observations of the Optic Nerve Structure and Function
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the structure of the optic nerve using a microscope and
  discovers numerous holes resembling filaments. He hypothesizes that the nerve fibers
  are made up of soft fluid globules, which are exhaled during drying. The author
  also proposes a mechanism for how the animal spirits representing visual images
  pass through the optic nerve to the brain.
