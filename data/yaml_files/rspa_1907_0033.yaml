revised_title: Investigation of Total Ionisation of Various Gases by Uranium Alpha-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the total ionisation of various gases using uranium
  alpha-rays and find that the ionisation values vary depending on the gas type. They
  also determine the range of the alpha-particles from uranium and the voltage required
  for saturation current.

- Ionisation
- Uranium Alph
- Gas Ionisation
