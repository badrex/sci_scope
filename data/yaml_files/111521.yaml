revised_title: On the Formation and Properties of Peroxides of Organic Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the formation of peroxides of organic radicals, specifically
  peroxides of benzoyl and acetyl, and their properties. These peroxides are prepared
  by reacting anhydrous acids or their corresponding chlorides with barium peroxide.
  The author describes the preparation process, properties, and analysis of these
  peroxides, and discusses potential future research directions.
