revised_title: On the Relation between Liquid Transpiration and Chemical Composition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between liquid transpiration and chemical
  composition, focusing on the transpiration of various substances through capillary
  tubes. The study reveals that the rate of transpiration depends on the chemical
  composition of the substance, providing a new physical property that can help determine
  its chemical constitution.
