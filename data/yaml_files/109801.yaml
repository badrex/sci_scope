revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Oblique Timbers and Construction Alterations
  in Ships
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: Thomas Young examines the effects of oblique timbers and other construction
  alterations in ships, analyzing the forces acting on them and their resistance to
  strain. He concludes that while oblique timbers can provide additional stiffness,
  their ultimate strength is not significantly affected and further experimentation
  is needed before fully adopting these changes.
