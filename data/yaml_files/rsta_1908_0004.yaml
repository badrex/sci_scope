revised_title: Negative Electricity Discharge from Hot Calcium and Lime
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the discharge of negative electricity from hot calcium
  and lime, comparing the results with that of platinum. They find that the negative
  leak from calcium is higher than that of lime and platinum, suggesting differences
  in their electropositive characters.
