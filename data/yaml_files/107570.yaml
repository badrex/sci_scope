scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: John T. Todd conducts experiments on the Torpedo electricus, investigating the
  voluntary power over its electrical organs and the effects of various incisions
  on the production of shocks. He observes that the shocks continue even after significant
  alterations to the electrical organs, suggesting a complex nervous system at play.
