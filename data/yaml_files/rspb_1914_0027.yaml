revised_title: The Role of Chlorophyll in Photosynthesis and Intermittent Vision
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Photosynthesis
tldr: The author investigates the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and its connection
  to intermittent vision. They suggest that the production of sugars and starch in
  green leaves may be initiated by the photo-oxidation of chlorophyll and the subsequent
  polymerization of the aldehyde formed, rather than direct photo-synthesis of carbon
  dioxide and water.
