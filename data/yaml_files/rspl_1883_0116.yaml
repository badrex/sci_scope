revised_title: An Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon through Mechanical Strain and Thermoelectric
  Effects
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author explains Hall's phenomenon by combining mechanical strain caused
  by electromagnetic action and certain thermoelectric effects. The phenomenon is
  not directly related to the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarized light, as
  previously thought.
topics:
- Hall effect
- Electromagnetic strain
- Thermoelectric effects
- Mechanical strain
