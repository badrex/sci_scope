revised_title: Unusual Sightings of Icebergs in Unusually Low Latitudes in the Southern
  Hemisphere
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Climate Change
tldr: The author reports on the sighting of icebergs in unusually low latitudes in
  the southern hemisphere, specifically in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope and
  the coast of South Africa. The author suggests that these sightings may be due to
  an unknown cause, such as an earthquake or volcanic forces, disrupting the icebergs
  from their place of formation. The author also notes the anomaly of northern and
  southern icebergs appearing in the lowest latitudes in April or May, which may be
  due to being carried from the polar regions by similar currents in the same months.
