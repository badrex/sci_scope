revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Expansion of Superheated Steam
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This paper investigates the law of expansion of superheated steam and compares
  it to the expansion of air and other permanent gases. The authors present a detailed
  experimental setup and methodology, and their findings confirm the general law of
  expansion for superheated steam, which is almost identical to that of air and other
  permanent gases.
