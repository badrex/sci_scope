revised_title: Investigations on Phyllocyanin and its Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author studies the properties of phyllocyanin, a product of the action of
  acids on chlorophyll, and its compounds with zinc and other metals. He demonstrates
  that zinc carbonate compounds can be formed with phyllocyanin, while no similar
  compounds with iron or copper are produced. The author also investigates the changes
  in proteids in seeds during germination and the presence of a proteolytic ferment.
