tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by Abbe Nolet and J.T. Desaguliers
  on the effect of various salts on the cold of ice. They found that certain salts,
  such as sea salt and sal ammoniac, can increase the cold of ice, and suggested using
  these findings for making ice creams and testing gunpowder purity.
