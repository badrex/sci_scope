revised_title: Physiological Action of Chinoline and Pyridine Bases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: The authors investigate the physiological effects of various chinoline and pyridine
  bases, comparing their actions on different organisms and analyzing the differences
  between bases obtained from cinchonine and those derived from tar. They find that
  there is a gradation in the extent of physiological action in the pyridine series,
  and that higher members of the series resemble lower members of the chinoline series
  in their effects. The study also reveals that artificial bases with a similar chemical
  structure to natural bases are generally weaker physiologically, but have the same
  kind of action.
