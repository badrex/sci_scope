revised_title: Comparing the Effects of Sympathetic Nerve Section and Spinal Cord
  Injury on the Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: This paper explores the similarities between the effects of sectioning the cervical
  sympathetic nerve and a lateral half of the spinal cord. Both result in increased
  blood flow, elevated temperature, and heightened sensitivity. The author also discusses
  the potential reasons behind these similarities, such as the influence of oxygen
  on the spinal cord and the state of rest of the muscles and motor nerves.
