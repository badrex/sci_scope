revised_title: Investigations of the Photochemical Law of the Silver Halide Grain
  in Photographic Plates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the photochemical behavior of individual silver halide
  grains in photographic plates, focusing on the factors that determine the blackening
  of the plate after exposure to light. They conclude that the grain or crystal of
  silver halide is the photochemical unit in the dry plate, and that the photochemical
  law of the silver halide grain is a crucial factor in understanding the photographic
  process.
