scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author examines the effects of clothing and environmental factors on human
  body temperature and blood circulation. They find that changes in arterial tension,
  caused by varying levels of clothing and exposure to cold air, can significantly
  impact the body's temperature and heat diffusion.
