revised_title: 'Intestinal Absorption: A Study on Serum, Peptone, and Glucose Absorption'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the absorption of serum, peptone, and glucose in the
  intestine using a method that involves two loops of intestine. The results demonstrate
  the physiological activity of the intestinal epithelium in the absorption process
  and reveal the factors affecting the absorption of different nutrients. The study
  also highlights the role of cell activity and blood supply in the absorption process.
