revised_title: Investigating the Heat and Cold of Animals and Vegetables
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Thermobiology
tldr: The author, John Hunter, conducts experiments on the heat and cold of animals
  and vegetables, using thermometers of improved construction. He observes that perfect
  animals have a greater ability to retain a standard heat and resist variations,
  and that external applications and disease can cause variations in their heat. He
  also investigates the effects of heat and cold on different parts of the body and
  their ability to adapt to temperature changes.
