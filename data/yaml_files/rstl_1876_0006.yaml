revised_title: On Rolling-Friction and the Deformation at the Point of Contact
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Tribology
tldr: The author investigates the resistance experienced by a roller rolling on a
  flat surface and concludes that the deformation at the point of contact causes slipping,
  leading to friction. The author also discusses the effect of material properties
  on the resistance to rolling and the importance of understanding this phenomenon
  in various applications, such as railway-wheels.
