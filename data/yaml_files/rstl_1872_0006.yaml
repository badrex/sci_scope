  Biddell Airy'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The Astronomer Royal, George Biddell Airy, presents corrections to the computed
  wave-lengths of light published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1868. He compares
  and corrects the wave-lengths using a graphical process and a series of numbers
  computed on a continuous formula. The corrections are applied to the wave-lengths
  for spectral lines of the atmosphere and various metals, providing more accurate
  measurements.
