tldr: The author investigates the effects of dividing the supra-cesophageal commissures
  in crayfish and observes the resulting changes in the animal's movement and coordination.
  The study suggests that the sub-oesophageal ganglia play a role in coordinating
  locomotion, feeding movements, and rhythmic swings, while the supra-oesophageal
  ganglion is responsible for the animal's volitional activity, equilibrium, and swimming.
