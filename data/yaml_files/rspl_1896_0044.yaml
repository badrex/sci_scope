revised_title: 'Sporangia Development on Fern Prothalli: A Preliminary Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates sporangia development on fern prothalli and discovers
  that they can be borne on the prothalli, with some sporangia forming in groups resembling
  sori. The study also reveals that the presence of tracheides, which are similar
  to those found in apogamous prothalli, may indicate a connection between sporangia
  development and apogamy in the prothallus.
