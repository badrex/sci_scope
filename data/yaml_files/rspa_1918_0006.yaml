scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Applied Mathematics
tldr: The author investigates the zeros of Bessel functions using contour integrals
  and the method of steepest descents, providing a new approach to understanding the
  zeros of these functions, particularly for high-order functions.
topics:
- Bessel Functions
- Zeros of Functions
- Asymptotic Expansions
- Contour Integrals
- Method of Steepest Descents
