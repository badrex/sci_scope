revised_title: Investigation of Gold Leaf Structure and Absorption Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author examines the structure of gold leaf and its absorption spectrum.
  They discover that the black lines visible in gold leaf under a microscope are due
  to minute wires or threads of the metal, formed during the gold beating process.
  The study also presents the results of an examination of the absorption spectrum
  of metallic gold in various forms, such as gold-colored glass and reduced solutions
  of its salts.
