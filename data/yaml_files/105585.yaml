tldr: In a letter to Philip Carteret Webb, Sir Francis Haskins Eyles Stiles describes
  the sudden eruption of Mount Vesuvius on December 23, 1760. The eruption produced
  a vast column of black smoke, which covered the mountain and a significant portion
  of the sky. Two large columns of smoke were also observed at the foot of the mountain,
  indicating eruptions in that area. The line of fire from the eruption was estimated
  to be two to three miles long, and the lava flow was believed to be near the sea.
  Mr. Lowther and Mr. Watson, who were at the mountain during the eruption, narrowly
  escaped harm.
