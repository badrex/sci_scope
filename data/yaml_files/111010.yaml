scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: B. C. Brodie investigates the chemical nature of wax, specifically the portion
  soluble in boiling alcohol, known as myricine. He discovers palmitic acid and a
  new wax-alcohol, melissine, and a solid hydrocarbon, melene. The study concludes
  that waxes are chemically related to fatty bodies and can undergo similar transformations.
