scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author, Richard Hey, presents a series of geometrical propositions related
  to tangents to circles and trapeziums inscribed in circles. He also explores the
  elliptic representations of circles on a plane surface using perspective. The paper
  focuses on the positions of the axes of the representing ellipses and their practical
  applications.
