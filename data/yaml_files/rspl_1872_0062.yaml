revised_title: Determination of the Electrostatic Units in the Electromagnetic Unit
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors describe experiments conducted at Glasgow University to determine
  the relationship between the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of measurement.
  They also provide a summary of similar observations made by W.P. King in 1867 and
  1868. The results show that the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units
  is a velocity, which is crucial in the electromagnetic theory of light.
