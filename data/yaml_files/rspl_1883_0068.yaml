revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Electrical Stimulation on the Frog's Heart
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study examines the effects of electrical stimulation on the frog's heart,
  focusing on the refractory period, the sensitive phase, and the impact of heat,
  cold, and drugs on the heart's contractions and rhythm. The research expands upon
  previous work by Marey and Dr. Burdon Sanderson and Mr. Page, exploring the effects
  of stimulation on both the ventricle and auricle, and providing insights into the
  transmission of stimuli within the heart.
