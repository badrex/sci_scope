revised_title: 'Cyanogen Reaction of Proteids: A New Method for Distinguishing Proteid
  Classes'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author discovers that the cyanogen reaction in proteids can be used to distinguish
  between native albumins and peptones and albumoses. By modifying the traditional
  biuret reaction test with the addition of ammonia, the author can accurately differentiate
  between various proteid classes.
