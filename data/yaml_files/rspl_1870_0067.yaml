revised_title: On the Change of Pressure and Volume in Chemical Combination
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the changes in pressure and volume during chemical reactions,
  specifically focusing on the relationship between temperature, pressure, and the
  state of the products. The study concludes that the pressure always increases at
  constant volume during a chemical reaction, with the exception of rare cases where
  the products are entirely in the solid or liquid state.
