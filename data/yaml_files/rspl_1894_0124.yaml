tldr: This study investigates the roots of fossil plants, specifically Catamites and
  Calamodendron, found in coal measures. The authors examine the internal structure
  and organization of the roots, concluding that they possess characteristics common
  to all vascular plants. They also address the doubts expressed by other researchers
  regarding the identification of Astromyelon and Myriophylloides, confirming their
  classification as adventitious roots of Calamites.
