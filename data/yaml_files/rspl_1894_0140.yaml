revised_title: 'Embryonic Fission in Lichenopora: A Comparative Study with Crisia'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author investigates embryonic fission in Lichenopora verrucaria, a type
  of Bryozoan, and compares its development process with that of Crisia. The study
  reveals that while Crisia forms a coherent mass of cells, Lichenopora undergoes
  a process of fission, creating a secondary embryo.
