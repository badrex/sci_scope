scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: The author investigates the gametogenesis and sex determination in the gall-fly,
  Neuroterus lenticularis, and discovers that the eggs laid by some females undergo
  maturation and produce males, while others lay unfertilized eggs that develop into
  females. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of sex determination in
  insects.
