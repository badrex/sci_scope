revised_title: The Residual Charge of the Leyden Jar and its Relation to Dielectric
  Properties
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The authors investigate the residual charge of the Leyden jar and propose a
  connection between dielectric properties and the time required for the development
  or decay of the electropolar state. They also explore the effects of mechanical
  agitation on the residual charge and the analogy between coercive force in magnetism
  and electro-coercive force in dielectrics.
