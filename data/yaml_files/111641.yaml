revised_title: The Influence of Different Media on the Pitch of Sound
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates how the pitch of sound changes when conducted through
  various media, such as solids, liquids, and gases. The study reveals that porosity
  and conductivity play a significant role in altering the pitch, with porous materials
  lowering the pitch and dense materials raising it.
