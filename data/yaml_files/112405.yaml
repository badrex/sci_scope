scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of clouds through experiments
  involving the exhaustion and dilatation of air in experimental tubes. He observes
  differences in cloud properties, such as luminous energy, stability, and texture,
  and explains these differences based on the specific gravity of the vapour and liquid
  involved. The author also discusses the unique properties of aqueous vapour and
  its role in the soft and tender beauty of atmospheric clouds.
