tldr: The author conducts further analytical experiments on prussic, ferruretted chyazic,
  and sulphuretted chyazic acids, as well as their salts, and applies Dalton's atomic
  theory and Berzelius's addition to the theory to analyze the chemical compositions
  and combinations of these compounds.
