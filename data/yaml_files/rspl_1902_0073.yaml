revised_title: Extending the Study of Short-Period Pressure Variations Across Large
  Areas
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate
tldr: The authors investigate the similarity of short-period pressure variations over
  large areas, including India, Ceylon, Java, Mauritius, and Australia. They find
  that these variations are connected meteorologically and extend to regions in the
  northern and southern hemispheres. The study also reveals that pressure variations
  in the United States, such as in Florida and California, are inversely related to
  those in the antipodal regions.
