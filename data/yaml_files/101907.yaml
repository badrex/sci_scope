scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Circulatory System
tldr: The author estimates the quantity of blood in humans and calculates the speed
  of its circulation based on animal comparisons and heart function. The study suggests
  that a person weighing 160 pounds would have no more than 8 to 12 pounds of circulating
  blood, resulting in a circulation rate of 93 to 94 times per hour.
