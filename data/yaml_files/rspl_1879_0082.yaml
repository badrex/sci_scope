revised_title: Chemico-Electric Relations of Metals in Solutions of Salts of Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Processes
tldr: The author investigates the chemico-electric relations of various metals in
  solutions of potassium salts, examining the order of electromotive forces and the
  effects of solution strength and temperature on these relations. The results provide
  a basis for understanding the true electrical relations of metals in liquids and
  may be useful for future investigations.
