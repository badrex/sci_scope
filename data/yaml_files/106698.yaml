revised_title: Experiments on the Transmission of Acid Vapors through Hot Earthen
  Tubes and Further Observations on Phlogiston
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the transmission of acid vapors through hot
  earthen tubes and further investigates the concept of phlogiston. He finds that
  oil of vitriol and spirit of nitre, in their most dephlogisticated state, are saturated
  with phlogiston, and that when part of the acidifying principle is expelled, the
  remainder becomes supersaturated with phlogiston.
