revised_title: A Simplified Method for Meteorological Registration of the Chemical
  Action of Total Daylight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the chemical action of total
  daylight using a simple and compact apparatus. This method, based on the principles
  of photochemical measurements, allows for regular meteorological registration of
  the chemical action of sunlight and can be used to create daily observations at
  frequent intervals.
