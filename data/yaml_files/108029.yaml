scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal and solar inequalities of tides at Liverpool,
  finding that the equilibrium theory can explain these phenomena. However, the author
  emphasizes the need for a more accurate and comprehensive solution to the problem
  of tidal motion and equilibrium of fluids in hydrodynamics.
