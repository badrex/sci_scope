scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on the properties of light, focusing
  on the refraction, reflection, and inflexion of light rays. He discovers that the
  size of images formed by these processes varies depending on the color of the light,
  with red light forming larger images and violet light forming smaller images.
