revised_title: 'Tempering of Iron Hardened by Overstrain: A New Method of Softening
  Materials'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the tempering of iron hardened by overstrain and discovers
  a new method of softening materials by heating them above a specific temperature.
  This method is applicable to steel and wrought iron and possibly other materials
  that can be hardened by overstrain and softened by annealing.

- Iron Hardening
- Overstrain Tempering
- Annealing
- Yield Point
- Elasticity Recovery
