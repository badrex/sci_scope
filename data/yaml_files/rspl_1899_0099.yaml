revised_title: 'Crystallographical Study of Double Selenates: Zinc Salts and Alkali
  Metals'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the crystallographical properties of double selenates
  of zinc salts with different alkali metals. The study reveals that the morphological
  and physical constants of rubidium zinc selenate are intermediate between those
  of potassium and caesium zinc salts, with atomic weight playing a significant role
  in the properties of the crystals.
