tldr: This paper discusses the efforts to create accurate maps of terrestrial magnetism
  and the magnetic phenomena occurring during the 1830s. The author presents data
  from various sources, including sea-based observations by Mr. Dunlop and Lieut.
  Sulivan, to create a comprehensive map of magnetic lines of force and intensity.
  The paper also highlights the importance of precise observations and the challenges
  faced when conducting magnetic research at sea.
topics:
