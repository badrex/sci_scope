revised_title: The Influence of Alkaline Carbonates and Protective Agents on Uric
  Acid Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The author investigates the influence of alkaline carbonates and protective
  agents like glycocine on uric acid decomposition. He discovers that weak solutions
  of alkaline carbonates can decompose uric acid in solution, producing oxalic acid
  and urea. Glycocine is found to protect uric acid from decomposition in alkaline
  solutions, while hippuric acid loses its protective power. The study also reveals
  the absence of uric acid in the urine of herbivorous mammals when the urine is alkaline,
  but its presence when the urine is acidic.
