revised_title: Investigating Quadrifocal Stream-Lines and Their Applications in Naval
  Architecture
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: The author explores quadrifocal stream-lines, also known as cycno√Øds, and their
  potential applications in naval architecture. These stream-lines, which have four
  foci, can be used to design more efficient ship shapes with smoother water flow,
  leading to reduced resistance and improved performance.
