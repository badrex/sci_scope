scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author, Benjamin Bevan, conducts experiments to determine the modulus of
  torsion in various types of wood and metals. He uses sound and dry specimens, free
  from large knots, and applies an improved method of measuring dimensions. Bevan
  provides a rule for calculating the deflection of a prismatic shaft and a table
  of the modulus of torsion for different woods, which varies from about 9000 to 30,000
  pounds, following the order of specific gravity. In metals, the modulus of torsion
  is one-sixteenth of the modulus of elasticity.
