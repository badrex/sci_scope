tldr: Rev. Baden Powell investigates the dark bands in the solar spectrum caused by
  partial interception by transparent plates. He explains that the phenomenon can
  be explained by the undulatory theory, showing that a difference in retardation
  between the two halves of each primary pencil throughout the spectrum can cause
  bands within certain limits.
