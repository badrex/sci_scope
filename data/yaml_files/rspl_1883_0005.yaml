revised_title: Terrestrial Radiation and the Influence of Aqueous Vapour
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate Science
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the effect of terrestrial radiation on the earth's
  surface and the role of aqueous vapour in regulating heat transfer. He observes
  significant temperature differences between the earth's surface and the air above
  it, and demonstrates how atmospheric conditions, such as humidity and cloud cover,
  can impact the rate of heat loss from the earth.
