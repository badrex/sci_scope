revised_title: On the Law of Variation of Magnetic Forces Generated at Different Distances
  during Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the mutual action of magnetic particles and the law
  of variation of magnetic forces generated during rotation. Experiments with magnets
  and a rotating disc reveal that the magnetism destroyed by removing concentric portions
  from the disc is proportional to the mass removed, but has a greater ratio to the
  whole magnetism developed than the mass removed has to the whole.
