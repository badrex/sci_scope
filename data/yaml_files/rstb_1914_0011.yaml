  Muscles'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author investigates nerve anastomosis in limb muscles, focusing on anastomosis
  of the nerves supplying limb muscles. The study examines various experiments and
  their results, discussing factors that determine the date of recovery and the necessity
  for precaution to prevent the formation of communications with the central ends
  of nerves.
