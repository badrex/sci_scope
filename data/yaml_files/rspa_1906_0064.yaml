revised_title: The Affinity Constants of Methylated Amino-Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the affinity constants of amphoteric electrolytes, specifically
  methylated amino-acids, and discusses the effects of methylation on their ionization
  and hydration. The study reveals that the introduction of a methyl group into the
  basic radical of an amino-acid generally leads to a decrease in both acidic and
  basic constants due to stereochemical effects and ring-formation.
