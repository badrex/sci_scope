  Applications'

scientific_subdiscipline: Hydraulics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: James Thomson reports on experiments conducted on the friction of discs revolving
  in water, focusing on the efficiency of turbine water-wheels and centrifugal pumps.
  He presents a general equation to describe the relationship between the velocity
  of revolution, disc diameter, and mechanical work consumed in friction. Further
  experiments on centrifugal pumps are planned, with a remaining budget from the Royal
  Society's Experimental Fund.
