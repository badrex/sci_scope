revised_title: The Role of Albumoses and Organic Acid in Diphtheritic Paralysis
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Pathology
tldr: The author investigates the causation of paralysis following diphtheria and
  discovers that it is likely caused by the action of albumoses and an organic acid
  produced by the Bacillus diphtherias. These substances, when injected into healthy
  animals, cause fever, paralysis, and nerve degeneration, supporting the theory that
  diphtheria is a disease involving the digestion of body proteins and the subsequent
  toxic effects of the resulting albumoses and organic acid.
