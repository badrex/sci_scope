revised_title: Investigations on Electric Discharge and Chloride of Silver Battery
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The authors, De La Rue and Muller, investigate the electric discharge with the
  chloride of silver battery and find that the pressure of least resistance for a
  given gas varies with the diameter, shape, and dimensions of the vessel employed.
  They also discover that the dark space near the negative in electric discharges
  in vacuum tubes is not entirely dark and provide photographic evidence of this phenomenon.
  Lastly, they discuss the effects of passing an electric discharge through a tube
  with palladium terminals containing hydrogen gas.
