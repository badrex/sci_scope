revised_title: Effects of Air Passed through Red Hot Metals on Life and Flame
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Gas Laws
tldr: F. Hauksbee investigates the effects of air passed through red hot metals on
  the lives of animals and flame. He discovers that the air can cause convulsions
  and temporary death in animals, and extinguish flames in candles. The air's elasticity
  and specific gravity remain unchanged, suggesting that the effects are due to changes
  in the air's nature or the effluvia from the hot metals.
