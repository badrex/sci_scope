revised_title: A New Method for Obtaining Continuous Currents from Magnetic Detectors
  of the Self-Restoring Type
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author presents a method for obtaining continuous unidirectional currents
  from a magnetic detector of the self-restoring type, which can be used for rapid
  recording work and improve the efficiency of telephonic reception.
