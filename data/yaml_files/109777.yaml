revised_title: Analysis of the Alcohol of Sulphur or Sulphuret of Carbon
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors, J. Berzelius and A. Marcet, investigate the composition of the
  alcohol of sulphur or sulphuret of carbon. Through a series of experiments, they
  determine that the compound consists of 84% sulphur and 15-17% carbon, and does
  not contain any other elements. They also examine various carbo-sulphurets of alkalies
  and earths, and analyze a solid white crystalline compound formed by exposing the
  sulphuret of carbon to nitro-muriatic acid fumes.
