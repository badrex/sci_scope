  Absorbing Powers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effect of radiation on various surfaces with modified
  radiating and absorbing powers, discovering that the movement of these surfaces
  under radiation is influenced by their physical condition and the coatings applied
  to them.
