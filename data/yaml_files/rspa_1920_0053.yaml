revised_title: Improving Estimations through Linear Compounding and Conjugate Sets
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Methods
tldr: The authors develop a method for improving estimations by using linear compounding
  and conjugate sets, which can be applied to various types of data. This method is
  particularly useful for cases where the errors are independent and form a standard
  system.
