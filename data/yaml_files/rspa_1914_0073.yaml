tldr: This study investigates the potential difference between two aqueous solutions
  of potassium ferrocyanide separated by a colloidal copper ferrocyanide membrane.
  The authors discuss the ionization of the solutions and the potential deviations
  in their findings, attributing them to uncertainties in the calculation of ion concentrations
  and deviations from ideal solution laws.
