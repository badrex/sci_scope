revised_title: The Evolution of a Star's Spectrum during its Growth from a Nebula
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrochemistry & Stellar Evolution
tldr: The author investigates the evolution of a star's spectrum during its growth
  from a nebula, considering factors such as density, temperature, and the mingling
  of stellar gases. The study suggests that hydrogen and helium are common to all
  stars and nebulae, and that the spectrum changes as a star cools and elements with
  higher atomic weight concentrate towards the center.
