revised_title: 'Dynamics of a Rigid Body: Extensions and Applications of the Theory
  of Screws'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author explores the dynamics of a rigid body using the theory of screws,
  focusing on the virtual coefficient of a pair of screws, coreciprocal screws, and
  the sexiant. The study demonstrates the applicability of the screw theory to various
  problems in the dynamics of a rigid body and provides further extensions and applications
  of the theory.
