revised_title: A New Analysis of Lunar Motion and the Sun's Impact on the Moon's Orbit
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Lunar Motion
tldr: Richard Dunthorne compares the Newtonian Theory with lunar observations and
  examines the impact of the Sun's position on the Moon's orbit. He finds that the
  current equations do not accurately account for the Sun's influence, suggesting
  improvements to the lunar motion calculations.
