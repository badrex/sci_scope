scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Metabolism
tldr: The authors investigate the function of the thyroid gland and its impact on
  metabolism, nerve centers, and hemopoiesis. They find that the gland plays a crucial
  role in regulating metabolism and blood corpuscles production, and its removal leads
  to symptoms similar to old age, myxedema, and altered nerve center function.
