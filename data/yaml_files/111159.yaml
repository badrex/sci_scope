revised_title: On a General Law of Density in Saturated Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author, J.J. Waterston, investigates the relationship between pressure,
  temperature, and density in saturated vapors. He develops a mathematical theory
  and presents a general law that explains the behavior of various gases and vapors,
  including steam, ether, alcohol, and carbon sulfide. The findings reveal that the
  density of saturated vapors follows a parabolic curve, with the G temperature as
  a key factor.
