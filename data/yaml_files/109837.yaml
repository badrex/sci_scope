tldr: William Herschel observes and records the satellites of the Georgian Planet,
  making accurate measurements and calculations of their orbits. He infers that the
  nodes of the first two satellites have nearly the same longitude and inclination,
  and estimates the distances to which they must move from the planet before becoming
  visible through his 20-feet telescope.
