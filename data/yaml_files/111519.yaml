revised_title: Investigation of Sodium-Ethyl and Potassium-Ethyl Formation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Edward Frankland investigates the formation of sodium-ethyl and potassium-ethyl
  and finds that they cannot be obtained by the action of sodium on iodide of ethyl.
  The decomposition of iodide of ethyl by sodium-ethyl produces hydride of ethyl and
  olefiant gas, suggesting a new approach to forming hydrogen compounds of highly
  positive metals.
