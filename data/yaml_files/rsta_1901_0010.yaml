revised_title: Investigation of Flame Spectra in Open-heart and Basic Bessemer Processes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of flames resulting from the open-heart
  and Basic Bessemer processes, identifying various elements such as rubidium, cesium,
  calcium, copper, silver, and gallium. They also study the chemical composition of
  steel and the effects of phosphorus during the process, but fail to determine a
  specific indication for stopping the blast.
