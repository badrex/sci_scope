scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author investigates periodical laws in magnetic disturbances and finds a
  correlation between the frequency and magnitude of disturbances and solar spots.
  The study examines the effects of these disturbances on the magnetic declination
  and suggests a possible connection between the disturbances and the sun as the primary
  source.
