revised_title: On the Precession of a Viscous Spheroid and the Earth's Remote History
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the precession of a viscous spheroid and its implications
  on the Earth's remote history. The study considers the effects of tidal friction,
  the rotation of the moon, and the Earth's cooling and contraction on the planet's
  obliquity and overall evolution.
