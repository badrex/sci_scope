scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author, Martin Barry, discusses the penetration of spermatozoa into the
  ovum and highlights that this fact was already established in 1843, as published
  in the Philosophical Transactions. He refers to his own paper from 1843, where he
  observed spermatozoa within mammiferous ova, and mentions a drawing in the Edinburgh
  New Philosophical Journal for October 1843, which shows spermatozoa in the interior
  of an ovum.
