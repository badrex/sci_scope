scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Military & Defense Engineering
tldr: Captain J. Norton presents a design for a percussion shell that can explode
  at the bottom of the sea. The shell consists of an iron tube, a suspended rod with
  a percussion-cap, and waterproof components. The shell's wings maintain its vertical
  position during descent, and the impact on the seabed triggers the explosion.
