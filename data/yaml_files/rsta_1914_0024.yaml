scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of cathode rays and radium on diamonds,
  finding that while cathode rays do not confer radioactivity, exposure to radium
  can cause a persistent change in the diamond's properties, including radioactivity
  and coloration.
