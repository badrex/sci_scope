revised_title: The Gradual Approach of the Earth to the Sun and the Acceleration of
  its Motion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Motion
tldr: Leonard Euler discusses the gradual approach of the Earth to the Sun and the
  acceleration of its motion. He examines historical observations and suggests that
  the Earth's orbit is becoming smaller, leading to a shorter period for its revolution.
  Euler also argues that this implies the solar system cannot last forever and must
  have had a beginning and an end.
