tldr: The author, John Bishop, investigates the fundamental cause of human voice tones
  and deduces that the vibrations of the glottis are responsible. He also explores
  the factors affecting the vibrating length and tension of the vocal ligaments, the
  role of the vocal tube, and the production of falsetto tones.
