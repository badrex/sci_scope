tldr: The authors observed the occultation of Cor Leonis by the Moon using a reflecting
  telescope made by Mr. Short. They found that the star immersed into the dark limb
  of the Moon and emerged from the enlightened limb, confirming their observation
  with different telescopes. The observation was made in Surrey-Street in the Strand,
  London, and the results were communicated to the Royal Society by J. Bevis.
