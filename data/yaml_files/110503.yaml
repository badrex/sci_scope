tldr: Samuel Solly's paper investigates the connection between the anterior columns
  of the spinal cord and the cerebellum, providing evidence for the existence of a
  continuous fibrous connection between these two parts of the nervous system. Solly
  also discusses the roles of the antero-lateral columns, facial nerve, and pneumogastric
  nerve in voluntary and involuntary movements.
