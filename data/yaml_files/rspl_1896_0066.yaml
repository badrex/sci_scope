revised_title: 'Selective Conductivity in Polarizing Substances: Nemalite and Chrysotile'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the selective conductivity of polarizing substances,
  specifically nemalite and chrysotile, and discovers that they exhibit double conductivity
  and absorption, with the direction of absorption being the direction of maximum
  conductivity.
topics:
- Polarizing Substances
- Selective Conductivity
- Nemalite
- Chrysotile
- Electric Ray Polarization
