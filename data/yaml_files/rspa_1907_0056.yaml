revised_title: On the Velocity of Cathode Particles Emitted by Various Metals under
  the Influence of Röntgen Rays and its Implications for Atomic Disintegration
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of cathode particles emitted by various
  metals under the influence of Röntgen rays. They find that the velocity of the ejected
  electrons is primarily due to the energy of the explosion within the atom, suggesting
  that atomic disintegration is taking place.
