revised_title: On the Occlusion and Absorption of Hydrogen Gas by Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the occlusion and absorption of hydrogen gas by various
  metals, particularly focusing on palladium and its ability to absorb large amounts
  of hydrogen without releasing it into a vacuum at low temperatures. The study also
  explores the relationship between hydrogen absorption and the oxidation of metals.
