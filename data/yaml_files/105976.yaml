revised_title: Improving Distillation Techniques to Reduce Fumes and Enhance Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Techniques
tldr: The author presents a new method of distillation that condenses fumes and reduces
  noxious vapors, allowing for more efficient and safer operations. The technique
  is demonstrated through experiments involving sal ammoniac, quicklime, and acid
  of salt, resulting in increased yield and reduced loss of volatile alkali.
