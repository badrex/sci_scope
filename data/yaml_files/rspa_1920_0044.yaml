revised_title: 'A Re-examination of Light Scattered by Gases: Polarization Experiments
  on Common Gases'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author re-examines the polarization of light scattered by common gases,
  improving experimental methods and confirming earlier findings. The study uses a
  broader beam of light and a specially designed background to minimize stray light,
  and employs a curved horn made of green glass to enhance the effectiveness of the
  setup.
