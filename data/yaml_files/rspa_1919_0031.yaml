revised_title: A New Method for the Absolute Determination of Frequency
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibrations
tldr: The authors describe a new method for determining the absolute frequency of
  acoustical vibrations using a sub-synchronous pendulum and an intermittent electro-magnet.
  The method is rapid, convenient, simple, and inexpensive, making it suitable for
  use with various time standards. The frequency of the pendulum is maintained as
  an exact sub-multiple of the frequency of the fork-interrupter, allowing for accurate
  frequency determination.
