revised_title: Investigating the Two-Fold Spectra of Oxygen and Nitrogen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the two-fold spectra of oxygen and nitrogen, exploring
  the possibility that they are produced by different gases or different vibrations
  of the oxygen molecule. They conduct experiments using sparking and electrolysis
  techniques to analyze the properties of the gases and their spectra.

- Spectroscopy
- Oxygen Spectra
- Nitrogen Spectra
