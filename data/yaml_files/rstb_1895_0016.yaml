  The Roots of Calamites'

scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the roots of Calamites, a type of fossil plant found
  in coal measures, and provides evidence that these roots were appendages of the
  stem. The authors analyze the structure and organization of the roots, including
  their lacunar cortex, absence of nodes, solid pith, and lack of canals accompanying
  vascular bundles, to establish their morphological nature.
