revised_title: On the Theoretical and Analytical Aspects of Spheroids and Attraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Physics & Astronomy
tldr: The author critiques Laplace's method for computing the attractions of spheroids,
  specifically focusing on the theorem that Laplace claims is true for all spheroids
  nearly approaching a spherical figure. The author argues that the method is not
  applicable to all spheroids and that Laplace's demonstration is incomplete and erroneous.
