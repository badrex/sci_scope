revised_title: Improvements in Astronomical Observations with a Vertical Floating
  Collimator
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Instrumentation
tldr: Henry Kater describes a vertical floating collimator, an improved instrument
  for astronomical observations, which can be used with both circles and zenith telescopes.
  The vertical floating collimator offers advantages over previous methods, such as
  reduced errors and faster observations, potentially leading to more precise celestial
  measurements.
