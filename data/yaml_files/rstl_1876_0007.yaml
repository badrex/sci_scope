scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the development of spinal nerves in elasmobranch fishes,
  specifically focusing on the first appearance and early stages of these nerves.
  The study uses embryos of Scyllium ca, Scyllium, and Torpedo, and reveals that the
  spinal nerves form first in the neck region before appearing in other areas. The
  findings contribute to the understanding of the development of the nervous system
  in these types of fish.
