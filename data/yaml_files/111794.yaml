tldr: This paper presents a continuation of a previous work on a class of differential
  equations and their applications in dynamical problems. The author focuses on the
  variation of elements in elliptic motion, the motion of a free simple pendulum,
  and transformations of differential equations using new variables. The results are
  applied to planetary theory, providing a comprehensive understanding of the motion
  of a planetary system.
