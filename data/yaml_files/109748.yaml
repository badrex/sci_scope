scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: Thomas Knight presents a solution to the problem of piercing a hemisphere with
  an indefinite number of equal and similar cylinders, ensuring that the remaining
  surface can be exactly quadratured and the remaining volume can be exactly cubatured.
