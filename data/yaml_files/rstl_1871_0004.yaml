revised_title: Further Investigations on Supersaturated Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the role of nuclei in separating gas, vapor, or salt
  from supersaturated solutions and defines the terms 'clean' and 'unclean' in relation
  to nuclei. He also explores the importance of surface cleanliness and the impact
  of foreign matter on nuclear action.
topics:
- Supersaturated Solutions
- Nuclei in Supersaturated Solutions
- Chemical Cleanliness
- Surface Tension
- Catharization
