revised_title: On the Changes of Thermoelectric Power and Their Relation to Magnetic
  Strains
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the changes in thermoelectric power caused by magnetization
  and their relation to magnetic strains in iron, nickel, and cobalt. The study reveals
  that the thermoelectric and elongation curves for iron and nickel are influenced
  by the physical condition of the metal and that the direction of the thermoelectric
  force is the same for nickel and iron, while the metals' responses to magnetization
  differ.
