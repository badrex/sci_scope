revised_title: 'Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This study investigates the electro-chemical effects observed between a magnetized
  and an unmagnetized iron and steel bar when in a circuit with various electrolyte
  solutions. The magneto-chemical effect is found to vary with the nature of the metal
  and solution used, as well as the extent of magnetic saturation of the metals.
