  and Its Comparison to the Traditional Method
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machines
tldr: The author examines Monsieur Perault's new axis in Peritrochio, which claims
  to be entirely frictionless, and compares it to the traditional method. The analysis
  shows that the new axis is less efficient and has more friction than the traditional
  method, rendering it less effective for raising weights.
