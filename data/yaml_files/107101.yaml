revised_title: Improvements to the Reflecting Circle for Enhanced Accuracy
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Techniques
tldr: The author discusses improvements to the reflecting circle, a type of optical
  instrument used in astronomy, to increase its accuracy in measuring angular distances
  between celestial objects. The improvements include the use of a Flying Nonius,
  which allows for more precise measurements and reduces errors caused by the instrument's
  size and limitations.
