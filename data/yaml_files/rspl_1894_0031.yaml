  Coefficients of Refraction in Northern and Southern Sections'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: This study examines the coefficient of refraction in the Western Himalayan Mountains,
  comparing the values obtained in the Northern and Southern sections. The results
  show that the coefficient of refraction is greater in the Southern section, and
  it increases with altitude, while in the Northern section, it decreases. The differences
  in behavior are attributed to varying atmospheric conditions, possibly due to the
  amount of moisture in the air.
