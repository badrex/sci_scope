scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the effect of staleness on the development of Echinoids'
  sexual cells. The research shows that the rate of deterioration of the sexual cells
  increases suddenly after a certain period, with the average time of maximum deterioration
  being around 24 hours after the shedding of the cells. The study also highlights
  the importance of the freshness of the sexual cells in the development of Echinoids.
