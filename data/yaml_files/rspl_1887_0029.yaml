revised_title: On the Limiting Distance of Speech by Telephone and the Factors Affecting
  It
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Telecommunications & Electronics
tldr: This article investigates the factors that determine the limiting distance of
  speech by telephone, such as inductive capacity, resistance, and wire length. The
  author explains that the number of vibrations per second that can be transmitted
  through a circuit is limited by these factors, and that the telephone's sensitivity
  to small changes in current makes it an excellent instrument for research.
