scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mining & Mineral Processing
tldr: The author describes a process for extracting pitch, tar, and oil from a blackish
  stone found in Shropshire coal mines. The bituminous substance is separated from
  the stone by grinding it into powder and boiling it in water. The resulting materials
  can be used as alternatives to traditional pitch and tar for ship maintenance and
  as an oil substitute for pain relief.
