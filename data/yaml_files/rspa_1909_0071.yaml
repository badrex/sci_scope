revised_title: Experiments on the Polarization of Secondary X-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Subatomic Physics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to test whether secondary X-rays are polarized,
  using a carbon radiator and an electroscope. The results show that the ratio of
  intensities in different directions varies, indicating that secondary X-rays are
  indeed polarized.
