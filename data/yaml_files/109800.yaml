revised_title: A Revolutionary Approach to Ship Construction
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: Robert Seppings introduces a new ship construction method that uses diagonal
  timbers and planks to increase the hull's strength and resist bending from head
  to stern. This innovative approach also improves the ship's watertightness and allows
  for easier replacement of decayed parts.
