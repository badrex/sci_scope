scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Malacology & Marine Biology
tldr: The author describes a rare species of worm shells discovered on an island off
  the northwest coast of Sumatra after a violent earthquake in 1797. The shells were
  found protruding from the mud in a sheltered bay and were up to five feet four inches
  in length. The shells' unique features include a radiated appearance, a division
  in the upper part, and the protrusion of tentacles from the apex. The author initially
  considered these shells as a new genus but later found similar shells described
  by Rumphius.
