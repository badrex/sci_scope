revised_title: On the Scattering and Absorption of Homogeneous β-Rays and the Number
  of Electrons in the Atom
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the scattering and absorption of homogeneous β-rays
  and use the results to determine the number of electrons in an atom. They find that
  the mean deflection experienced by a β-particle passing through a material is dependent
  on the number of atoms per unit volume, the radius of an atom, and the mean deflection
  angle produced by an atom.
