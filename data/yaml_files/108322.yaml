  Latitudes

tldr: This paper presents meteorological observations made on board the Bark Pagoda
  during its expedition to complete magnetical observations in high southern latitudes.
  The observations include daily measurements of barometer, temperature, and atmospheric
  pressure, as well as the effects of latitude and longitude on these variables. The
  findings show a lower barometer within the tropics and a rapid descent of the mercury
  with the increase of latitude. The paper also compares these results with previous
  observations and discusses the differences in pressure and temperature between equatorial
  and high-latitude regions.
