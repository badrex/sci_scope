revised_title: Investigating the Phlogistication of Spirit of Nitre
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Gas Laws
tldr: The author conducts experiments to understand the phlogistication of spirit
  of nitre and discovers that the process involves the emission of dephlogisticated
  air. The results challenge the phlogiston theory and contribute to the understanding
  of chemical reactions and gas laws.
