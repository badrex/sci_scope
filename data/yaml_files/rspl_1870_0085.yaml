tldr: This article discusses the measurement of the chemical intensity of total daylight
  during the total solar eclipse of December 22, 1870. The authors, Henry E. Roscoe
  and T. E. Thorpe, conducted experiments at Catania, Sicily, and found that the relation
  between total chemical intensity and the sun's altitude is represented by a straight
  line. They also observed that the diminution of total chemical intensity during
  an eclipse is directly proportional to the magnitude of the obscuration.
