revised_title: On the Spectrum of Silicon and the Spectrum of Fluorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of silicon and fluorine, examining the
  behavior of high-temperature lines in different conditions. They find that the silicon
  spectrum from a mixture of silicon and fluorine (dissociated silicon tetra-fluoride)
  is different from that obtained from a similar mixture of silicon and chlorine (dissociated
  silicon tetra-chloride), suggesting that the presence of chlorine extinguishes the
  high-temperature lines.
