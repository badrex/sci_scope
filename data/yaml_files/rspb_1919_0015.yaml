revised_title: Periodic Variations of Conductance of the Palm of the Human Hand
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the periodic variations of conductance in the palm of
  the human hand, observing that conductance values change throughout the day and
  night. The study provides insight into the relationship between nutrition and emotional
  responses, suggesting that emotive effects should be classified as trophic phenomena
  rather than sudomotor effects.
