scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
tldr: The study investigates the development of the branches of the fifth cranial
  nerve in human embryos, focusing on the ophthalmic nerve. The research reveals the
  formation and connections of the ophthalmic nerve, as well as the role of the Gasserian
  ganglion in its development. The findings contribute to the understanding of the
  complex neural pathways and their development in humans.
