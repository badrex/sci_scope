scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Logarithms
tldr: The author presents two theorems for computing logarithms, which can be used
  to derive the logarithms of large fractions from smaller ones or vice versa. These
  theorems offer an alternative method for calculating logarithms, potentially improving
  efficiency and accuracy in various mathematical applications.
