revised_title: 'The Relation between Sunspot and Star Spectra: Implications for Temperature
  and Elemental Abundance'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Astronomy
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between sunspot and star spectra, focusing
  on the elements Vanadium and Titanium. The author finds that sunspots and certain
  stars have similar temperature conditions, suggesting that sunspots may be caused
  by the downrush of cooler material.
