revised_title: Improving Solar Microscopes with Calorific and Colorific Solar Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: J. B. Reade describes a method to improve solar and oxy-hydrogen gas microscopes
  by combining lenses to separate calorific and colorific solar rays. This prevents
  heat from damaging samples and allows for better focus without disturbing the field
  of view.
