revised_title: Electrical Explosions and the Production of Colored Rings on Metal
  Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: Joseph Priestley discovers that electrical explosions on metal surfaces produce
  concentric rings of all prismatic colors. This phenomenon occurs on various metals
  and can be observed on both polished and rough surfaces. The colors appear in an
  oblong figure when the pointed wire is inclined towards the plane of the colors.
