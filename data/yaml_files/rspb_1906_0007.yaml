tldr: This paper examines the Araucariae, both recent and extinct, to understand their
  primitive characteristics and phylogenetic relationships. The authors discuss the
  distribution, anatomy, and reproductive structures of the genera Agathis and Araucaria,
  as well as the fossil records of the Araucarieae. They argue for the Araucariales
  designation and suggest that the Araucarieae may have been derived from Lycopodiaceous
  ancestors.

- Araucaria
