revised_title: 'Solar Changes of Temperature and Variations in Rainfall: Correlating
  Sunspot Cycles with Indian Ocean Climate'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate Science
tldr: The authors investigate the correlation between solar changes, specifically
  sunspot cycles, and variations in rainfall in the region surrounding the Indian
  Ocean. They find that abnormal behavior of widened lines in sunspot spectra is accompanied
  by irregularities in rainfall, and that two pulses of rainfall occur near the maximum
  and minimum of the sunspot period, with famines occurring in the intervals between
  these pulses.
