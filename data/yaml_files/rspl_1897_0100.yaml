revised_title: Investigating the Temperature Coefficients of Iron and Steel Magnets
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the temperature coefficients of various iron and steel
  magnets, focusing on nickel steels, cast irons, and piano wire steels. They find
  that certain types of nickel steels and cast irons can have low or even negative
  temperature coefficients, making them more stable under temperature fluctuations.
