revised_title: Anatomical Study of the Brain in Marsupial Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Anatomy
tldr: The author compares the brain structure of marsupial and placental animals,
  specifically a wombat and a beaver, and finds significant differences in the development
  of the cerebral commissures. The study suggests that marsupials have a less advanced
  brain structure due to their brief intrauterine existence and lack of placental
  connection.
