tldr: The authors investigate the molecular weight of triethylamine, a substituted
  ammonia, and find that the base is not entirely homogeneous. They determine the
  molecular weight of the hydrocarbon molecule C6H12 to be approximately 83,987, which
  supports the idea that hydrogen has an atomic weight slightly less than unity and
  carbon is 12.
