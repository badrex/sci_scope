revised_title: 'Inheritance of Eye-Colour in Man: A Study of Duplex and Simplex Types'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Genetics & Genomics
tldr: 'The author examines the inheritance of eye color in humans, identifying two
  main types: duplex, with both anterior and posterior pigments, and simplex, with
  only posterior pigment. The study finds that eye color is primarily determined by
  iris pigmentation and that it can be inherited through both duplex and simplex matings.'
