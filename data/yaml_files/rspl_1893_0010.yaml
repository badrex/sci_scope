tldr: This paper discusses the harmonic analysis of hourly temperature observations
  at British observatories, focusing on the consistency and variations in temperature
  data over time. The study reveals that the position of the epoch of maximum temperature
  is generally consistent, with periodical variations that depend on the sun's position
  and season.
