revised_title: The Influence of Glass Composition on Electrical Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the chemical composition and
  electrical properties of various types of glass, specifically focusing on the effects
  of lead oxide content. They find that glasses with higher lead oxide content exhibit
  higher conductivity and specific inductive capacity, suggesting a potential correlation
  between these properties and the glass's composition.
