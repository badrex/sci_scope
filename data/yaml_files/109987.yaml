revised_title: Effects of Iron on Chronometers' Rates
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Navigation & Timekeeping
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the effects of iron on chronometers' rates and concludes
  that iron can alter their rates, often causing retardation. He suggests practical
  solutions for placing chronometers on ships to minimize the impact of iron on their
  accuracy.
