revised_title: Stomatal Conductance and Gas Exchange in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the role of stomata in gas exchange in plants, concluding
  that they are the primary pathway for CO2 exchange. They also find that stomata
  offer a much easier path for gas exchange than the cuticle, and that under certain
  conditions, CO2 can pass through the cuticle by osmosis.
