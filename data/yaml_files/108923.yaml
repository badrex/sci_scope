scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the amount and changes of polar magnetism in the iron-built
  ship 'Northumberland' and discusses the effects of iron plating on compass deviations.
  The study provides insights into the magnetic forces and coefficients at different
  positions within the ship.
