tldr: Charles Wheatstone investigates the effects of varying the inclination of the
  optic axes and retinal magnitudes on our perception of object size and distance
  using a novel experimental apparatus. He discovers that convergence of the optic
  axes suggests fixed distance, while variations in retinal magnitude suggest changes
  in distance, leading to paradoxical effects in our perception of objects.
