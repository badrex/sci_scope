revised_title: Determination of Thermal Conductivity of Air and Other Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors present a new method to determine the thermal conductivity of air
  and other gases using parallel plates and an insulating ring. They apply this method
  to measure the thermal conductivity of air at ordinary pressures and find a value
  of 0.0243 W/mK, with a possible increase of 5% if a correction for temperature differences
  is applied.
