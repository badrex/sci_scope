tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the decomposition of monammonium salts under heat
  and discovers that they undergo an analogous decomposition, allowing for both ascent
  and descent in the scale by substituting hydrogen for radicals. He also explores
  the potential for transforming triethylphosphine into diethylphosphine but remains
  unsuccessful.
