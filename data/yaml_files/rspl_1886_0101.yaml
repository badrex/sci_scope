revised_title: 'Improving Calorimetry Methods: The Gravimetric Calorimeter'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author presents a new method of calorimetry, the gravimetric calorimeter,
  which measures the condensation of steam on a substance to determine its specific
  heat. This method improves upon previous techniques and offers a more accurate way
  to measure heat transfer and latent heat of gasification.
topics:
- Calorimetry
- Gravimetric Analysis
- Specific Heat
- Latent Heat
- Heat Transfer
