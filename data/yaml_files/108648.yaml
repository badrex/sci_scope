revised_title: Stratifications and Dark Band in Electrical Discharges in Torricellian
  Vacua
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of stratifications and dark bands in
  electrical discharges in Torricellian vacua using an inductive coil. The experiments
  reveal that the conditions necessary for the appearance of these phenomena include
  a perfect vacuum, the absorption of moisture, and the introduction of vapor from
  naphtha or phosphorus.
