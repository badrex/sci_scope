tldr: The author examines tide observations made in the Indian Seas, focusing on the
  Gulf of Cambay and the entrance of the Persian Gulf. The study reveals a significant
  diurnal inequality in the heights and times of tides, with some locations experiencing
  a range of seven to eight feet in height and a two-hour difference in the time of
  high and low tides. This research contributes to the understanding of tidal phenomena
  in these regions.
