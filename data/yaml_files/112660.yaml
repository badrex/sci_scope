revised_title: Exploring the Theory and Function of Magneto-Electric Machines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: C.F. Varley investigates the function and theory of magneto-electric machines,
  specifically those designed by Wilde, Wheatstone, and Siemens. He examines the role
  of shunts in these machines and suggests alternative methods to improve their efficiency,
  such as using a secondary wire or a copper cylinder to maintain magnetism.
