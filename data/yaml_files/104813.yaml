revised_title: The Disturbing Effect of Glass Electricity on Mariners Compass and
  Balances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author discovers that glass can be disturbed by electricity, which can affect
  the accuracy of mariners compasses and sensitive balances. Wiping the glass surface
  with a wet finger can resolve the issue, suggesting that the problem may arise from
  friction or even atmospheric disturbances like thunder.
