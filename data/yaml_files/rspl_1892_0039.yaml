revised_title: 'Development of Stigmata in Ascidians: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author investigates the development of stigmata in ascidians, focusing on
  the differences between fixed and pelagic species. The study reveals that stigmata
  in fixed ascidians arise through a process of subdivision, while in pelagic species,
  they develop independently. This research sheds light on the evolutionary relationships
  between different types of ascidians and their adaptations to different environments.
