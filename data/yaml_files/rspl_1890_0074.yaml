revised_title: The Influence of Temperature and Concentration on the Passive State
  of Iron and Steel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effects of temperature and concentration of nitric
  acid on the passive state of iron and steel. The experiments show that the passivity
  of iron and steel is influenced by temperature and the concentration of nitric acid,
  with the passivity increasing in stronger acids and at higher temperatures.
