  in Switzerland
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the process of petrification in snail shells found in Switzerland,
  discovering that they are transformed into a metal-like substance through the action
  of sulfur. The shells' transformation is attributed to the presence of sulfur in
  the surrounding environment, which penetrates the shells and hardens over time.
