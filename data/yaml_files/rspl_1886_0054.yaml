revised_title: 'Intensity of Radiation through Turbid Media: Experimental Validation
  of Rayleigh''s Theory'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Abney and Festing experimentally validate Lord Rayleigh's theory on the intensity
  of radiation through turbid media using a thermopile. They investigate the transmission
  of visible light through water with added mastic particles and compare it to transparent
  water, confirming the theory's predictions.
