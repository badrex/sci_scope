  Comparison of Platinum Thermometers and Thermo-Junctions with the Gas Thermometer'

tldr: This paper presents a study on the high temperature standards of the National
  Physical Laboratory, comparing platinum thermometers and thermo-junctions with a
  gas thermometer. The results confirm the use of Callendar's difference formula for
  reducing platinum thermometer readings to the normal scale and show that the instruments'
  readings are in reasonably close agreement with the gas thermometer up to 1000°C.
