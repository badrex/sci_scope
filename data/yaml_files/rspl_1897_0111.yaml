scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Karl Pearson investigates cloudiness frequency using data from Breslau between
  1876 and 1885. He discovers a (J-shaped distribution and applies the theory of skew
  variation to describe this novel form of frequency. The study demonstrates the capacity
  of the theory to cover unusual types of frequency distributions.
