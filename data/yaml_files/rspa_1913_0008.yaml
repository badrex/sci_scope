revised_title: The Penetrating Power of Radium C's Beta-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The author investigates the penetrating power of beta-rays from radium C using
  a strong source and dense mercury as an absorber. The results indicate that there
  is no detectable radiation capable of penetrating 27 cm of mercury, suggesting that
  any very penetrating radiation is either very weak or non-existent.
