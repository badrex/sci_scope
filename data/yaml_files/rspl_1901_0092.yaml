revised_title: On the Stability of the Equilibrium of Fluids in Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the stability of fluid figures in rotation, focusing
  on a pear-shaped figure that is likely stable. The paper aims to simplify the analytical
  conditions for stability and provides a higher degree of approximation using elliptical
  integrals.
