tldr: The author presents a new theory on elasticity and its application to the propagation
  of vibrations and atmospheric phenomena, specifically the barometer. He introduces
  new terms and concepts, such as natural and violent equilibrium, and explains how
  these can be used to understand the behavior of the atmosphere and weather patterns.
