revised_title: Discovery of Bacilli in the Breath of Persons Affected with Phthisis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of bacilli in the condensed aqueous vapor
  of the breath of individuals affected with phthisis (tuberculosis) and find a specific
  bacillus that is indistinguishable from the bacillus found in tubercle. This discovery
  suggests that particles capable of transmitting the disease may be constantly breathed
  in by susceptible individuals.
