revised_title: The Osmotic Pressure and Vapour Pressure in Concentrated Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between osmotic pressure and vapour
  pressure in concentrated solutions. They develop a thermodynamic argument to determine
  the osmotic pressure corresponding to the concentration at the top of a column,
  allowing for a comparison between osmotic and vapour pressures at the same concentrations.
topics:
- Osmotic pressure
- Vapour pressure
- Concentration
- Equilibrium
- Thermodynamics
