revised_title: Characteristics of Impurity in Nitrogen Gas Derived from Urea
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the impurity found in nitrogen gas derived from urea
  and identifies nitrous oxide as the primary cause of the anomaly. The impurity is
  found to be soluble in water and has a higher refractivity than nitrogen, supporting
  the conclusion that nitrous oxide is the main contaminant.
