revised_title: The Effect of Mercury Vapour on the Spectrum of Helium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectral Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the effect of mercury vapour on the spectrum of helium
  in a Plucker's tube. The introduction of mercury vapour simplifies the spectrum
  of the negative glow, causing three helium lines to disappear and a new orange mercury
  line to appear. The presence of helium can be detected in minute traces using a
  delicate test involving a piece of tubing in the central portion of the tube.
