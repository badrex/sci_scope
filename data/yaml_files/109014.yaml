scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of narcotine and its products
  of decomposition. They discover two new bases, normal narcotine (nornarcotine) and
  dimethyl-normal-narcotine (dimethyl-nornarcotine), and analyze their properties
  and reactions. The bases have no significant physiological effects and are derived
  from the replacement of methyl atoms with hydrogen atoms in the narcotine molecule.
