scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author analyzes barometric pressure observations from the Flagstaff Observatory
  in Melbourne to investigate the lunar atmospheric tide. The study reveals a regularity
  in the data, suggesting the moon's influence on the Earth's atmosphere, with some
  irregularities possibly due to the combined action of the sun and moon.
