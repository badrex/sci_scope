revised_title: A Method for Measuring the Diffusion of Salts in Solution
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The authors describe a method for measuring the diffusion of salts in solution
  by observing the movement of salt layers in a two-chambered glass vessel. They demonstrate
  the technique using a chloride of sodium solution and discuss the implications of
  their findings on the understanding of diffusion.
