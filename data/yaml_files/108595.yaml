revised_title: 'Researches on the Action of Sulphuric Acid on Amides and Nitriles:
  Formation of Conjugate Sulpho-Acids'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The authors investigate the reaction of sulfuric acid on amides and nitriles,
  leading to the formation of conjugate sulpho-acids. They focus on the preparation
  and properties of acetonitrile and its reaction with sulfuric acid, resulting in
  a new class of compounds with potential applications in chemistry.
