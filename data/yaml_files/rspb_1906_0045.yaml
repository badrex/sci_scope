  Function

scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Hormones
tldr: This study investigates the effects of pituitary extracts on kidney function,
  specifically focusing on the infundibular part of the gland. Intravenous injections
  of saline extracts from this region lead to dilatation of kidney vessels and increased
  urine flow, indicating a diuretic action. The researchers also discuss the gland's
  relationship to the functions of the suprarenal and thyroid glands and its role
  in acromegaly.
