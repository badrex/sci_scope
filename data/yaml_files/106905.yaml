  and Water to Those by Measure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Quantitative Analysis
tldr: The author presents tables for calculating the proportions of spirit and water
  in mixtures by weight and measure, allowing for the determination of specific gravities
  and concentrations at various temperatures. These tables can be used to calculate
  the excise duty on spirituous liquors based on the proportion of pure spirit in
  the mixture.
