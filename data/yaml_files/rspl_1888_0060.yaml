  and Rainfall

tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the diurnal barometric maxima
  and critical conditions of temperature, cloud, and rainfall. The study reveals that
  the forenoon maximum of the barometric oscillation approximately coincides with
  the most rapid rise of temperature, suggesting that the atmospheric pressure is
  influenced by heating and expansion of the atmosphere.
