revised_title: 'The Enzymes of Emulsin: Hydrolysis and Synthesis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: 'The authors investigate the enzymes present in emulsin, specifically focusing
  on amygdalin hydrolysis and enzyme specificity. They discover that emulsin contains
  three enzymes: gluco-lactase, Î²-glucase, and amygdalase. The study emphasizes the
  importance of enzymes as diagnostic agents and the challenges in separating and
  purifying them for further analysis.'
