revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of a Lyrae
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: John Pond, Astronomer Royal, investigates the parallax of a Lyrae star using
  the mural circle and the method of reflection. He finds that the absolute parallax
  of a Lyrae does not exceed a small fraction of a second and discusses the potential
  effects of temperature on the observations.
