scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the life-history of dimorphic Foraminifera, specifically
  focusing on the differences in size and shape of central chambers, as well as the
  distinct nuclear characters of the megalospheric and microspheric forms. The study
  provides evidence that both forms can produce megalospheric young under certain
  circumstances, and discusses the possible origins of these forms.
