  Frequencies
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author analyzes data from Kew magnetographs on quiet days between 1890 and
  1900, investigating the relationship between magnetic phenomena and sunspot frequencies.
  The study reveals a connection between the non-cyclic effect in the diurnal variation
  and sunspot frequency, as well as a comparison between magnetic and meteorological
  phenomena at Kew.
