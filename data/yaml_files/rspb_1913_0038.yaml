scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathogen Biology
tldr: The study investigates the morphology of various strains of the trypanosome
  causing disease in humans in Nyasaland, focusing on the wild-game strain. The researchers
  compare the morphology of the trypanosome strains isolated from antelopes with the
  human strains, providing insights into disease transmission and potential treatment
  options.
