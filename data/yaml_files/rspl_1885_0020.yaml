tldr: The author presents results from magnetic observations conducted at the Royal
  Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1876. The study investigates the diurnal changes
  in magnetism and their relationship to solar heat, concluding that the main cause
  of these changes is due to the radiant heat of the sun.
