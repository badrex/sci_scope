revised_title: Cortical Lamination and Localization in the Marmoset's Brain
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the cortical lamination and localization in the brain
  of the marmoset, examining the extent and boundaries of different types of cortex
  and their correlation with the animal's functions and habits. They describe the
  brain's structure, the motor area, and the post-central area, providing insights
  into the brain's organization and function in this species.
