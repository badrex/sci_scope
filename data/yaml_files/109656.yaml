tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the inconvertibility of bark into alburnum
  through a series of experiments and observations. He concludes that bark remains
  in its state and does not convert into alburnum, contrary to the beliefs of some
  naturalists. The study also highlights the differences in bark textures and the
  adhesion between bark layers, providing evidence against the theory of conversion.
