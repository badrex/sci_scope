revised_title: The Detection of Nitrous Acid in Urine After Ammonia Consumption
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the oxidation of ammonia in the human body and the presence
  of nitrous acid in urine. They find that distillation with phosphoric acid does
  not effectively detect nitrous acid, while distillation with sulfuric acid is more
  successful. The presence of nitrous acid is detected after consuming ammonia, suggesting
  a connection between ammonia consumption and nitrous acid production in the body.
