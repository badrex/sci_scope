revised_title: 'The Croonian Lecture on Muscular Motion: Exploring the Muscular Power
  in Hydatids'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the muscular power in hydatids, simple organisms with no
  visible muscular structure, and discovers that they possess a similar power to human
  muscles, suggesting that the complexity of muscle structure in more advanced animals
  is not essential for contraction and relaxation.
