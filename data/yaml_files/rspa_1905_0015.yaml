revised_title: Influence of Fluorescence on Absorption and the Role of Molecular Aggregations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between fluorescence and absorption,
  proposing that the change in absorption is due to the formation of unstable molecular
  aggregates during the period of luminosity. The study also highlights the importance
  of considering the intensity of fluorescence in understanding the change in absorption.
