revised_title: On the General Integrals of Equations of Internal Equilibrium in Elastic
  Solids
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the general integrals of equations related to the internal
  equilibrium of elastic solids, focusing on the coefficients of elasticity and the
  potential energy of elastic forces. The study is limited to homogeneous bodies with
  constant and uniform temperature, and the method of solution is outlined in detail.
topics:
- Elasticity Theory
- Solid Mechanics
- Internal Equilibrium
- Orthogonal Axes
- Coefficients of Elasticity
