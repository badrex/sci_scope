revised_title: Compressibilities of Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Carbonic Oxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author presents preliminary findings on the compressibilities of oxygen,
  hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide between one and half an atmosphere of pressure.
  The study aims to determine the atomic weights of the elements involved and provides
  a foundation for further research on gas properties.
topics:
- Compressibility
- Atomic Weights
- Gas Properties
- Pressure
- Isotermal Expansion
