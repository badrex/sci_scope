revised_title: On the Electric Current's Effects in Fluid Conductors
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: J.F.W. Herschel investigates the motion of fluids when conducting electric currents,
  observing that the motion's strength varies with the type of liquid and metal used.
  He also notes the influence of impurities and the properties of different metals
  when in contact with mercury. The author suggests that these phenomena may be explained
  by the differences in conducting power between metals and liquids, and the chemical
  or electrical relations between them.
