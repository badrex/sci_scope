scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The author investigates the asymptotic expansions of integral functions with
  a single essential singularity at infinity, focusing on simple integral functions
  with non-repeated and repeated sequences of zeros. The study also explores the applications
  of these expansions in determining the number of roots and the order of functions.
