revised_title: Investigating the Laws and Operation of Electrical Force in Planar
  Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between electrical charge, surface area,
  and boundary extension in planar surfaces, discovering that electrical charge depends
  on both surface area and linear extension. The study also reveals that electrical
  intensity varies inversely with surface area and boundary extension.

- Electrical Charge
- Electrical Intensity
- Electrometer Indications
- Surface and Boundary Extension
