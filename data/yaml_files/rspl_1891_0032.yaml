revised_title: A New Method for Air Thermometer Compensation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author develops a new method for air thermometer compensation, using a sulphuric
  acid gauge and a standard constant pressure to improve accuracy and simplify calculations.
  This method allows for more precise temperature measurements and eliminates the
  need for certain corrections, making it a valuable tool for scientific research.
