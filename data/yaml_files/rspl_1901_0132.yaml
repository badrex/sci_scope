revised_title: The Influence of Minerals on Protoplasmic Streaming in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of mineral deficiencies on protoplasmic
  streaming in plants, finding that the lack of certain minerals affects the development
  of mycelium and spores. The study suggests that differences in mineral supply can
  impact the host plant's growth and, in turn, the parasite's development.
