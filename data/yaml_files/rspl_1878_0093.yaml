revised_title: 'Improving the Balance for Precise Measurements: A Method to Determine
  the Mean Density of the Earth'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Measurement
tldr: The author presents a method to improve the balance's accuracy for measuring
  small differences and demonstrates its application in determining the mean density
  of the Earth. The method involves minimizing external forces and temperature effects,
  and using a specially designed balance and experimental setup.
topics:
- Balance Accuracy
- Density of the Earth
- Experimental Techniques
- Temperature Effects
- Torsion Balance
