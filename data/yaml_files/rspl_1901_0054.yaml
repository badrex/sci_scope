revised_title: The Measurement and Analysis of Magnetic Hysteresis
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors develop a method to measure magnetic hysteresis using an electro-dynamometer
  and a ballistic galvanometer. They find that the cyclic B-H curve is not always
  symmetrical, and discuss the effects of annealing, stretching, and torsion on the
  hysteresis behavior of iron wires.
