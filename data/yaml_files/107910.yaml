revised_title: Elliptic Polarization and the Action of Metals on Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of elliptic polarization and its relation
  to the interaction of metals and light. The study reveals that metals reflect and
  polarize light in distinct ways, leading to the formation of unique optical properties
  and phenomena.
