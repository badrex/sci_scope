scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the ascent of sap in trees and discovers that
  the sap moves through the bark from the leaves to the stem. He also identifies two
  types of vessels in the leaves, central vessels, and returning vessels, which play
  a role in the movement of sap and nutrients within the tree.
