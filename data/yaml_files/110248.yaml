revised_title: 'The Electric Origin of Terrestrial Magnetism: A New Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the electric origin of all phenomena related to terrestrial
  magnetism and demonstrates that the effects of terrestrial magnetism can be produced
  by electricity alone. He also suggests that magnetism is not essentially distinct
  from electricity.
