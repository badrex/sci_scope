revised_title: 'Photometric Observations of the Sun and Sky: Investigating the Intensity
  Distribution of Sunlight and Sky Light'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts photometric observations of the sun and sky using sensitized
  paper and a water motionometer, discovering that the chemical action of the sun
  remains constant throughout the day and year, while the chemical action of the sky
  varies depending on its location and altitude.
topics:
- Sunlight Intensity
- Sky Light Intensity
- Photometry
- Actinometry
- Sensitised Paper
