revised_title: The Influence of Water Vapor in the Solar Spectrum and Solar Temperature
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of water vapor in the atmosphere on the
  solar spectrum and solar temperature. They confirm the correctness of Langley's
  wave-lengths and find that the absorption by water vapor coincides with the absorption
  bands in the solar spectrum.
