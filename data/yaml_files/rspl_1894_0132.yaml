revised_title: 'Electrical Interference Phenomena: A Study of Waves Along Wires and
  Their Analogous Relationship to Newton''s Rings'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena similar to Newton's
  rings, but exhibited by waves along wires. The study involves the use of an electrometer
  and various experimental setups to analyze the behavior of electrical waves and
  their reflections, leading to a better understanding of the underlying mathematical
  theory and its applications.
