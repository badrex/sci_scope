tldr: The author examines the functions of the membrana tympani, ossicles, and Eustachian
  tube in the human ear, revealing their roles in hearing and protecting the ear from
  loud vibrations and foreign substances. The study also demonstrates that the Eustachian
  tubes are typically closed, and the tympanum functions best as a closed cavity for
  hearing.
