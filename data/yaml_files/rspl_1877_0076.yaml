revised_title: Investigating the Anomalous Movements of Radiometers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments with radiometers and observes anomalous movements
  under certain conditions. By analyzing the effects of heat and radiation, the author
  suggests that the movements are caused by the interaction between the outer and
  inner layers of the radiometer's glass bulb.
