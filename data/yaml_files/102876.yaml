  Human Body
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology & Pathology
tldr: The author shares two case studies of patients who experienced severe health
  issues due to prune ingestion. In the first case, a man died after consuming a large
  amount of prunes, leading to prune-stones perforating the intestinum rectum. In
  the second case, a 14-year-old boy suffered from a severe illness, which was traced
  back to a breach in the gut ileon. The author discusses the dissection and autopsy
  results of both patients, providing insights into the effects of prune consumption
  on the human body.
