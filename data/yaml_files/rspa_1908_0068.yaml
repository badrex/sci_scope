scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author searches for new members of the inactive series of gases and examines
  the properties of emanations from radium, thorium, and actinium. Although no new
  gases are found, the study provides insight into the atomic weights and stability
  of these elements and their potential placement in the periodic table.
