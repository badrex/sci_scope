scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines two small fossil reptile specimens from Klipfontein, Fraserburg,
  and discusses their structure, organization, and classification. The findings suggest
  that these specimens may belong to a distinct group separate from both Cynodontia
  and Gomphodontia. Additionally, the text includes a separate section on the evolution
  of the vertebral column in fish.
