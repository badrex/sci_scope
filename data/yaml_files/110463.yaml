revised_title: Experimental Analysis of Tricuspid Valve Function in Heart Circulation
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular System
tldr: Thomas Wilkinson King's paper investigates the function of the tricuspid valve
  in the heart's circulation. He experimentally proves that the tricuspid valve does
  not completely prevent the reflux of blood from the ventricle into the auricle on
  the right side. The author also highlights the anatomical differences between the
  auriculo-ventricular valves and their respective functions.
