  Muscle'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the electrical phenomena in animal nerves and muscles,
  discovering that they supply currents to the galvanometer and that the surface composed
  of the sides and ends of the fibers have opposite electrical conditions. The study
  also explores the motor phenomena ascribed to the action of inverse and direct voltaic
  currents.
