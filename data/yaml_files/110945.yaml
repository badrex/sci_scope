revised_title: Explaining the Phenomena of Repulsion between Negatively Electric Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: James A. Smith suggests that in negatively electrified bodies, the redundant
  electric matter tends to escape, leading to a destroyed equilibrium of cohesion.
  As a result, two such bodies repel each other, confirming Franklin's theory of electrostatics.
