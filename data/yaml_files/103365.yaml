revised_title: Investigating the Suspension of Water and Quicksilver in Glass Tubes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to understand the suspension of water and quicksilver
  in glass tubes. He demonstrates that the suspension is not due to the attraction
  of the glass tube's inner surface, but rather the balance of atmospheric pressure
  and the cohesive force of the liquid column.

- Capillary action
- Atmospheric pressure
- Vacuum
- Cohesion
- Surface tension
