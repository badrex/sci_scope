revised_title: Experiments on the Production of Cold by Evaporation of the Sulphuret
  of Carbon

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: Alexander Marcet investigates the production of cold by the evaporation of the
  sulphuret of carbon. He finds that the substance is highly volatile and capable
  of producing a significant degree of cold through evaporation. The experiments demonstrate
  that the degree of cold produced is influenced by the hygrometrical state of the
  atmosphere and the temperature of the sulphuret of carbon.
