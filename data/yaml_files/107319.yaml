revised_title: Further Investigations on the Nature of Muriatic and Oxymuriatic Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author conducts additional experiments on muriatic and oxymuriatic acids,
  investigating their properties and reactions. The experiments reveal that the electrization
  of muriatic acid gas over mercury results in the formation of muriate of mercury,
  hydrogen, and oxymuriatic acid. The author also explores the limitations of the
  electric effect on muriatic acid gas and the role of hydrogen in these reactions.
