  System

tldr: James Johnstone investigates the role of ganglions in nerve function and the
  nervous system, specifically examining their relationship to spinal and sympathetic
  nerves. He conducts experiments on kittens and frogs, demonstrating that ganglions
  do not hinder the irritation of spinal marrow from causing convulsions in voluntary
  muscles, but do prevent that cause from affecting the heart and intestines. This
  suggests that ganglions play a crucial role in the nervous system and may have implications
  for understanding and treating nervous diseases.
