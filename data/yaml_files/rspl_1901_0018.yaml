scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors analyze the mineral composition of dust and soot from various sources,
  including atmospheric dust, volcanic dust, and flue dust. They find that some dust
  samples contain elements commonly found in meteorites, suggesting a cosmic origin
  for the material. The study contributes to the understanding of the composition
  of atmospheric dust and its potential sources.
