tldr: The author investigates the structure and function of the liver, focusing on
  the secretory apparatus and biliary ducts. They argue against the existence of a
  lobular biliary plexus and propose a new arrangement of the liver's structures,
  with epithelial cells lining the interlobular ducts and contributing to the secretion
  process.
