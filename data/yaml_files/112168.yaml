scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Compounds
tldr: The authors investigate the synthesis and properties of various ethers, specifically
  focusing on the synthesis of carboketonic ethers from acetic ethers. They describe
  the production of ethylic diethacetone carbonate, diethylated acetone, ethylic ethacetone
  carbonate, and ethylated acetone, as well as their chemical properties and reactions.
