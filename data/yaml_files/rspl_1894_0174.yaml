revised_title: The Endothermic Nature of Acetylene and its Role in Luminosity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the cause of luminosity in hydrocarbon gas flames and
  concludes that the endothermic nature of acetylene plays a significant role in the
  incandescence of carbon particles within the flame. The decomposition of acetylene
  into carbon and hydrogen at high temperatures is responsible for the intense light
  emitted.
