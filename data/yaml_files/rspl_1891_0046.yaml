revised_title: 'Electrolysis of Silver Nitrate in Vacuo: Effects of Dissolved Oxygen
  on Deposits'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Techniques
tldr: The authors investigate the electrolysis of silver nitrate in a vacuum and find
  that deposits are slightly larger when conducted in vacuo compared to when exposed
  to air. They attribute this difference to the effects of dissolved oxygen, as deposits
  are smaller when electrolysis is carried out in an atmosphere of oxygen.
