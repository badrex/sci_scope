  in Fluids

scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the impact of compressible bodies and the effects of
  compression in fluids. They demonstrate that when there is discontinuity in the
  tendency to compression in a material system, all the consequences of collision
  can occur, including the instantaneous transmission of a finite amount of momentum
  from one part of the system to another.
