revised_title: Chemical Composition and Internal Structure of a Meteoric Iron from
  Winburg, Orange Free State
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteoritics & Planetary Science
tldr: This study investigates the chemical composition and internal structure of a
  meteorite from Winburg, Orange Free State. The meteorite is primarily composed of
  iron and nickel with some carbon, phosphorus, and silicon. The internal structure
  reveals large ferrite crystals separated by iron-nickel alloy veins, with fine crystallites
  embedded in the ferrite. The meteorite's unique structure is characterized by 'Widmannstatten
  figures' and exhibits interesting properties such as malleability and magnetic susceptibility.
