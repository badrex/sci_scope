revised_title: Investigating Spontaneous Electrical Currents in Telegraph Wires
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates spontaneous electrical currents observed in telegraph
  wires and discovers that they do not arise from the transit of electricity between
  the atmosphere and the earth. Instead, the currents travel along the wires from
  one earth connection to another, alternating in direction. The study also reveals
  a diurnal pattern in the currents' behavior.
