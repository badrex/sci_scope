  Lands and California
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Cartography
tldr: Arthur Dobbs disputes Captain Behring's claim that the newly discovered lands

  there may still be a large opening between these lands and California, potentially
  allowing for a passage from Hudson's Bay to the Western American Ocean.
