revised_title: 'On the Resistance and Electromotive Forces of the Electric Arc: A
  New Approach to Definition and Measurement'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors propose a new definition and method for measuring the resistance
  and electromotive forces of the electric arc, distinguishing between irreversible
  and reversible energy transfer. They argue that the arc's resistance and electromotive
  force can be determined by varying the current and observing the energy transfers
  under constant conditions.
