scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author compares the values of magnetic elements from the British magnetic
  survey of 1891 with recent observations at various locations. The study reveals
  discrepancies in the survey values, particularly in declination, horizontal force,
  and dip, which have changed over time.
