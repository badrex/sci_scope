revised_title: The Rhythmical Mechanism of Stromboli's Volcanic Eruptions
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Seismology
tldr: The author investigates the unique rhythmical intermittence and recurrence of
  Stromboli's volcanic eruptions, distinguishing it from other volcanoes. He proposes
  a mechanism involving the tension of heated steam or water within the volcano, which
  is affected by atmospheric pressure, leading to eruptions.
