  Structure
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geothermal Studies
tldr: The author examines the rate of increase of temperature beneath the Earth's
  surface and its relation to geological structure. The study includes observations
  from coal mines, other mines, and artesian wells, aiming to provide a more accurate
  and restricted range for the thermometric gradient.
topics:
- Geothermal gradient
- Geology
- Temperature in mines
- Artesian wells
