scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: Petrus Van Muschenbroek investigates the properties of Indian Magnetick-Sand,
  experimenting with various methods to increase its magnetic force. He discovers
  that the sand's magnetic properties can be enhanced through exposure to specific
  substances and heating processes, but cautions that further research is needed to
  understand the nature of this material.
