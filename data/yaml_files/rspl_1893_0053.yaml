revised_title: Magnetic Properties of Iron and Hysteresis Losses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic qualities of various iron specimens, focusing
  on the energy lost due to magnetic hysteresis during cyclic magnetizing processes.
  They observe that different specimens have varying hysteresis losses and that high
  permeability does not necessarily imply low hysteresis losses. The authors also
  discuss the Steinmetz formula for hysteresis losses and present experiments on heat
  developed in magnetic reversals and the time-lag in magnetization.
