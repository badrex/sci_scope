revised_title: Determination of Surface Tension of Water Using Jet Vibration Method
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Surface Phenomena
tldr: The authors use the jet vibration method proposed by Lord Rayleigh to determine
  the surface tension of water. They supplement Rayleigh's theory with corrections
  for the influence of finite amplitudes and viscosity. The surface tension of water
  at 12Â°C is found to be 73.23 dynes/cm.
