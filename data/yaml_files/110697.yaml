revised_title: The Solubility of Silica by Steam in the East Indies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: Julius Jeffreys investigates the solubility of silica by steam in the East Indies
  and observes that siliceous materials are partially consumed when exposed to high-temperature
  steam. He also notes that previous experiments failed to show solubility due to
  insufficient heat.
