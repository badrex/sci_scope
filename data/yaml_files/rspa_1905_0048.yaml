revised_title: 'The Formation of Ice and the Grained Structure of Glaciers: A Study
  of Foam-Walls and Foam-Cells'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryology
tldr: The author investigates the formation of ice and the structure of glaciers,
  revealing that ice is a liquid jelly with foam-walls containing foam-cells filled
  with pure or nearly pure water. The author also explains the role of surface tension
  and salt concentration in the formation of glacier grains and the effects of temperature
  and pressure on ice.
