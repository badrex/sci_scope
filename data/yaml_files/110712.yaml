tldr: The author examines the minute structure and movements of voluntary muscles,
  confirming the existence of primitive fasciculi composed of fibrils with alternating
  dark and light points. He also describes the sarcolemma, a delicate membrane surrounding
  each fasciculus, and provides observations on muscle contraction and the union between
  tendons and muscles.
