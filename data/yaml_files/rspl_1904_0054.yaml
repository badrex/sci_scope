revised_title: Formation of Unstable Compounds Between Proteids and Chloroform in
  Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Proteins
tldr: The authors investigate the interaction between chloroform and proteids in solutions,
  discovering that an unstable compound forms between proteids and chloroform. This
  compound's instability suggests that it may play a role in the process of anaesthesia,
  as it can be broken down when the pressure of the anaesthetic is reduced.
