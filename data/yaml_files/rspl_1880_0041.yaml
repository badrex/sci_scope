  lotor)
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the female organs and placenta of the racoon, finding a
  zonary or annular placenta and unique placental vessels. The study also reveals
  the absence of an umbilical vesicle in the racoon fetus and the presence of a supernumerary
  cuticle or epitridermia. These findings contribute to the understanding of racoon
  reproduction and the classification of mammalia.
