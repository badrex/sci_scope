revised_title: Investigation of Homogeneous β-Rays Absorption by Matter and the Variation
  of Absorption with Velocity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Particle Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors study the absorption of homogeneous β-rays by matter and find that
  the absorption follows a linear, not exponential, law. They also observe that the
  absorption varies with the velocity of the rays, with faster rays being less absorbed
  by the same thickness of matter.
