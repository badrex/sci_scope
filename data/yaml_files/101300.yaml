revised_title: Predicting the Variations of the Magnetick Needle for Future Years
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author presents a table predicting the variations of the magnetic needle
  for the following years, based on a hypothesis by Mr. Henry Bond. The hypothesis
  suggests that the needle's variations are now westward and were eastward in the
  past. The table aims to encourage observations to verify or invalidate the proposed
  theory.
