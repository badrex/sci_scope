revised_title: Magnetisation Effects on the Dimensions of Iron Rings and Rods
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the changes in dimensions of iron rings and rods due
  to magnetisation, discovering that the elongation decreases when the magnetising
  force is increased beyond a certain limit. The study also highlights the challenges
  faced in conducting experiments with iron rings, such as heat generation and maintaining
  a uniform magnetic field.
