tldr: The author describes the effects of a storm on sea water and its impact on windows
  and the environment. He observes that sea water particles can be carried far inland
  during a storm and can cause damage to windows and other structures. Using a microscope,
  he examines the salt particles in the water and concludes that they can be beneficial
  to the soil, potentially increasing its fertility.
