revised_title: 'The Distribution of Electric Force in the Crookes Dark Space: A New
  Method for Measuring Potential'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the distribution of electric
  force in the Crookes dark space using a beam of cathode rays. The method involves
  a secondary tube that delivers a homogeneous beam of cathode rays, allowing for
  the determination of electric force at various points within the dark space.
topics:
- Electric Force
- Crookes Dark Space
- Cathode Rays
