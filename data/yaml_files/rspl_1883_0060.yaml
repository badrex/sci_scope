  Food

scientific_subdiscipline: Agriculture & Soil Science
tldr: The authors analyze the chemical composition of the ashes of various animals,
  including oxen, sheep, and pigs, and discuss the implications of their findings
  for animal food consumption. They note that as animals mature, the percentage of
  nitrogenous substance decreases, while the percentage of fat and total dry matter
  increases. The authors also estimate the loss of mineral constituents to the farm
  due to the production and sale of fattening animals and compare it to the loss from
  other agricultural products.
