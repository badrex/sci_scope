revised_title: Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance of Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Properties of Materials
tldr: This study investigates the effects of mechanical stress on the electrical resistance
  of metals, specifically copper, iron, and steel wires. The authors found that stretching
  the wires caused a temporary alteration in specific resistance, but no permanent
  changes unless there was permanent stretching. The results suggest that mechanical
  treatment does not significantly affect the electrical properties of the tested
  metals, unlike the impact of impurities.
