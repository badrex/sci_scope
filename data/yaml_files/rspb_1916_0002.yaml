revised_title: The Relationship between Body Weight and Body Length in Growing Humans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between body weight and body length
  (stem-length) in growing humans. The author finds that body length can be correctly
  expressed as a function of body weight and follows the formula l = kW^n, where l
  is the length of the body, W is the weight, k is a constant, and n has an approximate
  value of 0.33. The findings show that this formula holds for boys up to the age
  of 15 years and weights of 51,000 grams (8 stone 1 lb.).
