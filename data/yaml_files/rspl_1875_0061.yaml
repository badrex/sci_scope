revised_title: Experiments on the Friction between Water and Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the friction between water and
  air, focusing on the jet's velocity, pressure, and radius. They explore the effects
  of different gases and materials on the friction and discuss the possibility of
  a slipping action between the air and water jet.
