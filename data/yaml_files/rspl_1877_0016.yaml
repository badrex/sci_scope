revised_title: On the Continuity of Static and Kinetic Friction at Low Velocities
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The authors, Fleeming Jenkin and J. A. Ewing, investigate the relationship between
  static and kinetic friction at low velocities. They find that in certain cases,
  the coefficient of friction increases as the velocity decreases, suggesting a continuity
  between the two types of friction.
