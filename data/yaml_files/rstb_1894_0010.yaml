tldr: This study investigates the germination of pollen grains and the nutrition of
  pollen tubes, focusing on the role of enzymes in the process. The author finds evidence
  of diastase, invertase, and a cytolytic enzyme in pollen grains, which play a crucial
  role in the germination and growth of pollen tubes.
