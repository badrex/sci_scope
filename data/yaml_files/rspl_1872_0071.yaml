tldr: The authors investigate the nature and physiological effects of the poison from
  the Indian cobra (Naja tripudians) and other venomous snakes, finding that death
  is primarily caused by the poison's action on nerve centers. They also explore potential
  treatment methods, such as artificial respiration, to counteract the lethal effects
