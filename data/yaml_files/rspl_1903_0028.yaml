revised_title: Bactericidal Action of Ultra-Violet Radiations in Arc Spectra
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the bactericidal effects of ultra-violet radiations
  produced by the continuous-current arc on various bacteria species. They find that
  the bactericidal action is confined to the ultra-violet region of the spectrum,
  with the most effective wavelengths being between 3287 and 2265. The study suggests
  that any source of light used as a bactericidal agent should be rich in these rays.
