scientific_subdiscipline: Naval & Marine Engineering
tldr: The author presents a method for rowing men of war in a calm using perpendicular
  revolving oars, which can potentially improve the efficiency and speed of naval
  vessels. The invention offers advantages over traditional oar systems, such as reduced
  time spent on raising and recovering oars, increased uniformity in vessel movement,
  and the ability to support more rowers with fewer oars.
