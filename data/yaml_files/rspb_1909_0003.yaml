scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Metabolism
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the cause of endemic goitre,
  finding that it is likely due to a living organism in the water. They also discovered
  that intestinal parasites, specifically amoebic infection, may be related to the
  disease. The research was conducted in Gilgit, Kashmir, and the findings only apply
  to goitre in that region.
