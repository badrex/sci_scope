revised_title: Investigation of Moving Striations in Neon and Helium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Properties of Materials
tldr: The authors study the moving striations in neon and helium gases using a rotating
  mirror and find that the velocity of the striations is roughly proportional to the
  inverse square root of the pressure. They also observe that the striations' velocity
  and appearance are affected by factors such as gas purity, tube diameter, and temperature
  changes.
