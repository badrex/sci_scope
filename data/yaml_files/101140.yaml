  Opinions'

scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: Sir Samuel Moreland challenges the common belief that weight requirements for
  raising water increase proportionally with height. He proposes a method to force
  water 60 feet high using only triple the weight needed for 20 feet, and suggests
  that wider barrels require unnecessary weight in the engine.
