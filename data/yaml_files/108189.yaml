scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the colors of mixed plates and nacrite substances, discovering
  that the intensity of the colors depends on the size of the cavities and the number
  of edges present. The study also reveals that the colors are produced by the edges
  of the cavities and can be observed using a microscope and various lighting conditions.
