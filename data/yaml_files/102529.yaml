scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, Dr. Christopher Pitt, describes his observations of the stomach's
  motion in a dog, noting the peristaltic movement and the role of the pylorus in
  the digestive process. He suggests that the motion is caused by the stretching of
  the stomach's fibers and is essential for the distribution of nourishment.
