revised_title: Determination of Floating Positions and Stability of Bodies on Fluid
  Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics
tldr: The author presents a geometric analysis to determine the positions and stability
  of floating bodies on fluid surfaces, focusing on the specific case of a cylinder.
  The study involves calculating the specific gravity and dimensions of the cylinder
  to determine whether it will float permanently, be in a state of insensible equilibrium,
  or overset.
