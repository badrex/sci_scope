revised_title: Experiments on the Cohesion of Lead
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the cohesion of lead balls and
  finds that the force required to separate them varies depending on the surface area
  of contact. The experiments demonstrate that cohesion is influenced by the contact
  area and weight applied to the balls.
