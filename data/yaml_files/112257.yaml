scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a general theory for calculating strains in beams, considering
  forces acting in one plane. The theory allows for numerical calculations of strains
  in every point of a beam's interior and can be applied to various beam configurations
  and loading conditions.
