revised_title: 'Researches on Myohaematin and the Histohaematins: A Study of Animal
  Pigments and Their Role in Tissue Respiration'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of a series of animal pigments called histohaematins
  and myohaematin in various organs and tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates.
  These pigments are not identical to any known decomposition product of haemoglobin
  and are found in animals without haemoglobin. The author concludes that these pigments
  play a role in tissue respiration and are involved in the internal respiration of
  the tissues and organs where they are found.
