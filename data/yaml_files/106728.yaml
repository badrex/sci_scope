revised_title: 'A Doubler of Electricity: A Machine for Detecting Minute Quantities
  of Electricity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author invents a doubler machine that can amplify minute quantities of electricity,
  making it easier to detect and measure atmospheric electricity. The device is useful
  for studying the relationship between changes in aerial currents and vegetation
  growth.
