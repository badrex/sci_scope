revised_title: 'Influence of Temperature on the Rigidity of Metals: A Further Study'
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics of Materials & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the rigidity of metals
  using a torsion balance and discovers that metals with lower melting points exhibit
  greater variations in rigidity with temperature. The study also highlights the influence
  of internal viscosity on the measurements and the importance of considering both
  rigidity and viscosity when examining the temperature effects on metals.
