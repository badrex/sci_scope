scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Ayrton and Perry investigate the contact theory of voltaic action, exploring
  the relationship between metals, electrolytes, and the electromotive force in voltaic
  cells. They propose that the nature of metals and electrolytes determines the electromotive
  force, similar to how the nature of metals and temperature distribution determine
  the electromotive force in a thermocouple.
