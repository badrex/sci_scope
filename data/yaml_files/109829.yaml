scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: James Rennell investigates the current that often prevails to the westward of
  the Scilly Islands and its impact on navigation. He collects new instances of the
  current's effects, confirming its course from Cape Finisterre to Scilly and providing
  clearer proof of its strength. Rennell also discusses the current's influence on
  tides and the potential dangers it poses to vessels passing through St. George's
  Channel.
