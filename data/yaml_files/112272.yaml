revised_title: The Artificial Production of Fibrin from Albumen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Biophysics
tldr: The author investigates the process of converting albumen into fibrin through
  the addition of oxygen and varying temperatures. The study demonstrates that the
  presence of alkaline salts can affect the formation of fibrin, and that the use
  of egg-white and defibrinated blood can produce fibrin more effectively.
