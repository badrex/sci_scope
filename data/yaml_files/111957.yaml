revised_title: 'Electrolysis-Induced Vibrations and Sounds: Influence of Electrodes,
  Electrolytes, and Circuit Components'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author, George Gore, investigates the production of vibrations and sounds
  through electrolysis and examines the influence of various factors such as electrodes,
  electrolytes, and circuit components. He concludes that the vibrations are of electrochemical
  origin, resulting from an attraction between the mercury of the negative electrode
  and the mercury of the electrolyte.
