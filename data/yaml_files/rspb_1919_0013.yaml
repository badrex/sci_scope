scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Allergies
tldr: This article explores the biological significance of anaphylaxis, a phenomenon
  first recognized by Richet. It discusses the development of increased susceptibility
  to certain proteins in animals, the specificity of this sensitiveness, and the relationship
  between anaphylaxis and immunity. The author also examines the symptoms and potential
  theories behind anaphylactic reactions, suggesting that further study may shed light
  on the action of poisonous protein derivatives and the physiology of cells.
