tldr: The article discusses the mysterious'vegetable fly' found in the island of Dominica,
  which buries itself in the ground, grows into a tree-like structure, and produces
  small pods that turn into worms and eventually flies. The author explores various
  theories and descriptions of this phenomenon, ultimately concluding that it is a
  unique combination of a fungus and an insect, rather than a fly that can vegetate.
