scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical properties and pharmacological actions
  of arrow-poison used by the Wa Nyika and other tribes of East Equatorial Africa.
  They identify a crystalline gluco-sidal active principle in the poison, which is
  also present in the wood it is prepared from. The study provides insights into the
  composition and effects of the arrow-poison, contributing to the understanding of
  its use in warfare and hunting.
