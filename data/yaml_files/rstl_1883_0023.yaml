revised_title: Determination of Electrostatic Units in the Electromagnetic Unit of
  Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate various methods to determine the number of electrostatic
  units in the electromagnetic unit of electricity, employing a modified version of
  Maxwell's method. They find that the time constant of their system is small compared
  to the charging and discharging times of the condenser, allowing for accurate calculations
  of the electromagnetic measure of the capacity.
