  Derivatives
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author examines the action of hydrobromic acid on codeia and its derivatives,
  resulting in the formation of new compounds such as bromotetracodeia, deoxycodeia,
  and bromotetramorphia. The study provides insights into the chemical reactions and
  properties of these compounds, contributing to the understanding of opium alkaloids.
