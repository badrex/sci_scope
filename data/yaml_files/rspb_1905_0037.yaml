revised_title: A Quantitative Study of Carbon-Dioxide Assimilation and Leaf-Temperature
  in Natural Illumination
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between carbon-dioxide assimilation,
  leaf-temperature, and natural illumination in plants. They find that the internal
  temperature of leaves exposed to natural light is a significant factor affecting
  the rate of carbon-dioxide assimilation, and that direct sunlight can cause a considerable
  rise in leaf temperature.
