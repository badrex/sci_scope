revised_title: Optical Properties and Chromatic Variations of a New Chromic Oxalate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The author discovers a new chromic oxalate with unique optical properties, including
  pleochroism, where the crystal appears in different colors depending on the angle
  of light transmission. The salt has the formula K3Ca(C2O4)4Â·4H2O and can be prepared
  through various methods. The author also discusses the crystal's solubility, stability,
  and color variations under different conditions.
