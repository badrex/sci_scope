revised_title: 'The Sucroclastic Action of Acids and Enzymes: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This study investigates the hydrolysis of cane sugar by dilute acids and compares
  it to enzyme action. The results show that both acid and enzyme action follow a
  similar pattern, with the change initially being approximately linear and then becoming
  logarithmic. This supports the association theory of hydrolysis, where the proportion
  of hydrolyst affects the rate of the reaction.
