revised_title: 'On the Gases Obtained from the Mineral Eliasite: Addendum and Photographic
  Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the gases obtained from the mineral eliasite and discovers
  new lines in the spectrum. They suggest that the gas may be a compound or a mixture
  of gases and possibly associated with gases from cleveite and broggerite. The author
  also notes variations in the spectra from different specimens and plans to further
  investigate the spectra of all known gases, including argon.
