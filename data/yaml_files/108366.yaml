tldr: The Earl of Rosse examines various nebulae and star clusters using a three-foot
  aperture telescope, observing changes in appearance and structure. He discusses
  the limitations of the instrument and the importance of accurate micrometrical measurements
  in understanding these celestial objects. The observations support Sir John Herschel's
  classification of resolvable nebulae and provide insights into the nature of nebulae
  and clusters.
