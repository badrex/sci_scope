revised_title: The Photodynamic Effects of Light on Bacteria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Virology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of different light spectra on bacteria using
  photographic records of agar films with bacterial spores. The results show that
  bacteria are most affected by blue and violet light, with no effect in the infra-red,
  red, orange, or yellow regions. The findings suggest that naked arc light could
  be an efficient disinfecting agent in various settings.
