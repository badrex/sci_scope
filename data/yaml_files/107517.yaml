scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Dynamics
tldr: Davy investigates the combustion of explosive mixtures confined by wire-gauze
  and observes flame behavior. He concludes that the heat communicated by flame depends
  on its mass and that a current established from below upwards prevents explosions
  within cylinders. This research led to the development of safer mine lamps, which
  were successfully tested in coal mines near Newcastle.
