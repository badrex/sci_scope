revised_title: A Study of Fluid Refractions and Specific Gravities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author describes an apparatus for making experiments on the refractions
  of fluids and presents a table of specific gravities, angles of observations, and
  ratios of refractions for various fluids. The experiments reveal that a fluid's
  refractive index does not solely depend on its specific gravity, suggesting that
  other factors, such as inflammability or the texture of its components, play a role
  in the refraction process.
