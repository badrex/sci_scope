revised_title: A Comparison of Simultaneous Fluctuations of Declination at Kew and
  Stonyhurst
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The authors compare fluctuations of declination at Kew and Stonyhurst observatories
  during 1883 and 1884, analyzing the relationship between magnetic disturbances and
  secondary currents. They find that the ratio of disturbances is greater for short
  durations and that secondary currents may have a significant influence on magnetic
  fluctuations.
