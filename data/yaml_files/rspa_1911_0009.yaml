scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Functional Analysis & Differential Equations
tldr: The author presents a theorem that expands an arbitrary function as a series
  of normal functions and applies it to the case of Green's function of the equation,
  providing a formula for asymptotic behavior and discussing the convergence of the
  series.
