  of Chief Correlations in Collaterals

tldr: The author discusses the limitations of focusing solely on the number of principal
  colors recognized by the eye and suggests that other color sensations, such as white
  and purple, should be considered. Additionally, the paper explores the chief correlations
  between collaterals in a simple Mendelian population mating at random.
