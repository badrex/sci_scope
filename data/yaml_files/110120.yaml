scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's experiments demonstrate that the sun's rays possess
  magnetic properties, which can be observed in the vibrations of a magnetic needle.
  The needle comes to rest more quickly when exposed to solar rays, indicating a magnetic
  influence. The author also investigates the effects of temperature on the needle's
  magnetism and discusses its implications for previous experiments.
