revised_title: 'The Absorption of Light by Elements in the State of Vapour: Selenium,
  Tellurium, Mercury, Zinc, Cadmium, Phosphorus, Arsenic, and Antimony'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of light by various elements in their
  vapor state, including selenium, tellurium, mercury, zinc, cadmium, phosphorus,
  arsenic, and antimony. They observe changes in absorption spectra and vapor densities,
  providing insights into the molecular complexity and constitution of these elements
  at different temperatures.
