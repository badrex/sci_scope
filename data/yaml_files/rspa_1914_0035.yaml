revised_title: The Transmission of Electric Waves Around the Earth's Surface
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of electric waves around the Earth's
  surface, deriving a series representation for the magnetic force at any point on
  the surface when the oscillator is also on the surface. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of magnetic force near the surface and its implications for wireless
  communication.
