revised_title: A New Method for Determining Osmotic Pressure Using a Semi-Permeable
  Membrane
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author develops a new method to determine osmotic pressure using a semi-permeable
  membrane and hydrostatic pressure. The method involves applying pressure to a solution
  in contact with a liquid, such as ether, to determine the pressure at which the
  liquid takes up the same amount of water from the solution as it does from water
  at normal pressure. The author demonstrates this method with a sugar solution and
  ether, finding that the osmotic pressure is approximately 79 atmospheres.
