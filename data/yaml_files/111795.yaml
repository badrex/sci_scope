revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Altitude on the Burning of Shell Fuses
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace Engineering & Ballistics
tldr: The author, J. Mitchell, examines the effect of altitude on the burning time
  of fuses for artillery shells. He discovers that combustion is retarded at higher
  elevations, suggesting that the rarity of atmospheric air and its oxygen content
  may be the cause. This finding is supported by experiments conducted at different
  altitudes.
