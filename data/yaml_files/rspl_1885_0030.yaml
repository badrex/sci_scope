revised_title: Experimental Investigation of the Wave Surface of Quartz
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the form of the wave surface of quartz by measuring
  the dark rings caused by wave retardation. They find that Sarrau's theory accurately
  explains the observed wavefronts in quartz, with a slight increase in separation
  between the two sheets at various points.

- Crystal Optics
- Wave Propagation
