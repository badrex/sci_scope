revised_title: The Impact of Symmetrical Displacements on Atomic Structure Indications
  in Crystals Interposed in X-ray Path
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of symmetrical displacements on atomic structures
  in crystals when interposed in the path of X-rays. The study demonstrates that certain
  types of deformations can occur without affecting X-ray results, and discusses the
  implications for understanding crystal structures.
