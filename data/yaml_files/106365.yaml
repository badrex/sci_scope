revised_title: Determining the Optimal Point for Measuring Gravitational Attraction
  on a Hill
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Gravity
tldr: Charles Hutton investigates the optimal point on a hill for measuring gravitational
  attraction, determining that the best point is approximately one-quarter of the
  hill's altitude from the bottom. This research is important for accurately measuring
  the force of gravity in various locations.
