tldr: This article presents a preliminary report on the Comatulae collected by the
  'Challenger' expedition, focusing on the distribution and species found. The collection
  includes 111 species, mostly new, with 59 belonging to the genus Antedon and 48
  to Actinometra. The study highlights the differences in distribution and depth range
  between the two genera, with Actinometra being more limited in its geographical
  and bathymetrical range compared to Antedon.
