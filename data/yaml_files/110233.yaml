revised_title: Elliptic Polarization and Metallic Reflexions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the action of metals on light and discovers a new phenomenon
  called elliptic polarization. This phenomenon occurs when light is reflected from
  metallic surfaces and undergoes a physical change that is intermediate between completely
  polarized and unpolarized light. The author also finds that the angles of reflexion
  at which this type of light is restored to polarized light can be represented by
  the variable radius of an ellipse, hence the term 'elliptic polarization'.
