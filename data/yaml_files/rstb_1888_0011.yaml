revised_title: Investigating the Functions of the Occipital and Temporal Lobes in
  Monkeys
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the functions of the occipital and temporal lobes in
  monkeys by creating lesions and observing the resulting effects on their senses.
  They find that damage to these areas does not significantly impair taste, smell,
  or hearing, but causes visual impairment on the affected side.
