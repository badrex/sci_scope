revised_title: The Influence of Chemical Nature and Geometric Distribution on Drop
  Size
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The author investigates the factors affecting drop size, including the chemical
  nature of the liquid and the geometric distribution of the solid surface. They find
  that specific gravity and boiling point do not directly determine drop size, and
  that adhesion between the liquid and solid plays a significant role. The study also
  reveals that drop size increases with the radius of the sphere from which the drop
  falls.
