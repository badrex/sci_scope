revised_title: Investigating the Relationship between Diurnal Range of Magnet Declination,
  Horizontal Force, and Solar Spot Frequency
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetosphere & Solar Physics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnet declination,
  horizontal force, and solar spot frequency using data from the Royal Observatory,
  Greenwich, from 1841 to 1896. The study reveals a correlation between the magnetic
  and solar phenomena, strengthening the argument for a connection between the two.
