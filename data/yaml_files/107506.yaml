revised_title: Investigation of the Optical and Physical Properties of Tabasheer
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author examines the optical and physical properties of Tabasheer, a substance
  found in bamboo, and discovers its unique ability to become more transparent when
  exposed to water and more opaque when wet. Tabasheer also has a low refractive power,
  making it distinct from other known substances, and can absorb and display colors
  from various fluids.
