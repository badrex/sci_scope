revised_title: Investigating the Direction of Ionization by a-Particles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Particle Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the direction of ionization caused by a-particles and
  find that the resultant momentum of the emitted electrons is in the same direction
  as the a-particles' motion. This suggests that more electrons are emitted in the
  direction of the a-particles, providing insight into the nature of ionization.
