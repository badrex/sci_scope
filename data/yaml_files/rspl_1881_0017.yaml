  Extracts
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the amylolytic and proteolytic activity of pancreatic
  extracts, proposing a method to measure their activity based on the transformation
  of starch mucilage. The study focuses on the relationship between the quantity of
  pancreatic extract, time, and temperature in the enzymatic process.
