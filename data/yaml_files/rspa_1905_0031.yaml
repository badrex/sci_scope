revised_title: Investigating the Intensity and Direction of Gravity in India and the
  Development of a Modified Apparatus for Measuring Colour
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author examines the intensity and direction of gravity in India, analyzing
  pendulum observations and plumb-line deflections to understand the influence of
  regional attractions. Additionally, a modified apparatus for measuring colour is
  developed, allowing for more accurate determination of visual sensation curves and
  color composition.
