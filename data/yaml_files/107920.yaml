tldr: Peter Barlow discusses the development of fluid refracting telescopes, using
  sulfur carbide fluid as a substitute for flint glass, and compares their performance
  with other large instruments. He also describes his observations of various celestial
  objects, including double stars and nebulae, and highlights the advantages of fluid
  refracting telescopes in terms of focal power and lens size.
