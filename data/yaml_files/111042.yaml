revised_title: Experimental Determination of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule investigates the mechanical equivalent of heat through experiments involving
  the friction of water, mercury, and cast iron. He determines the number of units
  of work required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit,
  providing a numerical value for the mechanical equivalent of heat.
