tldr: The author examines the structure and relations of the alcyonarian coral Heliopora
  cèrulea and a species of Sarcophyton, as well as the structure of species of Millepora,
  Pocillopora, and Stylaster. The study provides insights into the anatomy and affinities
  of these corals, challenging previous classifications and theories on their relationships
  to other coral species.
