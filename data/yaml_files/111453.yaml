tldr: The author describes a method for separating and analyzing the three classes
  of hydrocarbons in the volatile portion of boghead coal distillate using bromine
  and other chemical treatments. The process involves converting naphtha into a heavy
  oil, separating propyle and benzole, and obtaining aniline and toluidine from the
  nitro-benzole.
