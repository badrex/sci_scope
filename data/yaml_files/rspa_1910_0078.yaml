revised_title: Investigating the Ratio of Mass to Weight in Radioactive Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using a pendulum to determine the ratio of mass
  to weight for radioactive substances, specifically uranium oxide and radium. They
  find that the ratio does not differ significantly from that of non-radioactive substances,
  suggesting that the weight of a radioactive substance is not affected by its potential
  energy or ethereal mass.
