revised_title: Optical Determinations of Melting Points and Transition Points at High
  Pressures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Solid State Physics
tldr: The authors describe a new method for determining melting points and transition
  points of substances at high pressures using optical and volumetric techniques.
  They discuss the historical context of previous research in this area and present
  their findings on carbon tetrabromide and α- and β-bromopropionic acids.
topics:
- High-Pressure Physics
- Melting Points
- Phase Transitions
- Optical Methods
- Volumetric Methods
