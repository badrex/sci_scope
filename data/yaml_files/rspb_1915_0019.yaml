revised_title: 'The Osmotic Balance of Skeletal Muscle: A Study on Muscle Immersion
  in Hypotonic and Hypertonic Solutions'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Biophysics
tldr: The author investigates the osmotic balance of skeletal muscles in various solutions,
  including hypotonic and hypertonic solutions, and explores the effects of oxygen
  and water vapor on muscle weight changes. The study reveals that muscle behavior
  in different solutions is influenced by factors such as mechanical disturbance,
  initial state of the muscle, and the chemical nature of the solution.
