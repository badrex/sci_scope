tldr: This article contains corrections for a previous paper on the dynamical theory
  of gases, addressing errors in equations and terminology. The corrections involve
  changes to chemical formulas, molecular theory, and gas dynamics, as well as updates
  to specific heat values and other thermodynamic properties.
