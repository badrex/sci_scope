revised_title: The Effect of Induced Currents on the Distribution of Magnetism in
  an Iron Cylinder Rotated in a Magnetic Field
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the effect of induced currents on the distribution of
  magnetism in an iron cylinder when rotated in a magnetic field. The study reveals
  that the maximum intensity of induction varies at different depths of the cylinder,
  and the center is more shielded as the frequency of rotation increases.
