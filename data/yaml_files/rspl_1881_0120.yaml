revised_title: 'On the Conservation of Solar Energy: A New Hypothesis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author proposes a theory that suggests the loss of solar energy into space
  can be partially arrested and returned to the sun, potentially explaining the maintenance
  of solar temperature despite significant energy loss. This theory is based on the
  assumption that stellar space is filled with rarefied gaseous matter, which could
  be attracted to and form planetary atmospheres, including the sun's.
