revised_title: Investigating the Role of Pure Chlorophyll in Carbon Assimilation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the role of pure chlorophyll in carbon assimilation
  and find that previous theories based on crude chlorophyll may be flawed due to
  impurities. They conclude that further research is needed to understand the photochemical
  reactions and processes within chloroplasts.
