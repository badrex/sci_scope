scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author, J. Flamsteed, provides a detailed account of the ingress and egress
  of Jupiter's satellites into and out of its shadow, as observed from the Greenwich
  Observatory in 1683. These observations are crucial for determining longitude and
  are calculated using new tables. The author also discusses the challenges of observing
  these events with telescopes of limited capabilities.
