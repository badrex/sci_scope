tldr: The authors investigate the effects of removing portions of the kidneys in cats
  and observe changes in body weight, nitrogenous metabolism, and the amount and concentration
  of urine. They conclude that the kidneys play a crucial role in controlling nitrogenous
  metabolism and maintaining overall health.
