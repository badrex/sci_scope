revised_title: Investigating the Apparent Magnitude of the Sun and Moon and its Relation
  to Horizon Distance
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author examines the apparent magnitude of the Sun and Moon, observing that
  the Moon appears larger when near the horizon than when elevated. They discuss various
  explanations, including those by Descartes, Hobbes, and Gassendus, and propose that
  the difference in perceived size is due to the angle of observation and the effect
  of the Earth's curvature on the visual field.
