revised_title: On the Law of Partial Polarization of Light by Reflexion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the law of partial polarization of
  light by reflection and challenges the prevailing notion that the reflected light
  consists of two portions, one wholly polarized and the other not changed. Brewster
  argues that every portion of the reflected beam has undergone a physical change
  due to the action of the reflecting forces, resulting in varying degrees of polarization.
