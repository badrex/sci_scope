tldr: Sir Richard Owen's study of Echidna Ramsayi fossils reveals new evidence of
  the extinct species' existence in Australia. The findings support previous conclusions
  about the species and its classification as a monotrematous mammal. The study also
  highlights the predatory Thylacoleo carnifex, a marsupial that contributed to the
  extinction of larger phytophagous and monotrematous mammals on the Australian continent.
