revised_title: Discovery of Tactile Hairs and Sensory Organs in Insects
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Entomology
tldr: The author, J. Braxton Hicks, discovers and describes previously undescribed
  sensory organs and tactile hairs in insects, including on the palpi, antennae, and
  legs. These structures are found to be abundant in nerves and are likely involved
  in sensing and touching functions. The study also highlights the importance of using
  chlorine to bleach tissues for better understanding insect structures.
