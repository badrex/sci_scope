revised_title: Observations on the Magnetic Needle and its Behavior in Cold Environments
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Captain Christopher Middleton reports his observations of a magnetic needle\'s
  inability to traverse when exposed to extreme cold, particularly in the Arctic region.
  He notes that the compass functioned normally after being warmed and suggests that
  cold temperatures may affect the needle\'s magnetic properties or increase friction,
  preventing proper navigation.
