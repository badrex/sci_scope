revised_title: 'Experiments with Rotating Liquid Films: Exploring Surface Tension
  and Film Elasticity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Surface Phenomena
tldr: The author describes an apparatus and experiments with rotating liquid films,
  observing the effects of centrifugal force, surface tension, and film elasticity.
  The experiments demonstrate the beauty and complexity of the resulting optical phenomena,
  including ring patterns, color changes, and the formation of black spots and spirals.
