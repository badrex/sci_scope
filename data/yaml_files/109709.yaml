tldr: Dr. John Brinkley, Andrew's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin,
  reports his discovery of the annual parallax of a Lyrae to Dr. Nevil Maskelyne,
  Astronomer Royal. Through 47 observations, Brinkley estimates the parallax to be
  at least 2 arcminutes, and discusses refraction with the co-latitude of the Dublin
  Observatory using different formulae.
