revised_title: 'The Potential of an Anchor Ring: Analyzing and Expanding Functions'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the potential of an anchor ring, a geometric shape,
  and develops a method to analyze and expand the functions related to it. The potential
  is found to be finite at all external points and vanishing at infinity, with the
  method having advantages over other approaches like Mr. Hicks' Toroidal Functions.
