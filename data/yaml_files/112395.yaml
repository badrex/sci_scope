  Food, Cold, and Hot Baths'

tldr: This study investigates the daily fluctuations of human body temperature in
  health, examining the effects of age, food, cold baths, and hot baths. The authors
  found that the average maximum temperature is lower in older individuals, and that
  food consumption does not cause diurnal variations. Cold baths lower both surface
  and deep body temperatures, while hot baths raise the body temperature significantly.
  The study concludes that neither cold nor hot baths affect the diurnal variation
  of body temperature.
