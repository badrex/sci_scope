revised_title: On the Contact of Curves and Their Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the contact of curves and their equations, focusing
  on the degree of contact and the conditions required for curves to have a specific
  number of consecutive points in common. The study involves the use of differential
  equations and geometric principles to determine the constants and properties of
  the curves.
