  and its Relation to Wind-Direction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This study investigates the seasonal variation of atmospheric temperature in
  the British Isles and its relation to wind direction. The authors analyze the temperature
  data from four observatories and find that a regular periodic effect exists, with
  maxima at the end of January and July and minima in April and October. They also
  discover that this effect is present in sea temperatures and barometric differences
  between stations.
