revised_title: 'Electrolytic Conduction and Molecular Composition: A Study of Residual
  Affinity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between electrolytic conduction, molecular
  composition, and chemical change, proposing a new theory of'residual affinity' to
  explain the behavior of electrolytes and their conductivity.
topics:
- Electrolytic Conduction
- Molecular Composition
- Valency
- Chemical Change
- Residual Affinity
