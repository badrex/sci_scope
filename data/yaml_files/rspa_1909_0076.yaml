revised_title: 'Spontaneous Luminosity of Uranium Minerals: A Fluorescent Phenomenon'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the spontaneous luminosity of a uranium mineral, autunite,
  and discovers that it exhibits a similar effect to the fluorescence observed in
  artificially prepared uranium salts. This luminosity is independent of previous
  exposure to light and is connected to the loss of water of crystallization in the
  mineral.
