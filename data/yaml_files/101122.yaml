revised_title: Observations on the Burning Concave of Lions and Metallic Salt
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: Francesco Lana observes that the burning concave of lions melts iron faster
  than gold or silver, and he speculates on the reasons behind this phenomenon. He
  also discovers a white salt extracted from a metallic substance that turns into
  a golden-colored liquid upon heating and re-solidifies into fine threads upon cooling.
