scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Astronomy
tldr: Monsieur Havelius observed a unique solar phenomenon in which a "Mock Sun" appeared
  beneath a cloud, perpendicular to the true Sun, and with a distinct red color. This
  event was followed by an intense and bitter frost that lasted until March 25th,
  leading Havelius to question if the phenomenon had any influence on the extreme
  cold.
