scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of carbon dioxide and nitrogen on flame extinction,
  finding that carbon dioxide has a more powerful extinctive effect than nitrogen.
  The study also reveals a uniformity in the proportions of inert gas needed to extinguish
  wick-fed flames, but not for gas-fed flames.
