revised_title: On the Extension of Fermat's Theorem to Higher Orders of Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Combinatorics
tldr: The author extends Fermat's theorem to higher orders of series with constant
  ultimate differences, demonstrating that the theorem can be applied to various figurate
  numbers and series. The paper also introduces the concept of notation-limit and
  proposes a theorem applicable to all orders of series.
