scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: G. J. s'Gravesande and J. T. Desaguliers present an experiment demonstrating
  that the product of mass and the square of velocity remains constant for a moving
  body, supporting the new hypothesis on momentum.
