revised_title: Magnetic Deflection and Phosphorogenic Properties of Molecular Trajectories
  in High Vacua
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic deflection and phosphorogenic properties
  of molecular trajectories in high vacua, discovering that the dark space surrounding
  the negative pole expands as the vacuum improves and that the molecular stream hypothesis
  accurately describes the behavior of molecules in high vacua.
