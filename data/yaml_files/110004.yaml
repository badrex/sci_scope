revised_title: 'Anomalous Magnetic Action of Hot Iron: Experiments and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the magnetic properties of hot iron between white
  and blood-red heat. He discovers an anomalous magnetic action where the iron attracts
  the needle in the opposite direction at a specific temperature range. Further experiments
  reveal that the height or depth of the iron bar from the compass influences the
  magnetic attraction at a red heat.
