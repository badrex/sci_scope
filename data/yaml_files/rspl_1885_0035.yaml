scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Nutrition
tldr: The study investigates the effect of physical labor on nitrogen discharge in
  the body. The results show that labor increases nitrogen output, which is not compensated
  by subsequent intake, suggesting that the increase is from stored nitrogenous material.
