revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Potassium, Rubidium, and Cesium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Atomic Structure
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of potassium, rubidium, and cesium, and
  find a close connection between the spectra and atomic masses. They determine the
  limits of the subordinate series and provide a formula for calculating the series
  with considerable accuracy.
