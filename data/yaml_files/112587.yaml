scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Tectonics
tldr: The author investigates the possibility of geological causes for changes in
  the position of the Earth's crust axis, suggesting that disturbances in the equilibrium
  of the Earth's solid crust could lead to changes in the axis of rotation, affecting
  climate and mountain formation.
