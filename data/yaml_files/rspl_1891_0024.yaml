revised_title: On the Collision of Elastic Bodies and the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the collision of elastic bodies and its effect on the
  Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The study demonstrates that the distribution of
  velocities remains unchanged after collisions, confirming the validity of the distribution
  in the context of elastic interactions.
