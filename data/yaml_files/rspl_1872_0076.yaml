revised_title: Dynamics of a Rigid Body and the Theory of Screws
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Mechanics
tldr: The authors explore the dynamics of a rigid body using the theory of screws,
  discussing concepts such as virtual coefficients, coreciprocal screws, and the sexiant
  function. They also examine the relationship between impulsive wrenches, instantaneous
  screws, and kinetic energy, and apply these principles to cases of two and three
  degrees of freedom.
topics:
- Mechanics
- Screws and Wrenches
- Kinematics
- Energy
- Coreciprocal Screws
