scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Pathology
tldr: The author presents a new hypothesis for the production of intermitting fevers,
  suggesting that the cortical part of the brain is the primary site of the febrile
  ferment. The hypothesis is based on the idea that an incongruous matter, admitted
  into the roots of the nerves in the cortex, is propelled into the medullary and
  then into the tracts of the nerves and fibers of the whole body, eventually causing
  the symptoms of fever.
