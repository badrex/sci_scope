revised_title: 'Magnetization Effects on Iron Rings: Dimensions and Volume Changes'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetization on the dimensions and volume
  of iron rings, discovering that both annealed and hardened rings experience changes
  in width and volume when exposed to magnetizing forces. The results provide insight
  into the behavior of iron under magnetic conditions and contribute to the understanding
  of magnetic properties.
