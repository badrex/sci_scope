revised_title: Experiments on the Value of the Ohm and the Development of a Deep Sea
  Electrical Thermometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Measurements
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine the value of the ohm using modified
  methods of Kirchhoff and Rowland. They also develop a deep sea electrical thermometer,
  which can be used in situations where a mercury thermometer is not available.
