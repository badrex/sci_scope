revised_title: Improvement of the Wired Micrometer Telescope with a Concave Achromatic
  Lens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Telescope Engineering
tldr: George Dollond describes the application of a concave achromatic lens to the
  wired micrometer telescope, which increases magnifying power without increasing
  the diameter of micrometer wires. This improvement enhances the telescope's performance
  in observing minute double stars and measuring distances of delicate objects.
