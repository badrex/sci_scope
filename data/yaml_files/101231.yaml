revised_title: The Role of Lungs in Animal Respiration and Circulation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: Mr. Hook's experiments demonstrate that the motion of the lungs is not necessary
  for life, as animals can survive with their lungs still. The key to life lies in
  the supply of fresh air, which aids in the circulation of blood and respiration.
