scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Oceanography
tldr: John Canton conducts experiments to determine the compressibility of water and
  finds that it expands by 1 part in 10,870 under twice the weight of the atmosphere.
  He also refutes the famous Florentine experiment, which was previously used as evidence
  for water's incompressibility.
