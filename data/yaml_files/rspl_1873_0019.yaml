scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Stratigraphy
tldr: The author compares the value of different geological ages and formations in
  terms of geological time, using methods such as lithological, stratigraphical, and
  paleontological analysis. The study reveals that the time taken for the deposition
  of certain formations, such as the Old Red Sandstone, may be comparable to the time
  taken for the deposition of other formations, like the Jurassic and Cretaceous series.
