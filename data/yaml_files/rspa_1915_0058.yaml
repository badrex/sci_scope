revised_title: On the Frictional Resistance of Elongated Bodies in Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of the form of the transverse section on
  the frictional resistance of elongated bodies moving parallel to their length through
  fluids. The study focuses on the resistance offered by elliptical cylinders in a
  confocal elliptic tube, comparing it to the resistance of a circular cylinder in
  a circular tube.
