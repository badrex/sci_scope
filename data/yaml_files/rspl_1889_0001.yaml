revised_title: Effect of Conductors on the Rate of Propagation of Electrical Disturbances
  Along a Wire
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of conductors on the rate of propagation
  of electrical disturbances along a wire, using Maxwell's theory. They find that
  the rate of propagation is influenced by the capacity of the wire and the surrounding
  dielectric, and that the velocity of propagation does not depend on the specific
  resistance of the wire.
