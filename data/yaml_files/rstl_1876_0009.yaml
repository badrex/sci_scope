revised_title: 'On Multiple Contact of Surfaces: A Geometric Approach'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the conditions for multiple contact between surfaces,
  specifically focusing on quadrics and cubics. They develop a general theory of multiple
  contact and explore the conditions for contact at various points, providing a geometric
  approach to understanding these complex interactions.
