revised_title: The Influence of Bile on Pancreatic Starch Digestion in Pigs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: This study investigates the effect of bile on the digestion of starch using
  pig pancreas and bile. The results show that bile significantly accelerates the
  digestion of starch by pancreatic amylolytic ferment, and the presence of bile salts
  is responsible for this effect. The study also suggests that bile may increase the
  amount of sugar formed during digestion.
