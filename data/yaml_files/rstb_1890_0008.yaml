revised_title: 'Central Motor Innervation of the Larynx: An Experimental Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the central motor innervation of the larynx through
  experimental methods, focusing on the cortical representation and the effects of
  excitation. They discuss the importance of species, age, and anaesthesia on the
  results and provide a historical review of previous research on the topic.
