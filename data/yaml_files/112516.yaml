scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: This study investigates the polar magnetism and magnetic deviation in the iron-built
  ship 'Northumberland.' Observations were made at various positions, and the results
  showed that the majority of the polar magnetism was due to the subpermanent magnetism
  of the ship's mass. The 'depolarization' process attempted to reduce the magnetism
  but proved to be both imperfect and transient, causing more harm than benefit.
