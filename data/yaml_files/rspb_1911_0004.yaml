  in Rats, Guinea-pigs, and Rabbits: Periodic Variations Disclosed'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathology
tldr: The authors investigate the periodic variations in the number of Trypanosoma
  gambiense and Trypanosoma rhodesiense parasites in rats, guinea-pigs, and rabbits.
  They find that the parasites exhibit periodic increases and decreases in the peripheral
  blood, with the Rhodesian strain being more virulent. The study suggests that the
  periodicity is due to variations in host resistance and the formation of latent,
  non-flagellate forms of the parasites in the host's internal organs.
