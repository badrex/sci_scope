revised_title: Functions of Positive and Negative Type and Their Connection with the
  Theory of Integral Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The authors explore the classification of continuous symmetric functions and
  their properties, focusing on functions of positive and negative type. They establish
  connections between these functions and integral equations, proving that functions
  of positive or negative type can be expanded as series of products of normal functions.

- Integral Equations
- Symmetric Functions
- Positive and Negative Type Functions
