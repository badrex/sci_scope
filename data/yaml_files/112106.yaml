revised_title: Spectrum-Analysis of Crystalloid Substances in the Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, investigates the rapid passage of crystalloid
  substances, specifically lithium and rubidium, into the vascular and non-vascular
  textures of the body using spectrum-analysis. Guinea pigs were used as test subjects,
  and the results showed that lithium could be detected in various tissues, while
  rubidium was less detectable due to the delicacy of the spectrum-analysis for rubidium.
