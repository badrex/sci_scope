revised_title: 'Electrification of Water by Splashing and Spraying: An Investigation
  into the Connection between Electrification and Liquid Surface Area'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the connection between the electrification of water
  through splashing and spraying and the increase in the liquid's surface area. They
  find that the charge per cubic centimeter increases as the size of the drops decreases,
  and that the air surrounding the water contains a variety of ions with different
  mobilities.

- Electrification
- Spraying
- Splashing
- Liquid Surface Area
