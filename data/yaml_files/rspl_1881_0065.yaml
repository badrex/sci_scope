  Skin
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This study investigates the propagation of heat by conduction in bone, brain
  tissue, and skin using thermoelectric apparatus. The experiments reveal that bone
  is the best conductor, followed by brain tissue and then skin. The research provides
  insights into the differences in conductivity and transmission of heat through various
  thicknesses of these tissues.
topics:
- Heat conduction
- Bone conductivity
- Brain tissue conductivity
- Skin conductivity
- Thermoelectricity
