tldr: The author, Don Antonio De Ulloa, describes the Vomito Prieto, a dangerous distemper
  affecting Europeans in South America, particularly ship crews. The distemper is
  characterized by violent delirium and black vomit, and is often fatal. The author
  discusses the possible causes and contributing factors, such as climate, labor,
  and diet, and notes that those who have lived in the region for some time are less
  susceptible to the disease.
