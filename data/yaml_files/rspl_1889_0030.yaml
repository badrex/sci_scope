revised_title: 'Photographic Spectra of Uranus and Saturn: A Study of Their Spectral
  Characteristics'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors examine the photographic spectra of Uranus and Saturn, investigating
  the presence of Fraunhofer lines and determining that the spectra are due to reflected
  solar light. They also study the visible spectrum of Saturn and its rings, finding
  no evidence of any additional lines or modifications of solar light due to the planet's
  atmosphere.
