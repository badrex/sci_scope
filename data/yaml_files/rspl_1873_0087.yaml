tldr: The author investigates the role of safety-lamps and shot-firing in coal mine
  explosions, analyzing 22 significant explosions and their causes. The study suggests
  that safety-lamps may not be entirely effective in preventing explosions, and that
  shot-firing could be a contributing factor. The author proposes further research
  into the mechanisms of simultaneous explosions and the ignition of explosive mixtures.
