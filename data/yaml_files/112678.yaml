  = 0

tldr: The author demonstrates a geometric property of plane curves that fulfill the
  condition d²x² + d²y² = 0, proving that when these curves intersect at a double
  point, they do so at right angles. The paper also extends the theorem to show that
  at a multiple point, the branches make equal angles with each other.
