tldr: The author investigates the spectroscopic observations of the Sun, focusing
  on the chromosphere and prominences. They discover the presence of the third line
  of hydrogen in the spectrum and discuss the possible composition of sunspots. The
  study also explores the relationship between the chromosphere and photosphere, as
  well as the potential impact of periodical fluctuations on the formation of spots
  and the overall structure of the Sun.
