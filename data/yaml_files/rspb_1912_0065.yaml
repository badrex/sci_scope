revised_title: 'The Specific Conductivity of Oxyhemoglobin Solutions: A Clarification'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Biophysics
tldr: The author clarifies a discrepancy in the specific conductivity measurements
  of oxyhemoglobin solutions, attributing the difference to a misunderstanding in
  units and the purity of materials used. The corrected conductivity values are provided
  for two different concentrations of oxyhemoglobin solutions.
