revised_title: Investigating the Density and Compressibility of Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the weight and density of water
  under various conditions. He finds that water does not become more dense when air
  is removed, and that heat causes water to expand and decrease in density.
topics:
- Water Density
- Heat and Water
- Air and Water
- Water Compression
- Vacuum and Water
