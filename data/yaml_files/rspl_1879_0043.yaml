tldr: The authors conducted a long-term experiment on the effects of different manures
  on the mixed herbage of permanent meadow at Rothamsted. They found that the agricultural,
  botanical, and chemical results varied greatly depending on the type of manure applied,
  with significant differences in the amount and botanical composition of the produce.
  The study highlights the complexity of grassland ecosystems and the importance of
  understanding the interactions between plants, soil, and nutrients for sustainable
  agriculture.
