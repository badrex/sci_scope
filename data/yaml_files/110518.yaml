revised_title: Chemical Changes in Seeds during Germination
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes that occur in seeds during germination,
  including the production of alcohol, the role of temperature, and the influence
  of oxygen on the process. He concludes that germination is an action between olefiant
  gas and atmospheric oxygen, and that the foundation for the diverse species of plants
  is established through the decomposition and combination of elements.
