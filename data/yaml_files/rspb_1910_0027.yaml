revised_title: 'Enzymes of the Emulsin Type: A Study on Enzyme Action'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: This study investigates the enzymes of the emulsin type and their action on
  various glucosides, specifically focusing on phaseolunatin and amygdalin. The authors
  conclude that the enzyme associated with phaseolunatin is not of the a-type, but
  rather belongs to the /3-series, challenging previous findings and suggesting that
  further standardization of experimental conditions is necessary for accurate comparison
  of results.
