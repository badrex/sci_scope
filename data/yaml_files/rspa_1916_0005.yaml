revised_title: Skin Friction of High Winds on Earth's Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between wind velocity and skin friction
  on Earth's surface. They find that skin friction is proportional to the square of
  wind velocity and is similar to the friction found in laboratory experiments with
  small flat plates and pipes.
