revised_title: On the Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the absorption and radiation of heat by gases and vapors,
  using a galvanometer to measure the effects of various gases on radiant heat. The
  experiments reveal that gases such as oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen do not significantly
  absorb radiant heat, challenging existing theories on heat transfer.
