revised_title: 'The Genesis of Pleochroic Haloes: A Comprehensive Study'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of pleochroic haloes, focusing
  on the thorium and uranium families of radioactive elements. The study reveals that
  both types of haloes follow the same course of development and that radium emanation
  can explain the larger embryonic haloes found in certain granites. The author also
  discusses the methods of measuring haloes and presents a theoretical explanation
  for their formation based on the ionizing effects of alpha rays.
