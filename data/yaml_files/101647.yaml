revised_title: The Function and Adaptation of Fish Bladders
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author proposes a conjecture that fish can maintain their buoyancy by adjusting
  the air volume in their bladders, which compresses or expands based on the depth
  of water. The author also suggests further research on fish species without bladders
  and the adaptations of sea creatures living in varying depths.
