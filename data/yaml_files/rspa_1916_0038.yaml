revised_title: 'Magnetic Shielding of Large Spaces: Experimental Measurement and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic shielding of large spaces and measure the
  leakage fields in a series of experiments. They find that the leakage field is more
  significant than previously thought and can be isolated from other fields. This
  allows for the study of iron under nearly zero magnetic force.
