revised_title: 'The Threshold of Vision for Different Coloured Lights: A Study of
  Rod and Cone Sensitivity'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Systems
tldr: This study investigates the minimum intensity of different colored lights that
  can be perceived by the human eye, focusing on the role of rods and cones in vision.
  The authors found that rods are more sensitive to low illuminations, while cones
  are responsible for color perception and function better at medium to high illuminations.

- Vision Threshold
- Colour Perception
- Retinal Sensitivity
- Rod and Cone Function
- Dark Adaptation
