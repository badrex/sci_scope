revised_title: Preserving Copper Sheathing of Ships with Electrical Combinations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion Protection
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the use of electrical combinations to protect
  copper sheathing on ships from corrosion. He found that adding small amounts of
  zinc or iron to the copper significantly reduces corrosion. The author also discusses
  the electrochemical principles behind this protection and suggests potential applications
  for preserving other materials, such as brass and steel.
