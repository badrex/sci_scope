revised_title: Bilateral Degeneration in the Spinal Cord of Monkeys and its Relation
  to Unilateral Cortex Cerebri Lesion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of unilateral lesion of the cortex cerebri
  on the spinal cord of monkeys, finding that bilateral degeneration occurs in both
  lateral columns of the cord. The study suggests that the observed bilateral descent
  of fibres is a genuine bilateral descent from one hemisphere, rather than a second
  decussation occurring lower down in the cord.
