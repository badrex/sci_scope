revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Streamers in the Electric Spark
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author examines the nature of streamers in the electric spark using a rotating
  mirror and discovers that the stronger streamer emanates from the cathode in each
  case. The study also reveals oscillations in the streamers that are synchronous
  with the oscillations of the spark, providing evidence that the particles of the
  luminous vapour are charged.
