revised_title: 'On the Contact of Conics with Surfaces: A Study of Tangent Conics'

scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: This paper investigates the contact of conics with surfaces, focusing on the
  principal tangent conics. The author establishes a theorem that at every point of
  a surface, ten conics can be drawn having six-pointic contact. The study employs
  a method similar to that used in a previous paper on the sextactic points of a plane
  curve, introducing arbitrary constants to comprise a group of expressions in a single
  formula.
