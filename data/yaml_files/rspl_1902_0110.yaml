revised_title: Investigation of Electric Discharges in Gases at Low Pressures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Discharges & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the potential difference required to produce electric
  discharges in various gases at low pressures, confirming the applicability of Paschen's
  law to critical and lower pressures. They also determine the minimum spark potential
  for several gases and propose that it is a property of the atom rather than the
  molecule.
