revised_title: Artificial Formation of the Diamond
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Crystallography
tldr: The author describes their successful experiments in creating artificial diamonds
  under high pressure and temperature, using a strong closed vessel and carbon obtained
  from the experiments being as hard as natural diamond. The crystals obtained have
  octahedral forms and burn easily on platinum foil, with no residue left behind.
