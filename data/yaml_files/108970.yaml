revised_title: Anatomy of the Fovea Centralis in the Human Retina
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the fovea centralis in the human retina,
  focusing on its structure and relation to the surrounding retinal layers. The study
  uses a healthy eye excised during life and preserved in chromic acid to prevent
  distortion. The fovea centralis is found to be produced by the radial divergence
  of cone-fibres and the thinning of inner retinal layers towards the outer surface.
  The author also describes the minute structure of the retina, including the bacillary
  layer, outer granule-layer, cone-fibre plexus, inner granule-layer, and granular
  layer.
