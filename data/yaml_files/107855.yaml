revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Solar Rays on Magnetic Needles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie investigates the effect of solar rays on magnetized and
  unmagnetized steel needles, discovering that the sun's rays have a greater impact
  on a magnetized needle. The findings suggest a connection between magnetism and
  solar radiation, with potential implications for understanding the Earth's magnetic
  field.
