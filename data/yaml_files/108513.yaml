revised_title: Insect Respiration and the Effects of Decapitation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the respiratory movements of insects, particularly dragonflies,
  and observes that decapitation leads to a decrease in the frequency and force of
  these movements. The study also highlights the similarities between the nervous
  centers in insects and those in vertebrate animals.
