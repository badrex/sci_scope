tldr: The author shares a letter from Robert Tredwey, detailing the discovery of a
  large piece of ambergris on the island of Jamaica. He also discusses the opinions
  of locals about its formation, which they believe comes from a creature similar
  to bees. Additionally, Tredwey mentions the discovery of two hot springs, one with
  a sulfuric smell and the other with a salty taste, which may help treat endemic
  diseases in the area.
