tldr: S. M. Drach investigates the causes that influence the daily temperature of
  any point on Earth's surface. He introduces the term 'Thermed Establishment' to
  describe the delay of solar light effects due to atmospheric conduction and local
  circumstances. Drach explains the formation of tables and diagrams, analyzes the
  perturbing causes, and discusses the role of friction from Earth's rotation and
  electricity in temperature variations.
