tldr: Lieut. J. H. N. Hennessey's actinometrical observations in India, using instruments
  from the Royal Society, provide data on the distribution of matter in the Earth's
  crust. The observations were conducted at Dehra and Mussoorie, and the results support
  the hypothesis regarding the constitution of the Earth's crust on a large scale,
  including local variations in matter distribution.
