scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: In this series of experiments, Faraday investigates the constancy of differential
  magnecrystallic force in various media and at different temperatures. He examines
  the effects of temperature on the magnetic force of bodies and the magnecrystallic
  action of different materials, such as bismuth and calcareous spar. Faraday's experimental
  techniques involve using torsion fibers and wire suspensions to measure the force
  exerted on magnetic objects in different media.
