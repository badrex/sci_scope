tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, investigates the magnetic properties of
  solar rays and their effects on a magnetized needle. He observes that the solar
  rays have a noticeable impact on the needle's vibrations and that the intensity
  of the needle decreases with an increase in temperature. This study highlights the
  importance of considering temperature variations when measuring magnetic intensity
  using a vibrating needle.
