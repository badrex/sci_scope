revised_title: The Optical Deportment of the Atmosphere and its Relation to Putrefaction
  and Infection
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the optical properties of the atmosphere and its relation
  to putrefaction and infection. He demonstrates that the air's ability to scatter
  light and produce life are interconnected, and that the lungs filter out the particles
  responsible for putrefaction when air passes through them.
