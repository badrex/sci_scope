revised_title: Magnetic Character of Armour-Plated Ships and Compass Deviation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic properties of armour-plated ships and their
  effect on compass deviation. They find that the introduction of armour plating increases
  the deviation and that the position of the armour plating and bulkheads significantly
  affects the quadrantal deviation. The study also highlights the importance of the
  ship's orientation during construction and the need for proper placement of the
  standard compass.
