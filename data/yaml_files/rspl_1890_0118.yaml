revised_title: Investigating the Relative Passivity of Iron and Steel in Nitric Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Corrosion
tldr: The author investigates the passivity of iron and steel in cold nitric acid,
  examining the effects of chemical composition and physical structure on their passive
  state. The experiments reveal that the passivity of metals varies depending on their
  composition and structure, with some steel types being more resistant to corrosion
  than wrought iron.
