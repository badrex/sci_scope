revised_title: 'Atmospheric Lines in the Solar Spectrum: Observations and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the atmospheric lines in the solar spectrum using a
  spectroscope and compares the spectra at different times of day. The study confirms
  that additional lines appearing in the spectrum when the sun is low are due to selective
  atmospheric absorption, rather than general weakening of light.
