  Meridian Line
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Trigonometry
tldr: The author demonstrates the analogy between the Meridian Line and a scale of
  logarithmic tangents of half the complements of latitudes, providing a new method
  for computing the differences of meridional parts between any two given latitudes.
