tldr: This article discusses the hourly observations of magnetic declination made
  by Captain Rochfort Maguire and the officers of H.M.S. Plover from 1852 to 1854
  at Point Barrow, on the shores of the Polar Sea. The observations were conducted
  in a makeshift ice observatory and were later analyzed by Major-General Edward Sabine.
  The study found that magnetic disturbances followed systematic laws depending on
  the hours of solar time, and that there was a striking correspondence between the
  disturbance laws at Point Barrow and Toronto. The author also notes the high frequency
  of auroral manifestations at Point Barrow, which exceeded previous records.
