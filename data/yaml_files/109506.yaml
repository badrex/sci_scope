revised_title: Effects of Membrana Tympani Destruction on Hearing
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Otolaryngology & Audiology
tldr: The author, Astley Cooper, examines the effects of membrana tympani destruction
  on hearing. He observes that the sense of hearing is not significantly impaired
  even when the membrane is completely destroyed, suggesting that other membranes
  may compensate for its loss. The study also proposes that the primary function of
  the membrana tympani is to moderate sound impressions and adapt to different vibrations.
