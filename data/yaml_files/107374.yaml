revised_title: Experiments with a Large Voltaic Battery and the Ignition of Different
  Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author presents experiments conducted with a large voltaic battery, focusing
  on the ignition of different metals when placed in the electrical circuit. The results
  show that metals with lower conducting power, such as platinum, ignite first, while
  those with higher conducting power, like silver, do not ignite. The author also
  discusses the relationship between conducting power and the capacity for heat in
  various metals.
