revised_title: The Electromotive Properties and Physiology of the Electrical Organ
  of Torpedo Marmorata
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the electromotive properties and physiology of the electrical
  organ of Torpedo marmorata, exploring its anatomy, minute structure, and the physiological
  changes that occur upon the arrival of the excitatory nervous impulse. They discuss
  previous research and findings on the subject, including the work of Colladon, Matteucci,
  Marey, and du Bois-Reymond.
