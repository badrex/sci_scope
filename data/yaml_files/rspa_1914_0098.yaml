revised_title: 'The Ignition of Gases by Condenser Discharge Sparks: A Study of Ignition
  Stages and Gas Properties'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the ignition of various gases, such as paraffins, carbon
  monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen, using condenser discharge sparks. The
  author discovers that ignition occurs in stages, with each stage representing an
  increase in difficulty and requiring more energy. The findings suggest that the
  play of forces on an oxygen atom in the ignition process may depend on the gas's
  structure and composition.
