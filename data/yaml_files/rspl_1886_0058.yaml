revised_title: 'Family Likeness in Eye-Colour: An Analysis of Hereditary Patterns'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Genetics & Evolution
tldr: The author investigates the hereditary patterns of eye colour in families using
  data from family records and finds that the shares of hereditary contributions from
  various ancestors are alike for both stature and eye colour. The study also reveals
  that eye colours of different generations remain statistically persistent, and medium
  eye colours can be variations or blends of light and dark eye colours.
