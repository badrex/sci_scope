revised_title: 'Molecular Physics in High Vacua: Contributions to the Study of Molecular
  Rays and Their Interactions'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: This paper by William Crookes investigates the behavior of molecular rays in
  high vacua, examining their properties, interactions, and responses to electric
  and magnetic fields. Crookes discusses the deflection of molecular trajectories,
  the deflection of shadows, and the rotation of molecular streams under the influence
  of magnets, providing valuable insights into the nature of molecular physics.
