revised_title: Investigation of Optical Deception in the Appearance of Spokes of a
  Wheel
scientific_discipline: Psychology
scientific_subdiscipline: Cognitive & Perceptual Psychology
tldr: The author investigates an optical illusion that occurs when a rotating wheel
  is viewed through vertical apertures, such as a palisade or Venetian window-blind.
  The spokes of the wheel appear curved, but the cause of this illusion is explained
  through the combination of progressive and rotatory motion, and the way the eye
  perceives the separate parts of the spokes.
