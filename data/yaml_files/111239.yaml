  Applications
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author, J.J. Sylvester, investigates the conjugate relations of two rational
  integral functions and their applications, including Sturm's theorem and the Bezoutiant.
  He demonstrates various properties and methods for obtaining simplified residues
  and syzygetic multipliers, as well as exploring the potential for expanding the
  subject matter of Sturm's theorem.
