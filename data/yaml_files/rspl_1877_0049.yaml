revised_title: Investigation of Spark Length Between Spherical Surfaces in Chloride-of-Silver
  Battery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors study the spark length between two spherical surfaces in a chloride-of-silver
  battery and find that a higher voltage is needed for smaller distances between terminals.
  They also observe that the voltaic arc appears stratified under a microscope and
  discuss the origin of strata in exhausted tubes.
