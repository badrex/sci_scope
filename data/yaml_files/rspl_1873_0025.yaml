revised_title: The Division of Sound-Waves by Layers of Flame or Heated Gas
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: The author investigates the division of sound-waves by layers of flame or heated
  gas, demonstrating that the sound-wave is divided into a reflected and a transmitted
  wave. This phenomenon is analogous to the division of light by a plate of glass,
  with one portion being reflected and the other transmitted.
