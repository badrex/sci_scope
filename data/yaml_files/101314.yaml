scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a new method for grinding convex spherical lenses on a plain
  surface without the need for other dishes or concave molds. The technique involves
  using a circular motion and a frame to create the desired spherical figure. This
  method can be applied to all practical lengths of the diameter of the sphere.
