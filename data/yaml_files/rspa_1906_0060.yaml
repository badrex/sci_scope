revised_title: Electrostatic Deviation of Beta-Rays from Radio-Tellurium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: This study investigates the electrostatic deviation of beta-rays emitted by
  radio-tellurium using a specialized apparatus. The results show that the deviation
  is less than that of radium, with the main source of error being the difficulty
  in accurately setting on broad, hazy lines.
