revised_title: Investigating the Intimate Structure of Cubic Crystals with Octahedral
  Cleavage
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author examines the structure of cubic crystals with octahedral cleavage,
  focusing on the arrangement of atoms and molecular volumes. The study involves analyzing
  the arrangement of primitive octahedra and the dimensions of the constituent atoms
  in compounds like silver sulfide, leading to conclusions about the atomic structure
  and the nature of gyrohedral hemihedry.
