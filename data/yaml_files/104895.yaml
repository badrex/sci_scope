scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Optimization
tldr: The author presents a new method for solving isoperimetrical problems, which
  involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a quantity depending on a line,
  space, or body with an unknown figure. This method is more general than previous
  approaches and can be applied to a wide range of problems in natural philosophy.
