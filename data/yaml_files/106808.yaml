scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author presents two case studies of uncommon formations in the human body,
  focusing on the heart and the alimentary canal. The first case describes a reversed
  heart with unique blood vessel distribution and an unusual liver formation. The
  second case discusses a significantly enlarged and distorted alimentary canal, with
  minimal small intestines and a unique colon length. These cases demonstrate the
  variety of structures and functions that can exist within the human body and the
  potential challenges they may pose during illness or disease.
