revised_title: The Influence of Acids on the Rotatory Power of Cane Sugar, Glucose,
  and Fructose
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the effect of acids, specifically benzenesulfonic acid,
  on the rotatory power of cane sugar, glucose, and fructose. The results show that
  as the concentration of the acid increases, the rotatory power of the sugars also
  increases, suggesting that acids play a significant role in altering the optical
  properties of these sugars.
