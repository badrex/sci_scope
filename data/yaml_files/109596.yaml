scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, investigates the chemical reaction between platina
  and mercury, and their potential role in the formation of palladium. He discusses
  various experiments and processes, and provides evidence that mercury and platina
  can interact and alter each other's properties, leading to the formation of a compound
  that may appear as a simple metal.
