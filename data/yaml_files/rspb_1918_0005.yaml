scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Drug Development
tldr: The authors investigate the bactericidal properties of intravenous injections
  of diamino-acridine sulphate, finding that it enhances the bactericidal action in
  serum and is less toxic to mammalian tissues. This substance has potential for use
  in treating bacterial infections.
