  Plates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the action of certain metals and organic bodies, such
  as linseed oil and turpentine, on photographic plates. They discover that these
  substances can act on the plates even at a distance, and that the action is likely
  due to the vapor given off by these materials.
