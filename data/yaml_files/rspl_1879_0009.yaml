tldr: This paper examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnetic declination
  and horizontal force observed at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to
  1877, and the period of solar spot frequency. The author finds a remarkable similarity
  between the magnetic and solar spot variations, with the magnetic epochs following
  the sun-spot epochs on average by 0.27 of a year.
