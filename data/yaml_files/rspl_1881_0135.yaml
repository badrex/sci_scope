tldr: This paper presents formulae for sn, cn, and dn in terms of sn, expanding on
  previous work by Baehr and Cayley. The author deduces these formulae using a specific
  method and provides tables of resulting expressions. The paper highlights the importance
  of these formulae in the study of elliptic functions and their applications.
