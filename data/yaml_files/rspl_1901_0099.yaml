  of Professor Karl Pearson''s Paper on Homotyposis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: This article critiques Professor Karl Pearson's paper on the Principle of Homotyposis,
  questioning the validity of determining the average homotyposis of undifferentiated
  like parts and the significance of fraternal correlation in families. The author
  suggests that the concept of heredity can be better understood as a special case
  of the phenomenon of symmetry, and that variation may be reduced to a geometrical
  problem.
