revised_title: 'Anomalous Dispersion of Sodium Vapour: A Reevaluation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author discusses the anomalous dispersion of sodium vapor and its implications
  for solar physics. They argue that the disappearance of light between the D-lines
  in the absorption spectrum of dense sodium vapor is not solely due to strong dispersion
  and suggest that the anomalous dispersion may have influenced cases of broadening
  or reversal of absorption lines.
