revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeometry & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author, John Pond, examines the parallax of fixed stars using two ten-feet
  telescopes and micrometers. He finds that the discordance between summer and winter
  observations is not significant enough to support Dr. Brinkley's claims of annual
  parallax. Pond suggests that other factors, such as the stars' positions at the
  time of observation, may be influencing the results.
