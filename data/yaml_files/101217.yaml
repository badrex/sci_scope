scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrogeology & Geology
tldr: The author describes an experiment in which a well in Lancashire caught fire
  when a candle was placed near the water. Upon further examination, it was discovered
  that the water boiled and emitted a strong breath, suggesting the presence of bituminous
  or sulfurous fumes. The author concludes that the burning was due to the eruption
  of these fumes, which were likely caused by the nearby coal mine.
