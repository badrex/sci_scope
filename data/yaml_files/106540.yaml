scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author explores the use of trigonometric tables, specifically natural and
  logarithmic sines, tangents, and secants, in resolving affected equations. He demonstrates
  that this method is efficient and can be applied to various equations in geometry,
  astronomy, and optics.
