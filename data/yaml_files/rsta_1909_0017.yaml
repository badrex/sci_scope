scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of magnesium hydride and its flutings,
  concluding that the series of lines beginning at 5210 are due to a combination of
  hydrogen with magnesium. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the
  magnesium hydride spectrum and its relationship to sunspot spectra.
