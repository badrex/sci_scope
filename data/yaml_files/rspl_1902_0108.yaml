  Organic Matter
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The author investigates the growth and cultivation of nitroso-bacteria in the
  presence of organic matter, challenging Winogradsky's claim that the bacteria cannot
  grow in such conditions. The study demonstrates that nitroso-bacteria can grow in
  the presence of small amounts of organic matter and continue to oxidize ammonia.
