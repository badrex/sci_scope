  Mechanisms'

scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the germination process of castor-oil plant seeds, focusing
  on the role of ferments in breaking down reserve materials and the absorption mechanisms
  of the embryo. The research reveals that a ferment in the seed transforms fat into
  glycerine and ricinoleic acid, while another ferment breaks down proteins into peptone
  and asparagin. The embryo absorbs these products through dialysis, refuting previous
  theories of direct penetration of cell walls by the unchanged oil.
