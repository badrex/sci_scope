revised_title: Investigating the Electric Resistance of Platinoid Alloy
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author examines the electric resistance properties of a new alloy called
  platinoid, which is a variation of German silver with added tungsten. The alloy
  exhibits a high resistance and a small variation in resistance with temperature,
  making it suitable for use in galvanometer coils and resistance coils.
