revised_title: A New Method for Determining the Ratio of the Electromagnetic Unit
  of Electricity to the Electrostatic Unit
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors present a new method for determining the ratio of the electromagnetic
  unit of electricity to the electrostatic unit, using a condenser with two co-axial
  cylinders and a Wheatstone's bridge. They discuss the errors and corrections involved
  in the method and demonstrate its accuracy and advantages over previous methods.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Unit
- Electrostatic Unit
- Electrical Measurements
