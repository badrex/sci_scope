revised_title: 'Gaseous Combustion at High Pressures: Experimental Investigations
  and Theoretical Analysis'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This paper presents experimental investigations on gaseous combustion at high
  pressures, focusing on the behavior of mixtures of methane with less than its own
  volume of oxygen. The authors discuss the results in the light of the "hydroxylation"
  theory of hydrocarbon combustion and provide an experimental determination of the
  relative affinities of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide for oxygen in flames.
