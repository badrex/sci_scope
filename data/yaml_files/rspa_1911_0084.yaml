revised_title: 'Iron Flame Spectrum and Sun-Spot Spectra: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Stellar Spectra
tldr: The author investigates the iron flame spectrum and compares it to the spectra
  of sunspots and lower-type stars. The study reveals that the lines in the iron flame
  spectrum are weakened in sunspot and lower-type star spectra, suggesting a connection
  between temperature and spectral lines.
