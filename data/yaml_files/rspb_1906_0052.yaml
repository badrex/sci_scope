  in Linum usitatissimum'

tldr: The authors investigate the occurrence of phaseolunatin, a cyanogenetic glucoside,
  in common flax (Linum usitatissimum). They find that the amount of glucoside present
  in flax plants increases with germination, reaches a maximum at an early stage of
  growth, and then diminishes steadily, ultimately disappearing altogether.
