scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents the results of a trigonometrical survey of Great Britain
  and Ireland, discussing the figure, dimensions, and mean specific gravity of the
  Earth. The study provides accurate measurements of the Earth's diameter and ellipticity,
  as well as the mean specific gravity of the Earth, contributing to a better understanding
  of the Earth's shape and composition.
