revised_title: Investigation of Emission Velocities of Photo-Electrons
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate the emission velocities of photo-electrons from various
  surfaces, including mercury, zinc, and cadmium, prepared in vacuo. They find that
  the maximum emission velocity is approximately the same for all surfaces and conclude
  that these surfaces are free from surface films. The study also provides evidence
  that photo-electrons are emitted nearly equally in all directions.
