tldr: In this series of experiments, Faraday investigates the use of induced magneto-electric
  current as a test and measure of magnetic forces. He demonstrates the principles
  and practices necessary for this purpose, including the use of a galvanometer and
  the importance of proper connections and adjustments. Faraday also discusses the
  effects of thermo-electric currents and provides methods for measuring the comparative
  value of degrees in the instrument's scale.
