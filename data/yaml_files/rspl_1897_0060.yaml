revised_title: 'On Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes: A Statistical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Studies
tldr: The author investigates the lunar and solar periodicities of earthquakes using
  statistical analysis and concludes that tidal effects may play a role in the frequency
  of earthquakes. The study suggests that the probability of earthquakes occurring
  during specific lunar and solar phases can be predicted based on the data analyzed.
