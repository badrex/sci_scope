scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Energy
tldr: John Clayton conducts experiments on the spirit of coals and discovers a highly
  flammable gas that cannot be condensed. He also observes that the gas can ignite
  and burn in a closed container, and that it must be stored in thick bladders to
  maintain its inflammability.
