revised_title: The Influence of Steam and Pressure on the Chemical Reaction of Carbonic
  Oxide and Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author investigates the conditions of chemical change in gases, specifically
  hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and oxygen. The study focuses on the effects of steam
  and pressure on the reaction between carbonic oxide and oxygen. The results show
  that the velocity of explosion increases with increasing quantities of steam, and
  the division of oxygen is affected by changes in the shape of the vessel and initial
  pressure.
