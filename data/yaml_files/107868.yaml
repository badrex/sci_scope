revised_title: Corrections to Observations on Atmospherical Refractions at Port Bowen
  and Addenda to the Table of Magnetic Intensities
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Lieutenant Henry Foster corrects errors in his previous observations on atmospheric
  refractions at Port Bowen and provides addenda to the table of magnetic intensities.
  He also discusses the importance of preserving the thermometer used in his observations
  and suggests recomputing the table of abstracted intensities for better representation
  of the law of variation.
