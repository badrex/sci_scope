revised_title: The Manipulation of X-Ray Penetrative Values
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The author investigates how the penetrative value of X-rays can be manipulated
  through various conditions, such as vacuum level, electrical power, resistance,
  distance between cathode and anti-cathode, and cathode size. The study suggests
  that the penetrative value of X-rays is dependent on the average velocity of molecules
  and the difference of potential between them and the anti-cathode at the moment
  of impact.
