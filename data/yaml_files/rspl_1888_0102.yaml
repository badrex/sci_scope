revised_title: 'The Innervation of Pulmonary Vessels: Experimental Evidence'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The authors investigate the innervation of pulmonary vessels through experiments
  involving spinal nerve stimulation and blood pressure measurements. They find that
  the rise in pulmonary blood pressure is minimal compared to the significant increase
  in systemic blood pressure, suggesting that pulmonary vessels do not have a system
  of vaso-motor nerves.
