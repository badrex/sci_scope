revised_title: Theorems on the Attraction of Ellipsoids for Certain Laws of Force
  Other than the Inverse Square
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the potential of ellipsoids for various laws of force,
  including the inverse fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth powers of the distance. The
  study involves the use of mathematical formulas and the integration of equations
  to determine the potential at internal and external points.
