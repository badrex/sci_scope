revised_title: Comparative Photographic Capacities of Silver on Glass Mirrors with
  Different Focal Lengths
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophotography & Instrumentation
tldr: The author examines the photographic capacities of two silver on glass mirrors
  with different focal lengths, finding that mirrors with longer focal lengths produce
  better quality images and have greater light-reflecting capabilities. The study
  also highlights the challenges faced in astronomical photography, such as maintaining
  steady motion and dealing with optical distortions.
