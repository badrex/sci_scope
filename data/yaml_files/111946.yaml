revised_title: A Method for Investigating the Contact of Curves
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a method for investigating the contact of curves, particularly
  focusing on conic sections. This method can be potentially extended to curves of
  higher orders than conics, such as cubics, but the labor required for working out
  these cases is significant.

- Curves
- Contact Geometry
