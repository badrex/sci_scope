revised_title: The Sublimation of Platinum at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the volatility of metals in the platinum group using
  an electric furnace and discovers that platinum sublimates at high temperatures,
  forming crystalline deposits. The study provides insights into the potential mechanisms
  of conduction in solids and the behavior of metals under extreme heat.
