scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics
tldr: 'In a letter to Dr. Bache, Charles Babbage discusses his observations of pink
  excrescences on the sun''s disk during a solar eclipse and proposes two methods
  to study these phenomena: using an opaque disk in an equatorial telescope or taking
  daguerreotype images. He encourages others to try these methods and record the solar
  spots and their changes.'
