revised_title: Investigating Compass Deviation in Iron-Built Ships
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, investigates the problem of compass deviation
  in iron-built ships and proposes a method to correct the deviation caused by the
  ship's iron. The method involves using Barlow's plate and strategically placing
  additional iron masses to neutralize the disturbing forces on the compass.
