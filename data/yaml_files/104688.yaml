tldr: This case study describes the extirpation of an excrescence from a patient's
  womb. The patient experienced a range of symptoms, including pain, weight, and a
  foul-smelling discharge. After consultation with a surgeon, a ligature was applied,
  and the excrescence was successfully removed. The patient's recovery was slow, and
  her pre-existing condition of "fluor albus" remained a concern.
