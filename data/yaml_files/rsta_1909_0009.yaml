scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Physics & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the effect of pressure on the arc spectrum of copper,
  finding that under pressures up to 203 atmospheres, the lines broaden and are displaced
  towards the red end of the spectrum. The research also observes an increase in the
  arc's brilliance and the obliteration of some series lines within the examined region.
