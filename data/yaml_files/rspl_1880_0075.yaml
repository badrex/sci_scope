  and Nickel

tldr: The author investigates the specific resistance of soap films and their relationship
  to the liquid from which they are formed, concluding that the specific resistance
  is independent of the film's thickness. The author also develops an electro-magnetic
  induction balance to study the properties of iron, steel, and nickel, revealing
  a peculiarity in these magnetic metals that cannot be explained by their magnetic
  properties alone.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Molecular Attraction
- Iron and Steel Properties
