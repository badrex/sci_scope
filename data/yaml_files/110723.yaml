scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author examines blood corpuscles in various animals and embryos, discovering
  that the nucleus can be composed of multiple parts and that cell-like objects surround
  it. He also observes that blood corpuscles are generated through a process similar
  to that of other cells, and that the adult blood corpuscle resembles the fetal corpuscle
  in some animals.
