revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Ionic Migration in the Natural Diffusion of
  Acids and Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the natural diffusion of acids and salts, focusing on
  the migration of hydrogen ions and the reduction of iron in ferric chloride solutions.
  They provide experimental evidence of ionic migration and discuss the implications
  of their findings on the understanding of diffusion processes.
topics:
- Ionic migration
- Diffusion of electrolytes
- Acid diffusion
- Reduction of iron
- Hydrogen ions
