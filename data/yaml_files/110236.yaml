revised_title: Improvement in Lighthouse Illumination Using Lime Balls
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Lighting & Illumination Technology
tldr: Lieut. Thomas Drummond proposes an improvement in lighthouse illumination by
  replacing the Argand burner with a small lime ball ignited by oxygen and hydrogen
  combustion. This new method produces a brighter light, equivalent to 13 Argand lamps
  or 120 wax candles, and was tested and acknowledged as superior to other lights
  at the time.
