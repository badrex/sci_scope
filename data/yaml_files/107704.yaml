tldr: Edward Jenner's observations on bird migration discuss the reality of bird migration
  and the possibility of a hibernating system. He presents evidence of long flights
  and daily marauding excursions, arguing against the idea of torpor in birds. Jenner
  also notes the remarkable ability of birds to return to the same nesting spots annually,
  despite covering vast distances during migration.
