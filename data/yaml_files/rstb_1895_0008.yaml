  Reproduction and Dimorphism'

scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrates
tldr: The author investigates the life-history of foraminifera, focusing on reproduction
  and dimorphism. They observe that foraminifera have two distinct forms, megalospheric
  (with a large central chamber) and microspheric (with a small central chamber),
  which they believe represent different generations. The study provides insights
  into the reproductive processes and life-cycle of these organisms.
