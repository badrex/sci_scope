revised_title: Investigating the Effect of the Spectrum on Haloid Salts of Silver
  and Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: Captain Abney investigates the sensitivity of haloid salts of silver to the
  spectrum and discovers that the mixture of haloid salts significantly shifts the
  position of maximum effect. This research sheds light on the practical working of
  photography and molecular physics.
