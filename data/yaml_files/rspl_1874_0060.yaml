revised_title: On the Liquation of Alloys of Silver and Copper
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the separation of silver and copper in alloys and concludes
  that the separation is not solely due to the rate of heat abstraction but rather
  the inequality of heat removal from different parts of the melted mass during the
  consolidation process. This phenomenon can affect the valuation of coins and the
  accuracy of assays.
