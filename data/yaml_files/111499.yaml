tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of carbanilide and sulphocarbanilide,
  two compounds derived from ammonia, and discovers that they share similarities with
  urea and sulphocyanide of ammonium in their formation. The author also examines
  the reactions and properties of cyanate and sulphocyanide of phenyl, revealing their
  chemical nature and potential applications.
