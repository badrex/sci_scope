scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: This article presents a new method for describing conic sections, focusing on
  the properties of curves generated by the motion of lines on a plane. The author,
  William Jones, uses algebraic and fluxional methods to deduce the essential properties
  of these curves, with the aim of creating a comprehensive system for understanding
  and analyzing conic sections.
