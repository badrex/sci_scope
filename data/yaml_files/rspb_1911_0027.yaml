tldr: This study investigates the genetic and morphological characteristics of various
  Indian cotton types, focusing on color, leaf factor, branching patterns, and the
  presence of glands. The author discovers that these traits follow Mendelian inheritance
  patterns and can be used to classify and improve cotton varieties for commercial
  success in the United Provinces of India.
