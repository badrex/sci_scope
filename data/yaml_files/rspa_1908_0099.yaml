revised_title: 'On the Osmotic Pressures of Aqueous Solutions of Calcium Ferrocyanide:
  Part I - Concentrated Solutions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the osmotic pressures of concentrated aqueous solutions
  of calcium ferrocyanide and test the accuracy of A. W. Porter's formula. They modify
  the formula to account for atmospheric pressure and find that the membrane establishes
  the full theoretical osmotic pressures, verifying thermodynamic relations at high
  pressures.

- Osmotic Pressure
- Aqueous Solutions
- Calcium Ferrocyanide
