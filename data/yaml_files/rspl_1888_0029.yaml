revised_title: The Effect of Finely Divided Particles on the Evolution of Gases from
  Homogeneous Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This paper investigates the effect of finely divided particles on the evolution
  of gases from homogeneous liquids. The authors observe that the addition of these
  particles increases the rate of gas evolution and discuss the phenomenon of initial
  acceleration. They also study the effect of temperature and pressure on the evolution
  of gases in various chemical reactions.
topics:
- Chemical Kinetics
- Gas Evolution
- Decomposition of Gases
- Temperature Effects
- Pressure Effects
