revised_title: 'On the Gyroscope: Theoretical Analysis and Motion'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the gyroscope's motion using strict mechanical principles
  and establishes three theorems. The theorems cover the curves described by the gyroscope's
  axis, the motion of the axis when the outer ring is fixed, and the axis' position
  when constrained in a plane or free to move.
