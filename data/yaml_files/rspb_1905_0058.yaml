revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Galvanotropic Irritability in Roots
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the nature of galvanotropic irritability in roots, concluding
  that the observed curvatures are due to chemotropic stimulation by the products
  of electrolysis, with acid being more effective than alkali. The findings challenge
  the concept of true positive and negative galvanotropic responses in roots.
