revised_title: Experiments and Observations on the Wear of Gold Alloys in Coins
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: Charles Hatchett investigates the effects of different alloys and specific gravity
  on gold coins' wear resistance and durability. He concludes that a moderate degree
  of ductility, achieved with a standard proportion of silver and copper, is best
  suited for coinage.
