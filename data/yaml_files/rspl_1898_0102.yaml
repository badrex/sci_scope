revised_title: On the Electro-Capillary Phenomena and Potential Differences between
  Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the nature of electro-capillary phenomena and their
  relation to potential differences between solutions. They examine the Lippmann-Helmholtz
  theory and propose a hypothesis that the potential difference between equally concentrated
  solutions of potassium chloride and iodide is negligible. The study provides a method
  for finding potential differences between equally concentrated solutions and could
  be extended to cases of different concentrations.
