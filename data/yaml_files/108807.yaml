revised_title: 'On the Differential Equations of Dynamics: A New Approach to Solving
  Simultaneous Partial Differential Equations'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author presents a new method for solving simultaneous partial differential
  equations, combining elements of Jacobi's methods and his own previously published
  work. This new approach allows for the solution of complex dynamical equations and
  offers a more efficient way to find common integrals of the given system.
