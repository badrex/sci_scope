revised_title: Exploring the Appearance of Colors in Rainbows and Reflections
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the appearance of colors in rainbows and reflections,
  proposing that the diverse colors observed can be explained by the refraction and
  reflection of light through raindrops. The study also presents two propositions
  related to refracting circles and the angles of incidence and refraction.
