scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This article delves into the theories of covariants of binary quantics, specifically
  quadrics, cubics, and quartics. It explores the relationships between quadrics,
  their discriminants, and the determination of their linear factors. The article
  also discusses the concepts of harmonic relation, involution, and syzygetic relations
  between three quadrics.

- Algebraic Geometry
- Covariants
- Binary Quantics
- Quadrics
- Cubic and Quartic Equations
