tldr: The author presents observations and drawings of the Great Nebula in Orion made
  between 1848 and 1867 using telescopes at Birr Castle. The study reveals changes
  in the nebula's form and brightness, as well as the variability of some stars within
  the nebula. The findings suggest that the nebula may be undergoing transformations
