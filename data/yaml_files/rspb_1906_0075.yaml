scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between liver cells, blood vessels,
  and lymphatics by injecting carmine gelatine into the blood vessels and large lymphatics
  of various animals. Their findings challenge the accepted views on the connections
  between blood vessels and liver cells, revealing new insights into the liver's anatomical
  structure.
