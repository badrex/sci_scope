scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Design
tldr: James Ferguson invents a new and safe crane with four different powers to prevent
  accidents and improve efficiency in lifting heavy weights. The crane features a
  horizontal wheel with an upright axle, three trundles with different numbers of
  staves, and a winch for turning the trundles. The design allows for different power
  levels depending on the weight being lifted, ensuring a safer and more efficient
  lifting experience.
