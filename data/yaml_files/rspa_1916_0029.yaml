scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the production of active nitrogen through electric discharges,
  focusing on the steady discharge from a direct current dynamo machine. The study
  compares the yield of active nitrogen in different regions of the discharge, such
  as the Crookes dark space, negative glow, Faraday dark space, and positive column.
  The results indicate that the yield is greatest near the cathode and decreases in
  the negative glow and Faraday dark space, before increasing again in the positive
  column.
