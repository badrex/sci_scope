revised_title: On the Voltaic Circles and Electromotors from Acid and Alkaline Fluids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the voltaic circles produced by the mutual neutralization
  of acid and alkaline fluids and explore various related forms of electromotors.
  They find a striking resemblance between the groups of lines in the spectrum of
  water and certain parts of the water spectrum, with some lines closely matching
  Dr. Grinwald's predictions.
