scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author examines blood corpuscles in various states of alteration and observes
  their division into globules. This process appears to occur within living organisms,
  suggesting that blood corpuscles may undergo a spontaneous subdivision into smaller
  vesicles.
