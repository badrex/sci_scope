revised_title: The Critical Pressure for India-Rubber Tubes and Balloons
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the instability of india-rubber tubes and balloons when
  distended by fluid pressure. They find a critical value of the radius at which the
  tubes lose their cylindrical form and develop bulges. The study provides a theoretical
  framework for understanding the behavior of india-rubber tubes and balloons under
  pressure.
