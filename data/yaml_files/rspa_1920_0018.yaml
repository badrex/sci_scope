revised_title: Investigation of Alternating Current Electrolysis and its Effects on
  Platinum Electrodes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of alternating current electrolysis on platinum
  electrodes, discovering that the rate of gas evolution and electrode corrosion depend
  on the frequency of the alternating current. They also find that the thickness of
  the platinum foil affects the amount of gas evolved.
