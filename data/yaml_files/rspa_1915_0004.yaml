revised_title: 'The Diffusion of Hydrogen through Palladium: A Study of Pressure and
  Temperature Effects'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of hydrogen through palladium and finds
  that the rate of diffusion is proportional to the pressure of the gas. The rate
  curve consists of two portions, which are explained by assuming the pressure-time
  curve to consist of two exponential functions of different slopes. At pressures
  lower than 100 mm, the rate of diffusion becomes slower and is not related to any
  simple function of the pressure.
