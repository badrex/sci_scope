revised_title: 'Seleno-Aluminium Bridges: A Study of Light-Dependent Conductivity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the conductivity of seleno-aluminium bridges and discovers
  that their conductivity is dependent on the intensity and color of the light they
  are exposed to. The findings could have implications for the development of light-sensitive
  devices and materials.
