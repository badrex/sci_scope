scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Disease Treatment
tldr: The author presents a hypothesis that universal diseases, including acute fevers,
  are primarily caused by disorders in animal spirits and their interaction with extraneous
  ferments. He demonstrates the properties of these spirits and their role in the
  body's functions, and proposes treatments based on understanding the nature of the
  disease-causing ferments.
