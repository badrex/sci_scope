revised_title: On the Deflection of the Vertical by Tidal Loading of the Earth's Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the deflection of the vertical caused by tidal loading
  of the Earth's surface, considering factors such as the deformation of the Earth,
  the distribution of density, and the influence of gravity. The study provides insights
  into the effects of tidal forces on the Earth's structure and the potential impact
  on observations of lunar deflection of gravity.
