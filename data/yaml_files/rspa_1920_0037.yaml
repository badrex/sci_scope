revised_title: Investigation of Pressure on Metallic and Composite Arcs and Electron
  Emission
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the pressure experienced by the poles of metallic and
  composite arcs, including a carbon arc, and explore the role of electron emission
  in the resulting force. They find that metallic arcs, such as iron, silver, and
  copper, experience greater pressures than the carbon arc and that the pressure increases
  with current strength. The authors also discuss the nature of the particles responsible
  for the pressure, suggesting that electrons, rather than atoms, are the primary
  cause.
