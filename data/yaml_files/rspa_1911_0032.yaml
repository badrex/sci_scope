scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Equilibria
tldr: The authors investigate the solubility-product of various electrolytes and find
  that the presence of common ions affects solubility. They also study the effect
  of different solvents on solubility and discuss the implications of their findings
  for the understanding of chemical equilibria.
