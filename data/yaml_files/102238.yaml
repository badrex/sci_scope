tldr: The author, Edmund Halley, investigates the variation of the magnetic compass
  in various locations around the world, aiming to establish a general rule for calculating
  compass variations. He presents a table of observed variations and discusses patterns
  and correlations between longitude, latitude, and compass deviations.
