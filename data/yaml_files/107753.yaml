revised_title: 'Arago''s Experiments on Magnetism and Rotation: Investigating the
  Influence of Substances on a Revolving Magnet'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors, C. Babbage and J. F. W. Herschel, describe their experiments on
  the magnetism exhibited by various substances during rotation. They find that the
  rotation of a copper plate affects a magnetized needle, and that the presence of
  certain materials, such as iron, can significantly reduce the magnetic influence.
  The authors also discuss the development of magnetic properties in different metals
  and other materials.
