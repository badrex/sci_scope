revised_title: 'Physical Constants of Saturated Solutions: A Study on Osmotic Pressures
  and Solubilities'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the physical constants of saturated solutions, focusing
  on osmotic pressures and solubilities. The study aims to apply Van der Waals' equation
  to concentrated solutions and provides methods for measuring volume, pressure, and
  temperature. The research covers various salts with different solubilities and molecular
  weights, comparing isomorphous salts to understand the effects of interacting masses
  on molecular space in solutions.
topics:
- Osmotic Pressure
- Solubility
- Concentrated Solutions
- Van der Waals Equation
- Densities
