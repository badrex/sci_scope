revised_title: Investigating the Change of Form in Metals Upon Heating and Cooling
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the change of form in metals, specifically
  wrought iron, when heated and cooled by partial immersion in water. The results
  show a maximum contraction of the metal about an inch above the water-line, with
  the effect being more pronounced in wrought iron than in other metals tested, such
  as cast iron, steel, zinc, tin, and gun-metal.
