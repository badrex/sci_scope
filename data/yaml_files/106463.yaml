revised_title: An Improved Method for Measuring High Degrees of Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Ceramics
tldr: Josiah Wedgwood attempts to create a thermometer for measuring high degrees
  of heat using clay samples. He discovers that the contraction of clay due to heat
  is a more accurate measure than color changes. He proposes a method to create a
  clay thermometer that measures heat by the contraction of clay samples in a furnace.
