revised_title: Absolute Specific Resistance Measurements of Pure Electrolytic Copper
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors present a detailed study on the absolute specific resistance measurements
  of pure electrolytic copper, using advanced techniques and precise temperature control.
  They discuss the importance of accurate wire dimensions, specific gravity methods,
  and the use of a calorimeter-like apparatus to maintain consistent temperature during
  measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the electrical conductivity
  of electrolytic copper.
