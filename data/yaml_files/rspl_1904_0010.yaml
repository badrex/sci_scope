tldr: This study investigates the zoological distribution of cancer, the nature of
  mitoses in malignant new growths, and the transmissibility of cancer from one animal
  to another. The authors find that malignant new growths occur in various animals
  and that the mitotic phenomena observed in these growths are similar to those found
  in reproductive tissues. They also confirm the successful transplantation of cancer
  from one animal to another of the same species.
