  Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author investigates the forms of equipotential curves and surfaces in relation
  to electric fields and force, using mathematical equations and experiments with
  tinfoil and electrodes. The findings reveal the distribution of electric potential
  and the behavior of electric lines of force in various scenarios, including circular
  and rectangular shapes.
