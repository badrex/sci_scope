tldr: Luke Howard reports an extraordinary depression of the barometer in December
  1821, with the barometer dropping to 27.82 inches. This event was followed by a
  rare period of stable weather, with the barometer rising to 30 inches by the end
  of the month. The author also notes the unusual amount of rainfall during this period,
  with 10.10 inches recorded in two months, a quantity without precedent in the same
  space of time at London.
