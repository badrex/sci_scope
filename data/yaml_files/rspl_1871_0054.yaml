scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Alkaloids
tldr: The author investigates the formation of polymerides in codeia and morphia,
  discovering that they can form intermediate polymerides with unique chemical properties.
  The study focuses on the reaction of acids with codeia and morphia, leading to the
  identification of di- and tetracodeia as new compounds in the opium alkaloids family.
