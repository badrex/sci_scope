scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author describes a series of meteorological experiments conducted using
  balloon ascents to investigate atmospheric conditions and temperature at various
  heights. The study aimed to determine temperature and hygrometric conditions of
  the air at different elevations and analyze the air samples for further analysis.
  The findings provide valuable insights into the Earth's atmosphere and weather patterns.
