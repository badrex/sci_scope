scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author describes the observations made by Mons. Planman during the transit
  of Venus over the Sun on June 6, 1761, in Cajaneburg, Sweden. The observations were
  communicated by Peter Wargentin, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden.
  The text discusses the correction of the meridian difference between Stockholm and
  Cajaneburg and the error in Mons. Planman's observation of the interior contact
  of Venus and the Sun, which was due to his assistant's mistake in counting seconds.
