tldr: This study investigates the embryogeny of Comatula rosacea, focusing on the
  larval development and the formation of pseudembryos. The author observes the transformation
  of the larva into a Crinoid and describes the morphological and physiological relations
  of the larval zooid, proposing the term 'pseudembryo' for these independently organized
  zooids.
