revised_title: On the Non-Euclidean Geometry and the Pseudosphere
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author explores the concept of non-Euclidean geometry, specifically the
  Lobatschewskian geometry, and introduces the pseudosphere as a surface with constant
  negative curvature. He discusses the differences between the descriptive geometry
  of the pseudosphere and the imaginary spherical surface, and highlights the work
  of Beltrami in this field.
