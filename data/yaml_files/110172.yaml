revised_title: Investigations into the Composition and Phenomena of Volcanic Eruptions
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geology
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the composition and phenomena of volcanic eruptions,
  specifically at Vesuvius. He examines the chemical composition of lava and volcanic
  gases, concluding that volcanic fires are likely due to the oxidation of metals
  in subterranean cavities.
