  Limestones of Ireland

tldr: This study examines the geological position and origin of chert beds in the
  Upper Carboniferous Limestones of Ireland. The research reveals that chert beds
  are formed through the replacement of limestone by silica, due to the warm, shallow
  sea conditions and a high concentration of silica in the water. The findings suggest
  that chert beds are a pseudomorph, a rock that has been altered in form but not
  in chemical composition.
