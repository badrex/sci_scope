revised_title: Energy of Röntgen and Becquerel Rays and the Energy Required to Produce
  an Ion in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the energy required to produce ions in gases using Röntgen
  and Becquerel rays. They measure the heating effect of these rays when absorbed
  in metals and gases, and determine the energy of the radiation emitted per second
  by uranium and other radioactive substances.
topics:
- Ionization
- X-rays
- Radiation
- Gas ionization
- Radioactivity
