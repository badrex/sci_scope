revised_title: 'Spectroscopic Observations of the Sun: New Findings and Theories'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author presents new observations and findings on the sun's chromosphere
  and atmosphere, including the detection of magnesium and iron in various solar latitudes,
  the F bright line's behavior, and the continuous widening of the sodium line in
  a spot spectrum. These observations support the theory that the chromosphere and
  photosphere form the true atmosphere of the sun.
