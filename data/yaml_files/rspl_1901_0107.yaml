revised_title: Investigation of Spontaneous Ionization in Various Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the spontaneous ionization of various gases, including
  air, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and chloroform, and finds that ionization is
  proportional to gas density. The results show a similarity to those obtained when
  gases are exposed to Becquerel rays.
