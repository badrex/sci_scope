revised_title: Experiments on the Effect of Various Substances in Lowering the Point
  of Congelation in Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Solution Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effect of various substances, such as salt and nitre,
  on the freezing point of water. The experiments show that salt lowers the freezing
  point in a simple ratio, while nitre's effect is more complex, with the freezing
  point increasing as the solution is cooled further.
topics:
- Freezing point depression
- Salt solutions
- Nitre solutions
- Crystallization
- Solution properties
