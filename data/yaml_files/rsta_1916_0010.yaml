revised_title: On the Distribution of Intensity in Broadened Spectrum Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of intensity in broadened spectrum
  lines and explore the role of electric fields in the broadening process. They develop
  a method to measure the intensity distribution and discuss the implications of their
  findings on the nature of the broadening and the factors controlling it.
