revised_title: Practical Applications of Interference Bands in Spectroscopy
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, G.G. Stokes, discusses the practical applications of interference
  bands in spectroscopy, particularly for determining refractive indices, dispersion,
  and changes in light velocity. He also explains the appearance of certain bands
  in the secondary spectrum formed by two prisms and their relation to diffraction
  bands.
