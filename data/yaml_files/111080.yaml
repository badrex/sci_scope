  of Vegetables
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the oils produced by the action of sulfuric acid on
  various plant materials, discovering that different plants yield different oils,
  such as furfurol and fucusol. These oils share similarities but are not identical,
  suggesting that the'matiere incrustante' within plants may vary between different
  plant types.
