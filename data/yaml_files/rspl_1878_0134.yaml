revised_title: Experimental Researches on Thermal Transpiration and the Extension
  of the Dynamical Theory of Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: This article presents experimental research on thermal transpiration of gases
  through porous plates and extends the dynamical theory of gases to include stresses
  caused by varying gas conditions. The author demonstrates the importance of the
  mean free path and the nature of impacts between molecules in understanding gas
  behavior.
