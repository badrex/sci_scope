tldr: The author, Robert Hooke, presents an improved barometer design that allows
  for greater precision in measuring atmospheric pressure. The new design uses two
  columns of different liquids, separated by a cane, to expand the range of the barometer's
  divisions. This invention offers a more accurate way to detect subtle changes in
  atmospheric pressure, which could be useful in meteorology.
