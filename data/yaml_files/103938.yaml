revised_title: 'Crystallization of Sassafras Oil: A New Instance of Metamorphosis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author describes the transformation of sassafras oil into crystalline form
  upon exposure to frost. The resulting crystals are indissoluble in water, inflammable
  in fire, and revert to their original state upon melting. This phenomenon offers
  a new instance of crystallization and may provide insights into the nature of solidity
  and fluidity.
