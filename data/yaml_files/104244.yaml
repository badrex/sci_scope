revised_title: Influence of Pendulum Clocks on Each Other's Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Timekeeping
tldr: The author, John Ellicott, observes that two pendulum clocks placed near each
  other influence each other's motion. When one clock stops, the other's motion increases,
  and vice versa. Ellicott hypothesizes that there is a mutual influence between the
  pendulums, but does not offer an explanation for the phenomenon and plans to conduct
  further experiments.
