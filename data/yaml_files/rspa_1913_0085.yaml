revised_title: 'Morphological Studies in the Benzene Series: The Crystalline Form
  of Sulphonates and their Molecular Structure'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The authors investigate the crystalline forms and molecular structures of sulphonates
  in the benzene series, focusing on the relationship between their crystalline forms
  and molecular structure. They study various salts, including dichloro-acid and its
  lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium salts, and discuss their morphotropic relationships
  and isomorphism.
topics:
- Crystallography
- Sulphonates
- Molecular Structure
- Benzene Derivatives
- Crystal Forms
