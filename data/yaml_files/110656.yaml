revised_title: Exploring the Absence of Pigment in Animal Bodies
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: James Alderson investigates the absence of colored pigment in different parts
  of animal bodies, proposing a hypothesis that it is due to the union of the epidermis
  and true skin, which excludes the rete mucosum. He supports this idea by comparing
  it to cicatrices, which are colorless due to the organization of lymph from a wound.
