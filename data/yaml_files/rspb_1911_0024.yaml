revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Local Anesthetics on Nerve Conductivity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of various local anesthetics on nerve conductivity,
  comparing the onset and duration of anaesthetic blocks using different drugs and
  concentrations. The results provide insights into the response of nerve to direct
  electrical stimulation and the factors influencing the onset and recovery of the
  anaesthetic block.
