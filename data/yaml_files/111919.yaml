revised_title: Investigating the Heat Developed at the Poles of a Voltaic Battery
  during Luminous Discharges
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author examines the heat generated at the poles of a voltaic battery during
  luminous discharges, discovering that the negative terminal becomes heated in an
  induction coil, while the positive terminal heats up in a voltaic battery. The experiments
  provide insight into the heating mechanisms of these devices and contribute to the
  understanding of their functioning.
