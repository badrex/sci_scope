revised_title: A Simplified Expression for Osmotic Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The authors derive a simplified expression for osmotic pressure, taking into
  account factors such as freezing point depression, vapor pressure lowering, and
  ionization. This new expression provides a more accurate representation of osmotic
  data in relation to progressive hydration.
