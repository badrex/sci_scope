revised_title: The Role of Lecithin in the Germination of Castor Oil Plant Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the role of lecithin in the germination of castor oil
  plant seeds. They find that lecithin plays a part in the utilization of fatty reserves
  and increases during the later stages of germination. Lecithin, a normal constituent
  of living cells, may also have a nutritive value and influence the transport of
  materials across the protoplasm.
