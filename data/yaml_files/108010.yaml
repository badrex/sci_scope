scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the reflex function of the Medulla Oblongata and Medulla
  Spinalis, distinguishing it from other modes of muscular action. This function is
  characterized by being excited in its action and reflex in its course, with impressions
  made upon certain nerves being conveyed to the medulla and reflected along other
  nerves to adjacent or remote parts of the body.
