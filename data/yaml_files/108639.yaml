scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for finding symmetric functions of the roots of
  a system of two equations, specifically linear and quadratic or linear and cubic
  equations. The process involves using the resultant of the system and leads to expressions
  for the symmetric functions of the roots.
