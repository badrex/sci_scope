revised_title: Spectral Phenomena in the Arc Produced by a Siemens' Machine
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The author investigates spectral phenomena in the arc produced by a Siemens'
  machine, observing new and complex phenomena due to the increased length of the
  arc and the introduction of substances into it. The author also discovers differences
  in the spectra of the arc's poles and the progression of lines from pole to pole,
  suggesting the influence of temperature and electricity.
