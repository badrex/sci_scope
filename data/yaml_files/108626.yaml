  Curves
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: This article delves into the study of curves of the third order, specifically
  the Pippian and Quippian curves, and their relationship to the Hessian. The author
  provides a comprehensive analysis of these curves, their properties, and their geometric
  definitions, as well as their connection to other mathematical concepts such as
  conic poles and lineo-polar envelopes.
