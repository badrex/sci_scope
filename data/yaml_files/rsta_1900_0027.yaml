  Thermometers'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geothermal Energy
tldr: This study investigates the underground temperature at Oxford in 1899 using
  five platinum-resistance thermometers. The thermometers were placed in the ground
  at various depths, and the data collected provided insights into the temperature
  gradient and heat transfer in the area. The results showed discrepancies between
  theory and observation, suggesting differences in the assumptions made in the theory
  and the actual conditions in the gravel layer.
