revised_title: The Role of Temperature and Air Expansibility in Mist Formation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Sir H. Davy explains that after sunset, the temperature drop on land is greater
  than on water due to water's expansibility at temperatures below 40Â°C. This difference
  in temperature leads to the formation of mist when cold, dry air from land mixes
  with warmer, damp air above water.
