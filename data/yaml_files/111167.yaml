revised_title: Rhythmic Contractility and Valves in Bat's Wing Veins
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, T. Wharton Jones, discovers that the veins of a bat's wing have
  rhythmic contractility and valves that help regulate blood flow. These veins contract
  and dilate rhythmically, accelerating blood flow during contractions and checking
  it during dilations. The valves prevent regurgitation of blood and work in conjunction
  with the heart to maintain blood flow.
