revised_title: Investigating the Spectroscopic Properties of Dust and its Luminosity
  in Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the spectroscopic properties of dust particles in electric
  discharges and find that they do not act like gaseous matter, becoming luminous
  with their characteristic spectrum. The rapid removal of dust particles from the
  course of the discharge suggests that extraterrestrial matter must be in a gaseous
  state or have its properties altered to become luminous in an electric discharge.
