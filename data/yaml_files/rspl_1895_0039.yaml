revised_title: The Influence of Cerebral Cortex on Larynx and Vocal Cord Movements
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: This research investigates the influence of the cerebral cortex on larynx and
  vocal cord movements in dogs and cats. The study finds that there are distinct foci
  in the cerebral cortex responsible for adduction and abduction of the vocal cords,
  as well as acceleration and intensification of their movements. The findings suggest
  that the peripheral laryngeal apparatus has a minimal influence on the effects obtained
  from the central nervous mechanism.
