revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Temperature on Ionization in Gases and
  Vapors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on ionization in gases and
  vapors, specifically focusing on Röntgen rays. They find that ionization in a gas
  is independent of temperature when the gas is kept at constant density, and that
  ionization in air remains unaffected even when cooled down to a temperature near
  its condensation point.
topics:
- Ionization
- Temperature effects
- Röntgen rays
- Gas ionization
- Vapor ionization
