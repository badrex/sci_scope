revised_title: 'Magnetic Deformation of Nickel: Temperature and Tension Effects'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: This study investigates the magnetic deformation of nickel under varying temperatures
  and tensions. The results show that temperature has a significant impact on the
  magnetic contraction, with an increase in contraction at low fields and a decrease
  at high fields. The study also reveals that the temporary contraction is more affected
  by temperature changes than the residual contraction.
