revised_title: Investigation of Electrostatic Capacity of Glass and Comparison of
  Experimental Methods
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: Dr. Hopkinson investigates the electrostatic capacity of glass and compares
  different experimental methods to determine the specific inductive capacity. He
  concludes that neither of the proposed explanations for the differences in results
  can account for the observed discrepancies and suggests that the deviation from
  a uniform field in one method may be the cause of the errors.
