revised_title: The Dispersed Energy Distribution of a Light Pulse by a Prism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of a light pulse by a prism and discovers
  that the pulse separates into different colors in the focal plane of a telescope.
  The study also compares the energy distribution of the pulse with Wien's and Planck's
  laws, showing that the pulse's shape is similar to both distributions.
