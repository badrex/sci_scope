revised_title: Isomerism of Diatomic Compounds and the Formation of Poly-Ammonias
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the isomerism of diatomic compounds, specifically poly-ammonias,
  and their reactions with oxalate ethers. The study reveals differences in properties
  and transformations between isomers, and the formation of new organic bases containing
  both ethylene and oxalyl groups.
