tldr: The author presents a detailed study of the variation and dip of the magnetic
  needle at the Royal Society between 1786 and 1805. The study includes observations
  made at various times of the day and year, and the results are used to determine
  the effect of the ironwork of the building on the compass. The author also compares
  the observations made indoors and outdoors to assess the influence of the ironwork
  on the needle.
