revised_title: The Solar and Lunar Diurnal Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: This article investigates the solar and lunar diurnal variations of terrestrial
  magnetism, focusing on the role of electric currents in the upper atmosphere. The
  authors use harmonic analysis to determine the origin of these variations and discuss
  the external and internal factors contributing to the magnetic field at the Earth's
  surface.
