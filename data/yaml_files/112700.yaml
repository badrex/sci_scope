revised_title: On the Relationship Between Muscle Cross-Section and Tendon Cross-Section
  in Animal Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Biomechanics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between muscle and tendon cross-sections
  and finds that the ratio of these cross-sections depends on the amount of friction
  experienced by the tendon. This relationship has implications for understanding
  animal mechanics and locomotion.
