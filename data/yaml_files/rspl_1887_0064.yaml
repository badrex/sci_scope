  and Rock Deformation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Tectonics
tldr: The author analyzes Mr. Davison's paper on mountain formation and rock deformation,
  discussing the geological implications of his findings. The paper highlights the
  relationship between the folding and cleavage of older rocks and their position
  in the Earth's crust, as well as the role of compression and tension in the formation
  of mountain chains.
