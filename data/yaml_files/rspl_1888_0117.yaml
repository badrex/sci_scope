scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: This paper by E.P. France, with an introduction by Professor Schafer, discusses
  the descending degenerations that occur in the lower portions of the central nervous
  system as a result of artificial lesions in the cerebral cortex. The research was
  conducted using monkey models and is illustrated with photographs of brain sections
  and microscopic images of spinal cord and medulla oblongata.
