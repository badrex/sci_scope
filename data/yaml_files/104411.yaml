revised_title: On the Action of Springs and the Elastic Force of the Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Elasticity
tldr: The author presents a theory on springs and their action, stating that the resistance
  of a spring is proportional to the space it is removed from its natural state. He
  also explains the difference between the elastic force of a spring and the force
  of the air, and demonstrates how the velocity of a body and the time it takes to
  bend a spring are related to the original velocity and the height of the spring.
