revised_title: Investigating the Origin of Springs and the Role of Subterranean Passages
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrogeology & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the origins of springs, challenging the idea that all springs
  come from rain, mists, and other atmospheric sources. Instead, he proposes that
  subterranean passages and communications between seas and springs supply many of
  these water sources. The author also discusses the role of these passages in causing
  changes in spring water quality and the influence of subterranean water circulation
  on the Earth's surface.
