scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the differences in the position of the ganglia of the
  ventral nerve-cord in three species of scorpions and confirms the general accuracy
  of George Newport's description of the nervous system in Androctonus funestus. The
  study reveals anatomical differences between scorpions with a triangular sternum
  and those with a pentagonal sternum.
