revised_title: Microscopic Observations and the Limits of Visibility
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the limits of visibility and resolution in microscopy
  using high-power definition techniques and mercurial particles. They discover that
  real objects as small as the millionth of an inch can be detected and that the separating
  power of a microscope can be measured by the sine of the semi-aperture.
