revised_title: 'Electrostatic Capacity of Glass and Liquids: Further Investigations'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the electrostatic capacity of glass and liquids, comparing
  previous experimental results and testing hypotheses regarding the influence of
  electromotive force and discharge time on the specific inductive capacity. The author
  concludes that the previously published values for glass capacity are accurate and
  that the discrepancies in experimental results are due to defects in the methods
  used.
