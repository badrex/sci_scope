revised_title: On the Microrheometer and the Rate of Flow of Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a modified microrheometer design and investigates the rate
  of flow of saline solutions, discovering that temperature and chemical composition
  significantly affect the flow rate. The microrheometer can be used to study the
  properties of various liquids and their interactions with salts.
