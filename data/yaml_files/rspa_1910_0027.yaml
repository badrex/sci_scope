revised_title: Investigating the Relationship Between Rainfall Rate and Charge in
  Thunderstorms
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between rainfall rate and electrical
  charge in thunderstorms, finding that positive and negative charges behave differently
  as rainfall rates increase. They also observe a tendency for the preponderance of
  positive over negative electricity to decrease as the charge per cubic centimeter
  of water increases.
