revised_title: Investigating Negative After-Images Following Brief Retinal Excitation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: The author investigates the nature of negative after-images following brief
  retinal excitation and discovers that the greenish-blue color is due to the negative
  after-image of the red, with the after-image being more conspicuous in certain cases,
  causing the red band to be overlooked.
