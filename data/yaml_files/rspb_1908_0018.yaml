revised_title: A Study of the Mechanism of Respiration and the Role of the Vertebral
  Column and Diaphragm
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: This study investigates the changes in the human trunk during respiration and
  the role of the vertebral column and diaphragm in the respiratory process. Using
  orthodiagraphic measurements, the authors found that the neck shortens and widens,
  the shoulders raise, and the spine moves in a way that aids in breathing. The study
  also highlights the importance of spinal movement in the aeration of the lungs and
  the differences between the right and left halves of the diaphragm.
