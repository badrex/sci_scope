revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Filament Current on Wave-Length in Ionic
  Valves
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electronics & Oscillations
tldr: The authors study the relationship between filament current and wave-length
  in ionic valves, discovering that there is a maximum wave-length for a specific
  filament current. They also explore different methods of linking and rectifying,
  and observe that the wave-length and amplitude of oscillations decrease when certain
  changes are made to the circuit.
