scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to investigate the legend of scorpions
  committing suicide by stinging themselves. The experiments reveal that scorpions
  can physically sting themselves, but the poison is powerless to kill the same individual
  or another of the same species. The author also discovers that scorpions cannot
  withstand high temperatures and will fall into a 'heat coma' and eventually die
  if exposed to extreme heat.
