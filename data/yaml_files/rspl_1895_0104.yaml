revised_title: Investigation of Electric Convection and Convection Potentials
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of electric and magnetic forces in
  electromagnetic systems moving through the ether, introducing the concept of electric
  and magnetic convection potentials. They also explore the energy of moving electrical
  systems and the behavior of charged ellipsoids in motion.
topics:
- Electric Convection
- Magnetic Forces
- Maxwell's Theory
- Electric and Magnetic Potentials
- Heaviside Ellipsoid
