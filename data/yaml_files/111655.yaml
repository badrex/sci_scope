revised_title: Investigating the Muscular Movements Resulting from Galvanic Current
  Action on Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the muscular movements resulting from the action of a galvanic
  current on nerve, investigating the effects of different current arrangements and
  nerve configurations. The study reveals that the order of contractions is influenced
  by the presence and exclusion of a derived current, and provides insight into the
  complex subject of muscular motion and electricity.
