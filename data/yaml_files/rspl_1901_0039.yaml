revised_title: Investigating the Growth of Magnetism in Iron under Alternating Magnetic
  Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the growth of magnetism in an iron cylinder when exposed
  to alternating magnetic force. The study explores the shielding effect of induced
  currents in iron plates and the relationship between the maximum average induction
  density and the frequency of the alternating magnetic field.
