revised_title: A New Theory of Molecular Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism
tldr: Professor D. E. Hughes presents a new theory of magnetism based on experimental
  research, suggesting that each molecule of magnetic metal is a separate magnet with
  its own polarity. He also proposes that molecular polarity can be rotated by torsion,
  stress, or physical forces like magnetism and electricity, and that inherent polarity
  is a constant quantity like gravity.
