revised_title: Investigating the Deviation of Magnetized Needles towards Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie investigates the deviation of magnetized needles towards
  iron, challenging the hypothesis that the iron's magnetic power is induced from
  the earth. He also examines the influence of needle length on the extent of deviations
  and proposes equations for calculating deviations in various scenarios.
