revised_title: Investigating the 'Blaze Currents' of the Frog's Eyeball
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author examines the 'blaze currents' of the frog's eyeball, discovering
  that the retina plays a significant role in the electrical response to both light
  and electrical stimulation. The study also reveals that other tissues within the
  eyeball contribute to the electrical response, suggesting that blaze currents may
  occur in other living tissues as well.
