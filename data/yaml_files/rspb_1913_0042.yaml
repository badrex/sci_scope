scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author investigates the development and classification of protostigmata
  in various ascidian species, confirming previous observations and proposing a new
  interpretation of the process of stigmatogenesis. The study supports a more accurate
  classification of ascidians based on the protostigmatic condition.
