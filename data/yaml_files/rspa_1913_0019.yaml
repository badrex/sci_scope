revised_title: A New Analytical Expression for Representing Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial
  Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author presents a new analytical expression for representing the components
  of the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism, which can be used to create unsymmetrical
  curves that closely mimic the observed characteristics of magnetic elements like
  declination, west, north, and vertical components.
