revised_title: Experimental Connection of Vagus Nerve with Superior Cervical Ganglion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the connection between the vagus nerve and the superior
  cervical ganglion through experiments on cats. The results show that the vagus nerve
  fibers can form connections with the structures associated with the cervical sympathetic,
  demonstrating similarities between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic fibers.
