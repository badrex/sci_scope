tldr: This study investigates the electrical signs of secreto-motor action in a cat's
  foot after death, using the electrometer to record responses to various stimuli.
  The research explores latency, the course of a single response, the composition
  of tetanus, summation of stimuli, fatigue, and recovery, as well as the difference
  between infrequent and frequent stimuli. The findings reveal that the electrical
  effects are of glandular origin and are significantly slower than muscular responses.
