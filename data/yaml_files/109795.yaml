revised_title: A New Method for Determining a Comet's Orbit from Three Observations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author presents a new method for deducing a first approximation of a comet's
  orbit using only three geocentric observations. The method is compared to existing
  methods by Laplace and Legendre, and is found to be at least as accurate and more
  practical for general use.
