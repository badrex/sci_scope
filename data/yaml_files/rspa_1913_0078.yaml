revised_title: On the Polarization of Light Passing through Narrow Slits
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the polarization of light passing through narrow slits
  and finds that unpolarized light appears polarized after passing through a narrow
  slit, depending on the orientation of the slit and the electric vector of the light.
topics:
- Polarization
- Optics
- Wave Propagation
- Boundary Conditions
- Thin Films
