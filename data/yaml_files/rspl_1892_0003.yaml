revised_title: Anatomical and Functional Investigation of the Brachial Plexus in Dogs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Anatomy
tldr: The authors investigate the nerve roots and their functions in the brachial
  plexus of dogs through stimulation, ablation, and regeneration experiments. They
  find that each nerve root controls a group of muscles with coordinated movements
  and that individual muscle fibers are innervated by multiple nerve roots. The study
  also reveals that the Wallerian law of degeneration may be erroneous in certain
  cases.
