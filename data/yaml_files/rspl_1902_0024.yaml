revised_title: Coefficients of Cubical Expansion of Ice, Hydrated Salts, Solid Carbonic
  Acid, and Other Substances at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the coefficients of cubical expansion of ice, hydrated
  salts, solid carbonic acid, and other substances at low temperatures. The author
  determines the densities of these substances at the boiling point of oxygen and
  calculates their mean coefficients of expansion between that temperature and ordinary
  temperatures. The research opens up a large field of investigation with potential
  for valuable deductions.
topics:
- Cubical Expansion
- Low Temperatures
- Hydrated Salts
- Solid Carbonic Acid
