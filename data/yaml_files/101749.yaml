revised_title: Investigating the Surface Figures of Contiguous Fluids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: In this article, Robert Boyle explores the surface figures of contiguous fluids,
  particularly liquids, and their physical properties. He conducts experiments to
  observe the effects of different liquids and their interactions with one another
  and with solid bodies. His findings contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics
  and surface tension.
