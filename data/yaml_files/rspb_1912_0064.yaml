revised_title: Further Observations on the Variability of Streptococci in Relation
  to Certain Fermentation Tests and Their Possible Meaning
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the variability of streptococci in relation to fermentation
  tests and finds that the reactions of these bacteria can change over time and under
  different conditions, questioning the reliability of these tests for differentiating
  streptococci types.
topics:
- Streptococci
- Fermentation tests
- Bacterial variability
- Microbial culturing
