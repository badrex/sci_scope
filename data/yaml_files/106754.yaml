revised_title: The Role of Attractive Force in Combustion and the Emission of Light
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the role of attractive force in combustion and the emission
  of light. Through a series of experiments, he demonstrates that the color of a flame
  is regulated by the decrease of attractive force and that different colors of light
  escape from combustibles at varying degrees of heat.
