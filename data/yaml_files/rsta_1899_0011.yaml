revised_title: Investigating the Electrical Conductivity of Flames Containing Salt
  Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity of flames containing salt
  vapours and explore the relationship between current and potential difference. They
  also study the ionization of salt vapour and the velocities of ions in the flame
  and hot air. The findings contribute to the understanding of the conductivity of
  salt vapours and their similarities to Rontgenised gases.
