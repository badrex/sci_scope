revised_title: 'Cyanides of Oxy-Radicals in Di- and Tri-Atomic Alcohols: Acid Formation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the formation of cyanides from oxy-radicals of di- and
  tri-atomic alcohols and their subsequent reaction with potash to form new acids.
  The study focuses on the acid formation in the glycerine series, with a specific
  example of a new acid, C10H16O2Cy, and its ether derivative.
