revised_title: Contractility of Protoplasm in Plant Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the contractility of protoplasm in plant cells, particularly
  in the tentacle cells of Prosera and the pulvinus of Mimosa pudica. They observe
  that certain changes in the cells lead to increased impenetrability, suggesting
  a mechanism of contractility. The author concludes that plant cell protoplasm, like
  animal cell protoplasm, is capable of active contraction.
