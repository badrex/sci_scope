scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author presents an analytical approach to the theory of conic sections,
  focusing on the decomposition of ternary quadrics and the establishment of formulae
  for various geometric questions related to conics. The study involves the transformation
  of given quadric functions and the use of inverse coefficients to determine the
  characteristics of conic equations.
