revised_title: Investigating the Connection Between Solar Spotted Area, Terrestrial
  Meteorology, and Terrestrial Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate Science
tldr: The author examines the potential connection between solar spotted area, terrestrial
  meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism, suggesting that variations in the former
  may precede changes in the latter two. This could have implications for predicting
  meteorological changes in the future.
