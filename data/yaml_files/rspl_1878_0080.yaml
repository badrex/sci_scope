revised_title: Acceleration of Oxidation by the Least Refrangible End of the Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: Captain Abney's experiments reveal that the least refrangible end of the spectrum
  accelerates oxidation, and this action is responsible for the formation of compounds
  that cannot be developed. The study also confirms that natural color photography
  depends on the same action.
