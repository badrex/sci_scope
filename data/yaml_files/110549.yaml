revised_title: On the Connection between the Phenomena of Light Absorption and Thin
  Plate Colors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Sir David Brewster, examines the connection between the phenomena
  of light absorption and the colors of thin plates. He observes that the spectrum
  is crossed with dark and colored bands, which change with the plate's inclination.
  Brewster compares these phenomena with absorption in solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies,
  finding a common factor in the divided or mutilated spectrum. He identifies a new
  property of light, where the reflecting force selects specific colored rays, explaining
  dichroism in doubly refracting bodies.
