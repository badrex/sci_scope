revised_title: Properties of Tangents and Trapeziums in Circles
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a series of propositions containing properties of tangents
  to circles and trapeziums inscribed and non-inscribed in circles. The study also
  includes propositions on the elliptic representations of circles in perspective.
  The research aims to provide a foundation for further improvement in the science
  of perspective and contribute to the understanding of geometric figures, such as
  circles.
