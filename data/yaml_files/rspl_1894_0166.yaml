revised_title: The Significance of Variation in Organic Evolution
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author discusses the importance of variation in organic evolution and the
  role of small variations in the survival and reproduction of species. The study
  focuses on the variation in two dimensions of female Carcinus moenas and examines
  the effect of these variations on the chance of survival and reproduction, without
  relying on theories of functional adaptation or heredity mechanisms.
