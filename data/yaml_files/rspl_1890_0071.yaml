revised_title: On the Rate of Propagation and Direction of the Luminous Discharge
  of Electricity through a Rarefied Gas
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the rate of propagation and direction of the luminous
  discharge of electricity through a rarefied gas, using a long glass tube and a rotating
  mirror. The experiments reveal that the luminosity does not consist of a wind of
  luminous particles traveling with the velocity of the discharge, and that the main
  discharge starts from the anode.
