revised_title: Determination of the Rigidity of Glass through Flexural and Torsional
  Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author conducts experiments on a glass rod to determine its flexural and
  torsional rigidity, using a unique apparatus and precise measurements. The results
  show that the rigidity of glass is directly proportional to its sectional area and
  inversely proportional to its length.

- Glass Rigidity
- Flexural Rigidity
- Torsional Rigidity
