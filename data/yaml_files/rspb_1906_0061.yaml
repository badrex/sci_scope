  on Transmission and Trypanosome Types'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between Glossina palpalis and Trypanosoma
  gambiense, the trypanosome responsible for sleeping sickness. They describe their
  observations and experiments on the transmission of the parasite through tsetse-flies
  and identify two distinct types of trypanosomes. The study provides insights into
  the biology and infection mechanisms of the disease vector and the trypanosome itself.
