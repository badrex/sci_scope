revised_title: The Effect of the Magnet on the Scattering of Beta and Alpha Particles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Subatomic Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of magnetic fields on the scattering of alpha
  and beta particles, demonstrating that molecular magnetic fields discovered by Weiss
  are efficient agents in the scattering process. The study considers charged particles
  moving in the equatorial plane of a fixed magnetic doublet and provides a rough
  estimate of the effect's magnitude.
