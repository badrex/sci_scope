revised_title: An Investigation of the Causes of Variation in Optical Rotatory Power
  and Anomalous Rotatory Dispersive Power of Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors study the causes of variation in optical rotatory power and anomalous
  rotatory dispersive power of organic compounds in solutions. They investigate the
  effects of temperature, concentration, and solvents on the rotatory power of substances
  like fructose, methylic tartrate, and ethylic tartrate, and propose a method to
  determine the composition of these mixtures using a characteristic diagram.
