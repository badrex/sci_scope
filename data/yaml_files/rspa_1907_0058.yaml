revised_title: 'On Light Elliptically Polarized by Reflexion: A Comparison with Theory'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the phenomenon of light elliptically polarized by reflection,
  particularly near the polarizing angle, and compare their findings with existing
  theory. They analyze the displacement of the medium and its curl in the case of
  reflection from an isotropic transparent substance, providing a detailed explanation
  of the elliptic orbit and its elements.
