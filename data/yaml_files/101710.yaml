scientific_subdiscipline: Food Chemistry & Preservation
tldr: The author documents two instances of meat, specifically veal and pork, exhibiting
  unusual shining properties. The veal shone brightly even after being cooked and
  eaten, while the pork's gut and feet emitted light when submerged in a pickle solution.
  The author also notes the effects of the shining substance on human hands and speculates
