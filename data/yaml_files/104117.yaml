revised_title: 'Friction of Pullies: Experiments and Their Implications'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the friction of pulleys and finds that the
  additional force required to overcome friction in real-world tackle systems is higher
  than expected based on mechanical principles alone. This is due to the increased
  friction caused by the rope's contact with the cheeks holding the sheevers.
