tldr: The author investigates the early development of Cirripedia, focusing on the
  embryonic stages and larval evolution. The study reveals a uniform development process
  across different species, with notable differences in the adult forms. The research
  also highlights the importance of the nauplius stage and the similarities in development
  between Balanus and Lepas.
