revised_title: A New Approach to Optical Aberration Analysis
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author develops a new method to analyze optical aberration, expanding Gauss's
  method to include third-order aberrations. This new approach allows for more efficient
  calculations of telescopic objectives, offering a significant reduction in the required
  numerical work.
topics:
- Optical Aberration
- Gauss's Method
- Abbe's Sine Condition
- Petzval's Expression
- Telescopic Objectives
