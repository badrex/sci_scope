scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geothermal Studies
tldr: The author analyzes temperature observations made during the construction of
  the Alpine tunnel and concludes that the Earth's interior temperature increases
  at a rate less than previously estimated. The study also suggests that the true
  maximum temperature of the rock is around 84Â°F.
