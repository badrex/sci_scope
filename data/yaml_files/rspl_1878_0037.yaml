revised_title: The Role of Vessel Sides in Maintaining Supersaturation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the role of the sides of a vessel in maintaining the
  state of supersaturation in saline solutions. Experiments show that adhesion of
  the solution to the walls of the vessel is crucial for maintaining supersaturation,
  and rubbing the interior surface can cause the solution to break down.
