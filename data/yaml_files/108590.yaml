scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author analyzes the effects of larger magnetic disturbances on horizontal
  and vertical magnetic forces at Toronto over five years. By identifying and categorizing
  these disturbances, the study aims to uncover the periodical laws that govern their
  occurrence and provide insights into the Earth's magnetism.
