revised_title: Observations of Ultra-Violet Spectrum of Water in Flames
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author discusses the observation of an ultra-violet spectrum of water in
  flames, which opens up questions about the emissive power of gaseous substances
  at low flame temperatures. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the
  continuity of flame spectra and the specific absorption of water vapor.
