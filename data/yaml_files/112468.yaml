revised_title: 'Lunar-Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Declination: A Comparative Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author discusses the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination and
  its relationship to the solar-diurnal variation. They highlight the similarities
  in the laws governing these variations and their connection to the sun's change
  in declination. The author also notes the opposition of mean curves in the higher
  latitudes of the two hemispheres and the influence of lunar and solar actions on
  magnetic variations.
