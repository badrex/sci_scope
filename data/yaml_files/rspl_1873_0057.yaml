revised_title: 'The Uniform Wave of Oscillation: A Study of Liquid Movement in Oscillatory
  Motion'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the conditions under which molecules of a liquid, such
  as water, move in a state of oscillatory motion. By assuming a uniform wave with
  permanent form and uniform velocity, the author derives equations to describe the
  continuity of the liquid and the effect of forces on the liquid element. The results
  show that each molecule revolves with uniform velocity in a circular orbit, maintaining
  uniform pressure throughout the orbit.
