tldr: The author examines a fossilized jaw and teeth fragment from a large extinct
  lizard (Notiosaurus dentatus) found in Pleistocene deposits in New South Wales,
  Australia. The analysis reveals that the lizard belongs to the Lacertilia division
  and provides evidence of a second form of Lacertian Reptile, distinct from the existing
  Australian species Chlamydosaurus and Hydrosaurus.
