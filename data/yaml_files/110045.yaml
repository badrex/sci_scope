tldr: Charles Bell's study of the nerves of the orbit reveals the distinct functions
  of six brain nerves related to the eye. He demonstrates that the fourth nerve, or
  trochlearis, is responsible for the instinctive and involuntary motions of the eyeball,
  while the third and sixth nerves control voluntary eye movements. Bell also emphasizes
  the importance of anatomical investigation over experiments on living animals in
  advancing the understanding of physiology.
