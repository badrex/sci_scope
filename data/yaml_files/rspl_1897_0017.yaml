revised_title: Investigating Cathode Rays and Their Effects on Carbon and Glass Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the properties of cathode rays and their effects on
  carbon and glass surfaces. They discover that the divergent and convergent cones
  of cathode rays appear to act as if they are hollow, with the luminescent ring on
  carbon surfaces decreasing in diameter as the vacuum increases.

- Cathode Rays
- Cathode Ray Tube
- Surface Luminescence
