revised_title: A Study of Chemical Change in Aqueous Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author develops a method to examine the rate of chemical change in aqueous
  solutions using the 'voltaic balance' technique. The method is applied to solutions
  of potassic iodide and chlorine, and potassic chloride and iodine, revealing the
  influence of temperature, dilution, and agitation on the rate of chemical change.
