revised_title: Elastic Equilibrium of Circular Cylinders under Practical Systems of
  Load
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the elastic equilibrium of circular cylinders under
  various practical systems of load, including pull, compression, and torsion. The
  study focuses on the effects of surface stresses and provides numerical examples
  to demonstrate the distribution of stress and displacement within the cylinders.
