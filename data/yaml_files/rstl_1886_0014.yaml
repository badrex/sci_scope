scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Spectroscopy
tldr: Captain W. de W. Abney maps the solar spectrum between wavelengths 7150 and
  10,000 using diffraction gratings, providing a more complete and accurate representation
  of this region than previous maps. The study improves upon the photographic process
  and discusses the importance of using appropriate apparatus and techniques for accurate
  measurements.
