revised_title: Detection and Analysis of Nitrogenized Matter in the Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric & Environmental Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a method called 'distillation by cold' to detect and analyze
  organic and nitrogenized matter in the atmosphere. This method involves using a
  glass funnel filled with ice to collect dew, which is then tested for ammonia content.
  The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in various environments
  and discusses its potential applications.
