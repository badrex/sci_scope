revised_title: Investigating the Earth's Figure and Gravity Variation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author, James Stirling, explores the Earth's oblate spheroid shape and the
  variation of gravity on its surface due to its rotation. He explains how the decrease
  in gravity from the poles to the equator is proportional to the square of the cosine
  of latitude and how the mean force of gravity on the surface is affected by both
  the spheroid's shape and centrifugal force.
