revised_title: On the Proportionality of Force and Velocity in Moving Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to demonstrate that the force of
  moving bodies is proportional to their velocities, rather than the square of their
  velocities as some have claimed. The experiments involve various mechanical setups
  and demonstrate the relationship between mass, velocity, and force.
topics:
- Momentum
- Newton's Laws of Motion
- Experimental Physics
- Mechanical Power
- Kinetic Energy
