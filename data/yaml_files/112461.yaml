revised_title: Investigating the Force of Muscles and Tendons in Animal Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the cross-sections of various muscles and tendons in the
  human body to determine the relationship between muscle force and cross-sectional
  area. The study finds that the force of contraction per square inch of cross-section
  is consistent across different muscles and that the force of a muscle is proportional
  to the cross-section of the tendon conveying its influence to a distant point.
