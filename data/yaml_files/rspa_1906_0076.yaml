scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The authors describe the pendulum observations made between Kew and Greenwich
  observatories in 1903, using a half-seconds pendulum equipment to measure the time
  of vibration and compare the results. The study aimed to determine the difference
  in time between the two locations and provide insights into the Earth's geophysical
  properties.
