tldr: The study investigates the coelomic fluid of Lumbricus terrestris, focusing
  on its cellular contents, amoeboid cells, and symbiotic microorganisms. The research
  reveals the fluid's physical and chemical properties, as well as its role in a protective
  mechanism involving the earthworm's skin, dorsal pores, and coelomic fluid.
