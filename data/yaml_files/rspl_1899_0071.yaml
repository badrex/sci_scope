revised_title: 'Electrical Resistivity of Electrolytic Nickel: Temperature Dependence'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the electrical resistivity of electrolytic nickel at
  various temperatures, finding that the resistivity decreases steadily as the temperature
  approaches absolute zero. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior
  of metals at low temperatures.
topics:
- Electrical resistivity
- Nickel
- Temperature dependence
- Electrolytic nickel
