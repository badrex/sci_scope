revised_title: On the Development of a General Tide Table for Tidal Prediction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author proposes a method for creating a general tide table applicable for
  all time, allowing anyone with basic knowledge of the Nautical Almanac to compute
  tides for specific days. The method involves using the time of moon's transit and
  time of year as principal variables, with nodal and parallactic corrections for
  more accurate predictions.
topics:
- Tidal prediction
- Harmonic analysis
- Tide-gauge
- Tidal constants
- Tide-tables
