scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Analysis
tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectra of potassium and sodium at low
  temperatures. The authors find that both elements exhibit complex absorption bands,
  with potassium showing bands in the red and sodium displaying bands in the blue,
  red, and yellow. The findings contribute to the understanding of the behavior of
  these elements in various temperature conditions.
