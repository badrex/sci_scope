revised_title: An Experiment on the Specific Gravity of Living Men
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Oceanography
tldr: John Robertson conducts experiments to determine the specific gravity of living
  men, finding that most men are lighter than their equal volume of fresh or sea water.
  This suggests that more people may survive drowning if they remain calm and have
  the presence of mind to avoid panic.
