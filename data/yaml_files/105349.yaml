scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Textile Engineering
tldr: The author discusses the development of improved silk reeling techniques, focusing
  on the Piedmontese reel and its advantages over traditional methods. The Piedmontese
  reel prevents the 'Vitrage' issue, which occurs when silk threads are glued together
  during reeling, and allows for higher quality silk production. The author also presents
  a new, simplified version of the reel that addresses some of the reel's drawbacks.
