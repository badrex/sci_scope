revised_title: 'Maxwell''s Electromagnetic Theory of Light: Extension to Dispersion,
  Metallic Reflection, and Allied Phenomena'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors extend Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light to include dispersion,
  metallic reflection, and related phenomena. They introduce a model of a dielectric
  medium consisting of molecules with charged atoms, and modify Maxwell's equations
  to account for atomic vibrations and rotations. The study explains double refraction
  in crystals, the refractive index of metals, and the relationship between the velocity
  of light and molecular viscosity in metals.
