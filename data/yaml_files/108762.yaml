revised_title: Investigations on Ozone Formation and the Effects of Electrical Discharge
  on Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the volumetric relations of ozone and the effects of
  electrical discharge on oxygen and other gases. They discover that a great condensation
  occurs when oxygen changes into ozone, and that the spark and silent electrical
  discharges have different actions on various gases.

- Ozone
- Electrical Discharge
- Gas Chemistry
