revised_title: Investigating the Toxic Action of Electric Discharge on Bacillus Coli
  Communis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the toxic effects of electric discharge on Bacillus
  coli communis and find that the toxic substances produced by the discharge, such
  as nitric and nitrous acids, are responsible for the lethal effects on bacteria,
  rather than the direct action of the electric current.
