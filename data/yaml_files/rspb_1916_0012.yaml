revised_title: A Reevaluation of Reptilian Classification Based on Hind Foot Structure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines the structure of the hind foot, specifically the fifth metatarsal,
  in various reptile species and finds that its unique shape is consistent across
  multiple orders. This suggests that the hook-shaped metatarsal was present in the
  common ancestor of these forms, providing a valuable clue for understanding reptilian
  phylogeny and classification.
