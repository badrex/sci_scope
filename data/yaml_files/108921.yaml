  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, describes the establishment of self-registering
  magnetometers and galvanometers at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, to study magnetic
  disturbances and terrestrial galvanic currents. The author compares the recorded
  magnetic disturbances with those deduced from corresponding galvanic currents, providing
  insights into the relationship between the two phenomena.
