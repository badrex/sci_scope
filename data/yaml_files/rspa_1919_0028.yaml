revised_title: An Innovative Apparatus for Directly Measuring Accelerations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Oscillations
tldr: The author presents an innovative apparatus for measuring accelerations, overcoming
  the limitations of traditional pendulum-based methods. The device utilizes piezo-electricity
  to directly measure the pressure exerted by the acceleration on a quartz or tourmaline
  plate, providing a more accurate and reliable method for determining accelerations
  in various seismic and structural applications.
