revised_title: On the Condensation Nuclei Produced in Gases by the Action of Röntgen
  Rays, Uranium Rays, and Other Agents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the condensation nuclei produced in gases by various
  agents, including Röntgen rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. The study
  reveals that exposure to these agents causes the formation of nuclei that require
  a specific degree of supersaturation for water to condense upon them.
