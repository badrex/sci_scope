tldr: The article recounts the experience of an earthquake felt at Plymouth in February
  1749-50, as reported by the Commissioner of His Majesty's Dock-Yard, Philip Vanbrugh,
  and other residents. The accounts describe a sudden shake that affected their beds
  and caused trembling motions in nearby objects. Due to the late hour and strong
  winds, many initially attributed the event to the wind, and it took a month for
  inquiries to be made.
