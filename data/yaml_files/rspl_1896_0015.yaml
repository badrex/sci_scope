scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Elemental Compounds
tldr: Ramsay and Collie conduct a series of experiments to test the possibility of
  forming compounds of helium and argon. Despite using various methods and reagents,
  they find no evidence of any compounds being formed, suggesting that these elements
  are non-valent and incapable of forming chemical bonds.
