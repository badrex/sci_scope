tldr: The author investigates the properties and reactions of zincethyl, a compound
  formed by the action of zinc on iodide of ethyl. The study reveals that zincethyl
  is highly reactive and belongs to the water type, consisting of two volumes of ethyl
  and one volume of zinc vapour. It is spontaneously flammable in atmospheric air
  or oxygen and decomposes when exposed to water, hydrated acids, and hydrogen compounds
  of various elements. The research supports the molecular symmetrical form of organometallic
  compounds and sheds light on the behavior of electro-negative elements during chemical
  change.
