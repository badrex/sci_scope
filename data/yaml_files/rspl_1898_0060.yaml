revised_title: On the Phenomenon of Surfusion in Metals and Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of surfusion in metals and alloys, using
  a recording pyrometer to measure temperature changes during the solidification process.
  The experiments reveal that surfusion occurs in various metals and alloys, and the
  phenomenon can be observed through distinct curves on a temperature-time graph.
