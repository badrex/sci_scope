revised_title: 'Electric and Magnetic Fluids: A Single Undecomposable Fluid'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism
tldr: W. F. Stevenson argues that electricity is a single undecomposable fluid, and
  the distinction between vitreous and resinous, or positive and negative electricities,
  is derived from the direction of its motion and the circumstances under which it
  is presented. He also suggests that magnetic fluid obeys the same law as the electric
  fluid, moving in a current with positive and negative polarities.
