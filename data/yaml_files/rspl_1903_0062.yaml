scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: This study investigates the role of blood fluids in the process of phagocytosis,
  using modified experimental methods to test the phagocytic power of blood. The authors
  find that blood fluids may play a role in the destruction of pathogenic bacteria,
  and that the experimental methods used provide accurate and consistent results.
