scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: Thomas Beddoes describes experiments conducted by Mr. Walker on the production
  of artificial cold using various chemical mixtures and reactions. These experiments
  include freezing water, diluting spirits, and even freezing mercury. The results
  suggest that certain combinations of salts and acids can produce significant drops
  in temperature, with potential applications in scientific research and beyond.
