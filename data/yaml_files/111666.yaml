tldr: This article presents the results of calculations for elliptic motion, focusing
  on the development of functions and formulas related to the theory. The author,
  Arthur Cayley, provides a detailed explanation of the notation and methods used,
  as well as tabulating various functions and their expansions in multiple cosines
  and sines up to the terms in e^7.
