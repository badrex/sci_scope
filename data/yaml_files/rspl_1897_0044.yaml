revised_title: The Sensitivity of Retinal Cells to Light and Color
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: The author investigates the sensitivity of the retina to light and color, discovering
  that the smallest diameter of the illuminated spot governs the necessary reduction
  in light intensity. He also finds that color fields are of the same form, with the
  extent depending solely on the illumination and the area of the surface. The author
  suggests a modification to the accepted theory of light and color to explain the
  connection between the two.
