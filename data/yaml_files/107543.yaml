revised_title: Inflammable Gaseous Compounds from Destructive Distillation of Coal
  and Oil
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the composition and analysis of inflammable gaseous
  compounds resulting from the destructive distillation of coal and oil, examining
  their relative heating and illuminating powers. The experiments reveal that coal
  gas is a mixture of olefiant and hydrogen gases, and provide insights into the composition
  and properties of these gaseous mixtures.
