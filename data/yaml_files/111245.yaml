revised_title: Anatomy and Physiology of the Heart's Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, Robert Lee, presents dissections of a racehorse's heart, demonstrating
  a dense network of nerves and ganglia throughout the heart's muscular structure.
  This challenges the belief that the heart's sensitive and contractile powers are
  independent of nervous influence, and provides insight into the heart's function
  as an organ, blood circulation, and the action of detached heart parts.
