scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Celestial Objects
tldr: The author analyzes the spectrum of Nova Aurigae, a celestial event, and observes
  several spectral lines. The study suggests that the broadening of these lines may
  be due to internal agitation, and the dark lines on the more refrangible sides of
  the bright hydrogen lines could be a valuable confirmation of the hypothesis that
  new stars are formed by the collision of meteor swarms.
