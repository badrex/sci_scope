revised_title: Experiments on Torsion and Flexure for the Determination of Rigidities
  in Malleable Iron, Cast Iron, and Copper Rods
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author conducts experiments on malleable iron, cast iron, and copper rods
  to determine their torsional and flexural rigidities. The results provide values
  for Poisson's ratio and other mechanical properties of these materials, contributing
  to the understanding of their behavior under stress.
