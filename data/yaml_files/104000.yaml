revised_title: The Role of Male Seed in the Impregnation of Plant Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: James Logan's experiments on the impregnation of seeds in plants reveal that
  male seeds, or the farina faecundans, play a crucial role in the growth and development
  of seeds. By manipulating the conditions of the Indian corn plant, Logan demonstrates
  that the absence of male seeds results in the failure of seed development.
