tldr: George Boole investigates the analytical conditions of a method for solving
  problems in probability theory, proposing a new approach using logical symbols and
  the Calculus of Logic to translate and simplify complex data. He also discusses
  the importance of the 'principle of order' in constructing problems and the role
  of logical connections in determining probabilities.
