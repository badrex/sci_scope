revised_title: 'The Limiting Thickness of Liquid Films: Electrical and Optical Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors investigate the limiting thickness of liquid films using electrical
  and optical experiments. They develop a new liquid solution that consistently forms
  black films and measure the thickness of these films using both electrical resistance
  and optical refraction methods. Their findings provide a more accurate understanding
  of the properties of thin liquid films.
