revised_title: Observations on the Modes of Division of Spirocheta Recurrentis and
  S. Duttoni in Living Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the modes of division in Spirocheta
  recurrentis and S. duttoni, observing both longitudinal and transverse divisions
  in living organisms. They argue that the direction of division cannot be used as
  a sole criterion for determining whether Spirochaetes are protozoa or bacteria,
  as they exhibit characteristics of both.
