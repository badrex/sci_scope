revised_title: The Specific Heat of Carbon Dioxide as a Function of Temperature
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the variation of carbon dioxide's specific heat at constant
  volume with temperature. The author constructs a steam calorimeter to conduct experiments
  at various densities and temperature intervals. Results show that the specific heat
  decreases with increasing temperature, with the lowest densities exhibiting little
  to no variation.
