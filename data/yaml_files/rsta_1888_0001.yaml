revised_title: The Effect of Magnetisation on the Elasticity and Internal Friction
  of Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, specifically focusing on the effect of magnetisation on the elasticity
  and internal friction of metals. The study finds that the internal friction remains
  constant under a sustained magnetising stress, but increases when the magnetising
  current is interrupted or reversed.
topics:
- Magnetisation
- Internal Friction
- Elasticity
- Torsional Vibration
- Molecular Friction
