revised_title: Ascent of Meteorological Balloons and the Temperature of the Upper
  Air
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the ascent of meteorological balloons and the temperature
  of the upper air, finding that an almost constant temperature is reached when the
  pressure has decreased to about 150 mm. The study examines the factors affecting
  the velocity of ascent and the maximum height a balloon can reach, as well as comparing
  the observed temperatures with adiabatic temperatures.
