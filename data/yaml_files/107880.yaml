revised_title: The Effects of Dividing Lungs Nerves and the Influence of Voltaic Electricity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuroscience
tldr: The author investigates the effects of dividing the nerves of the lungs and
  subjecting them to voltaic electricity. The results show that dividing the nerves
  of vital organs deranges their functions, but transmitting voltaic electricity through
  the nerves can restore their functions.
