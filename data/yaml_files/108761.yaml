scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the equation of differences for
  equations of any order, focusing on equations of the second, third, fourth, and
  fifth orders. The method involves using covariants and seminvariants, and simplifying
  the process of elimination. The author demonstrates the application of this method
  to various equations and shows how to obtain the equation of differences for equations
  of higher orders.
