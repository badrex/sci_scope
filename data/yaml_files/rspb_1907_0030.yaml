revised_title: Investigation of Mitosis in Proliferating Epithelium
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The study investigates mitosis in proliferating epithelium, specifically examining
  somatic and reduction mitoses in artificially stimulated rabbit skin. The research
  finds that both types of mitosis occur in non-cancerous epithelial proliferation,
  suggesting a possible connection between altered biological characteristics of malignant
  growths and the reduction in the number of chromosomes.
