revised_title: 'Electrical Experiments at Cliefden: Conveying Electricity 420 Feet'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author describes electrical experiments conducted at Cliefden, where electricity
  was successfully conveyed 420 feet using a packthread string. The experiment was
  challenging due to the size of the string, which was attributed to the animal substance
  still sticking to the packthread. The experiment was successful after the packthread
  was wet with a sponge to wash off the size, and the weather was found to have a
  significant influence on the experiment.
