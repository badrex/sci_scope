revised_title: Automatic Temperature Compensation of Magnetometers and Meteorological
  Instruments using Photography
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Measurement
tldr: The author presents a method for automatically compensating magnetometers and
  meteorological instruments for temperature changes using photography. The technique
  involves a glass rod and zinc tubes that expand and contract with temperature changes,
  adjusting the suspension skein's lower interval accordingly. This method allows
  for more accurate readings of magnetic force and temperature variations.
