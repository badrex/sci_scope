revised_title: Investigating the Changes in the Brightness of Stars and the Inaccuracy
  of the Magnitude System
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Navigation & Star Classification
tldr: The author, William Herschel, critiques the current method of classifying stars
  by magnitudes, as it relies on an imaginary standard and lacks accuracy. He suggests
  that stars may have different sizes and distances, which makes the classification
  system unreliable for precise observations.
