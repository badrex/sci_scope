revised_title: 'On the Convection of Heat from Small Cylinders in a Stream of Fluid:
  Determination of the Convection Constants of Small Platinum Wires with Applications
  to Hot-Wire Anemometry'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the convection of heat from small cylinders in a fluid
  stream, determining the convection constants of small platinum wires and their applications
  in hot-wire anemometry. They provide a mathematical theory and experimental determination
  of the convection constants, with implications for the design of hot-wire anemometers.
