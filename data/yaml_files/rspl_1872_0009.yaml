revised_title: Synthesis of Aromatic Monamines via Intramolecular Atomic Interchange
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of aromatic monamines by intramolecular
  atomic interchange, specifically focusing on the transformation of trimethylphenylammonium
  iodide under heat and pressure. The reaction results in the formation of various
  aromatic compounds, including dimethyltoluidine, methylxylidine, and trimethylophenylamine,
  demonstrating a method for rising from one carbonated series to another.
