revised_title: Synthesis of Acetic Acid through Methyl-Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Synthesis
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of acetic acid using methyl-compounds
  and finds that it follows the same reaction pattern as other members of the vinic
  series. The reaction involves sodium-methyl and zinc-methyl, which, when exposed
  to carbonic acid, produce a distillate with the smell and taste of acetic acid.
