  and the House Fly
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The author examines the adhesion mechanisms of the Lacerta Gecko and the house
  fly, discovering similarities in the way they maintain their grip on surfaces despite
  gravity. The study reveals that both animals use a combination of vacuum-like structures
  and specialized surface textures to adhere to various surfaces.
