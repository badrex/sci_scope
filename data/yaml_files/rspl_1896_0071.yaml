revised_title: Investigating Lunar Periodicities in Earthquake Frequency
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Tectonics
tldr: The author analyzes earthquake data from Japan to investigate the potential
  lunar periodicities in earthquake frequency. The study finds that any lunar-diurnal
  periodicity is likely due to tidal stresses acting directly on the earth's crust,
  rather than indirectly through ocean tides.
