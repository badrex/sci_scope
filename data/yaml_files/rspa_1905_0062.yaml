revised_title: Improving the Direct Method for Measuring Ionic Velocities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors develop an improved method for measuring ionic velocities using
  dilute solutions and eliminating the need for gelatine or other partitions. They
  successfully measure transport numbers and average absolute velocities of various
  salts, confirming previous findings by Kohlrausch.
