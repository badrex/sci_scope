scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Endocrinology
tldr: This study investigates the estrous cycle and the formation of the corpus luteum
  in sheep, providing insights into the reproductive biology of the species. The research
  examines the different stages of the estrous cycle, including the prooestrum, oestrus,
  metoestrum, and dioestrum, and their effects on the ovaries and uterus. The formation
  of the corpus luteum and its role in sheep reproduction are also discussed, highlighting
  the importance of understanding these processes for breeding and management purposes.
