revised_title: Investigation of Triple Prussiates and Peculiar Acids Formed by Prussic
  Acid Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Acid-Base Chemistry
tldr: The author examines the properties of triple prussiates and proposes that they
  are binary salts consisting of a single base and a complex acid containing iron
  and prussic acid elements. He also discovers a new type of acid, which he calls
  Chyazic acid, formed by combining prussic acid elements with other substances like
  sulfur. This acid has unique properties and can be used as a precipitant for copper.
