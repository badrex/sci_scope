revised_title: 'The Photoelectric Effect of X-Rays: A Review of Richardson''s Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author discusses Richardson's experiments on the photoelectric effect of
  X-rays, which demonstrated that the energy of electrons emitted from a material
  is directly related to the frequency of the incident radiation. This supports the
  idea that the photoelectric effect is a quantum process, where energy is transferred
  in discrete packets.
