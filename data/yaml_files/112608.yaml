revised_title: 'Electrostatic Indications of Animal Electricity: A New Method of Experimentation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author presents a new method of experimentation to detect electrostatic
  indications of animal electricity using two electroscopes. This method eliminates
  the reaction of the charge of electricity in the instruments, making it easier to
  observe the action of very minute quantities of electricity.
