tldr: The author examines the urinary organs and secretions of various amphibians,
  specifically serpents, lizards, and turtles/tortoises. He discovers that the urinary
  organs of these animals are similar in structure and function, and that their urine
  primarily consists of uric acid. This finding highlights the close anatomical and
  physiological connections between these seemingly dissimilar animals.
