revised_title: Effect of Pressure on Electric Conductibility in Metallic Wires
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Conductivity
tldr: The author, M. Elie Wartmann, investigates the effect of pressure on electric
  conductibility in metallic wires using an electrical bridge method. The experiments
  show that a pressure of thirty atmospheres diminishes the conducting power of a
  copper wire for electricity, and the effect increases with the pressure. The primitive
  conducting power is restored when the pressure vanishes altogether.
