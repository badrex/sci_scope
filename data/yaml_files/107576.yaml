revised_title: Discovery of Fulminating Platinum and Its Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: Edmund Davy discovers a new fulminating platinum compound, which shares similar
  properties with aurum fulminans. The compound serves to extend the existing analogies
  between noble metals and fills a vacant space in their chemical history. Fulminating
  platinum can explode when heated, and its explosive force appears to be exerted
  in all directions, primarily downwards.
