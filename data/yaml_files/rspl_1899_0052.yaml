revised_title: 'The Absorption of RÃ¶ntgen''s Rays by Aqueous Solutions of Metallic
  Salts: A Study of the Effect of Atomic Weight and Acid Radicle'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of X-rays by aqueous solutions of metallic
  salts and find that the absorbing power depends on the atomic weight and not the
  density or combining proportions of the substances. They also discover that the
  total absorption produced by a solution is the sum of the absorptions of the salt
  and its solvent.
