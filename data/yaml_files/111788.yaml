scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author examines the distribution of perihelia and nodes of planets, discovering
  a strong tendency for these elements to fall within specific heliocentric semicircles.
  The author suggests that an undiscovered law may be influencing the orbits of planets,
  and invites further analysis to explore this phenomenon.
