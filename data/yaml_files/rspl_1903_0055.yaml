scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the differential invariants of space and surfaces, developing
  methods to find the most general solution of the equations associated with these
  invariants. The study focuses on obtaining explicit expressions for invariants up
  to the third order and geometrically interpreting those of the second order. The
  author also predicts the existence of two new fundamental equations related to a
  surface when the significance of these invariants is fully understood.
