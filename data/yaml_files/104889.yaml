tldr: The author presents new experiments and observations on electricity, using a
  large electrical machine with multiple globes. He discusses the increase in electrical
  power, the conductivity of originally-electrics, and the accumulation of electrical
  power in a phial of water. The author also refutes the idea that electrical effluvia
  are of a sulphureous nature.
