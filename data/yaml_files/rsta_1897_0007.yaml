revised_title: An Investigation of the Adiabatic Relations of Ethyl Oxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the adiabatic relations and isentropic curves of ethyl
  oxide, focusing on its behavior as a gas and liquid. They use a modified Kundt's
  process to determine the velocity of sound in the liquid or gas, and present experimental
  data for further analysis.

- Ethyloxyde
- Adiabatic Relations
- Isentropic Curves
