revised_title: Magnetism in Hot-Rolled and Cold-Rolled Malleable Iron
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the difference in magnetism properties between hot-rolled
  and cold-rolled malleable iron. The study reveals that cold-rolled iron receives
  and retains a greater amount of induced magnetism compared to hot-rolled iron, with
  cold-rolled iron having a higher tendency to retain its magnetism.
