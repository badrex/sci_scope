tldr: This paper describes a series of observations made in 1825 to determine the
  difference in meridians between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris.
  The observations involved the use of signals, such as explosions of gunpowder, and
  were conducted by British and French teams. The final result found the difference
  in longitude between the two observatories to be 9Â° 21' 1 6, with a high degree
  of accuracy.
