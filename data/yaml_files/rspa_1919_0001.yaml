revised_title: Observation and Analysis of Haidinger's Rings in Mica
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Crystallography
tldr: The authors describe a simple method for observing and photographing Haidinger's
  rings in mica using a cardboard sheet with a small hole and a green light filter.
  They analyze the rings' formation and discuss the relationship between the lines
  of minimum visibility and isochromatic lines in convergent polarized light.
