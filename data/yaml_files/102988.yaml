scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to measure the rebound of marbles in different
  air conditions, including common air, vacuum, and air condensed. The results show
  that marbles rebound higher in vacuum and slightly less in air condensed compared
  to common air.
