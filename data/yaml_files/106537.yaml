  Objects
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a general theory for measuring the angle subtended by two
  objects observed by rays after two reflections from plane surfaces and directly
  by the observer's eye. This theory can be applied to various practical purposes
  in observational astronomy.
