revised_title: 'The Explosion of Pure Electrolytic Gas: A Photographic Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: Dixon and Bradshaw investigate the explosion of pure electrolytic gas, specifically
  hydrogen and oxygen, and find that the absence of water vapor does not influence
  the explosion once the flame has been initiated by a spark.
topics:
- Chemical Reactions
- Electrolysis
- Hydrogen and Oxygen Interactions
- Explosion Phenomena
- Gas Mixtures
