revised_title: 'On the Refraction and Dispersion of Krypton and Xenon: A Comparative
  Study with Helium and Argon'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive indices and dispersive powers of krypton,
  xenon, helium, and argon using Jamin's refractometer. They find that the refractive
  indices and relative path retardation of these gases are linear functions of their
  refractivity for infinite wavelengths, and discuss the accuracy and limitations
  of their measurements.
