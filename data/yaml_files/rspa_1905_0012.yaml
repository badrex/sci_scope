revised_title: 'Further Researches on the Temperature Classification of Stars: Comparing
  Genera on the Same Temperature Horizon'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Physics
tldr: Sir Norman Lockyer investigates the temperature classification of stars by comparing
  the spectra of stars on the same temperature horizon. He finds that the spectra
  of these stars show no significant differences in temperature, indicating that their
  temperatures are approximately the same.
