scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author, Martin Triewald, shares an experiment where he plants melon seeds
  that are 42 years old and successfully grows healthy plants, producing flowers and
  melons. This demonstrates that melon seeds can retain their vegetative quality for
  an extended period and that using older seeds can still yield good results.
