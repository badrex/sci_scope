revised_title: Experiments on the Development of Bacteria in Organic Infusions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the development of bacteria in organic
  infusions, specifically hay and turnip infusions, to study their life-history and
  life-conditions. They found that bacteria appeared in the infusions, even when precautions
  were taken to prevent contamination, suggesting that further research is needed
  to understand the hypothesis of spontaneous generation.
