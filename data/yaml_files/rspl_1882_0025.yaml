revised_title: General Observations on the Spectra of Carbon and its Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of carbon and its compounds, focusing on
  the cyanogen spectrum and its variations in different gaseous environments. They
  observe the effects of electric discharge on carbon spectra and discuss the conditions
  that cause variations in intensity and development of the carbon flutings.

- Spectroscopy
- Carbon Spectra
- Cyanogen Spectrum
- Arc Discharge
- Electric Discharge
