revised_title: The Correlation of Synthetic and Hydrolytic Activity in Lipase
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: This study investigates the correlation between the synthetic and hydrolytic
  activity of lipase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fat metabolism. The authors
  find that lipase is more effective in insoluble, oily environments and that water
  has a significant impact on enzyme activity, slowing down the rate of hydrolysis
  and shifting the equilibrium point.
topics:
- Lipase
- Enzyme action
- Fat synthesis
- Fat hydrolysis
- Effect of water on enzyme activity
