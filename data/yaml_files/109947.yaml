revised_title: Improving the Method of Cutting Rock Crystal for Micrometers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes three methods of cutting rock
  crystal wedges for micrometers and explains how to increase the degree of double
  refraction. By combining two wedges with their axes of crystallization positioned
  differently, the separation of the images can be doubled, resulting in a more effective
  micrometer.
