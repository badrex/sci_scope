revised_title: Improving the Design and Construction of Thermometers for Measuring
  High Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: Josiah Wedgwood describes his experiments and improvements in creating thermometers
  for measuring high heat. He discusses the issues with clay composition, molding,
  and pressing techniques, and ultimately develops a new design with a circular cross-section
  to minimize irregularities in heat measurement.
