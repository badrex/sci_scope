revised_title: Determination of the Indices of Refraction of Glass for Electric Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author investigates the index of refraction of glass for electric radiation
  using a modified experimental setup and discovers that the index varies with the
  frequency of the electric field. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on
  the relationship between the dielectric constant and refractive index for long electric
  waves.
