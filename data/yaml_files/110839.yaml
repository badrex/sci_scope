  Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author, George Boole, presents a new method of analysis for solving linear
  differential equations and generating functions. This method, called the exponential
  form, allows for easier solution of equations with both constant and variable coefficients,
  and can be applied to partial and total equations.
