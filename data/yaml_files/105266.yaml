tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of the variation of the magnetic needle
  from 1700 to 1756, using over 50,000 observations. The authors provide tables adapted
  to every five degrees of latitude and longitude, highlighting the variation's patterns
  and irregularities. They conclude that the variation is influenced by various magnetic
  attractions, possibly due to the Earth's heterogeneous composition.
