revised_title: Investigating the Laws of Peaks and Hollows in Kew Magnetic Curves
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author analyzes the peaks and hollows exhibited in the Kew Magnetic Curves
  for the first two years of their production, investigating the elementary forces
  involved in producing disturbances and the nature of these forces. The study reveals
  a diurnal variation in the type of peak-and-hollow force and suggests that local
  causes, such as earth-currents, may be involved in some disturbances.
