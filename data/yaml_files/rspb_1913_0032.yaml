revised_title: Investigating the Function of the Glomerulus and Tubules in Frog Kidneys
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the function of the glomerulus and tubules in frog kidneys
  using perfusion techniques. They demonstrate that the renal portal vein supplies
  the entire tubule, while the glomerulus remains unaffected. The study also shows
  that the tubules can maintain their normal histological appearance and secrete urine
  even after complete occlusion of the glomeruli, suggesting that they possess the
  capacity to absorb water and solids.
