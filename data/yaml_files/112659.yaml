revised_title: Maxwell's Theory on the Maintenance of Electric Currents by Mechanical
  Work
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, investigates the theory of maintaining electric
  currents by mechanical work without using permanent magnets. He explores the effects
  of electromagnetic momentum and the role of commutators in electric circuits, providing
  a rough explanation of the underlying principles.
