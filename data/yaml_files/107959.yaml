tldr: 'The author presents a mathematical analysis of the perturbations of celestial
  bodies using two methods: variation of parameters and integration of differential
  equations. The results obtained from both methods are compared and found to be substantially
  identical, confirming the accuracy of the expressions used. The author also discusses
  the application of these methods to the theory of the moon and provides equations
  for determining the variations of elliptic constants.'
