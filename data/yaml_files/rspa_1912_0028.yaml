revised_title: The Discovery of the Penetration of Cathode Rays through Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the transmission of cathode rays through matter and
  their ionization properties. They find that cathode rays can penetrate several millimeters
  of air and develop a method to determine their maximum speed and range in an ionization
  chamber.
