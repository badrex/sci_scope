revised_title: A Further Minute Analysis of the Motor Region of the Cortex Cerebri
  in the Monkey
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the motor region of the cortex cerebri in the monkey
  (Macacus sinicus) using electric stimulation. They analyze the effects of stimulating
  different areas of the motor region and describe the topography of the representation
  of body parts in the monkey brain. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of motor control and brain mapping.
