revised_title: Comparative Analysis of Blood Corpuscles in Insects and Vertebrates
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Comparative Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the development and function of blood corpuscles in insects
  and other invertebrates, comparing them to those in humans and vertebrates. He observes
  that the blood corpuscles in insects undergo a series of changes, similar to the
  development of secreting cells in glands. The author also compares the blood corpuscles
  of insects to those of vertebrates, suggesting that they share a similar mode of
  development.
