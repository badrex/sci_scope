tldr: This study examines the anatomy and function of the mammalian eye, focusing
  on ophthalmoscopic examination of 181 different species. The research explores various
  aspects of the eye, including color determination, vascularization, and the role
  of the tapetum and choroidal pigment. The findings suggest that the image formation
  in the eye may not occur on the retina as traditionally believed, but rather on
  the choroidal pigment layer, which then reflects the image back onto the retina.
