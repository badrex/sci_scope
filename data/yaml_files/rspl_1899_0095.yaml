revised_title: 'The Velocity of Ions Produced in Gases by Röntgen Rays: Experimental
  Determination and Comparison'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of positive and negative ions produced
  in gases by Röntgen rays using an electric field setup. They determine the ionic
  velocity in a unit electric field and compare their results with previous findings,
  providing insights into the charges carried by different ions and their relationship
  to electrolysis.
topics:
- Ion Velocity
- Röntgen Rays
- Electric Fields
- Gas Ionization
- Ionization Techniques
