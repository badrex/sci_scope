tldr: Smithson Tennant investigates the nature of diamonds and discovers that they
  consist entirely of charcoal, differing from the usual state of that substance only
  by their crystallized form. He also confirms that diamonds contain fixed air, similar
  to other inflammable bodies, through a series of experiments involving heat and
  combustion.
