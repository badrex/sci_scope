revised_title: Extending Cardan's Rule for Resolving Cubic Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author extends Cardan's rule for resolving cubic equations to the irreducible
  case, using Sir Isaac Newton's binomial theorem. The method involves deriving a
  new expression for the value of x in the equation xÂ³ - qx = r, when r is less than
  2q ~ q/3 ~ 3.
