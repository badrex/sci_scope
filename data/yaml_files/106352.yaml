scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Approximation
tldr: The author presents a method for approximating the value of slowly-converging
  infinite series using Sir Isaac Newton's binomial theorem. The method involves finding
  a near value of the series by manipulating the generating fractions and applying
  the binomial theorem. The author demonstrates the method on the series X + xx/2
  + x3/3 + x4/4 + x5/5 +... when X is nearly equal to 1.
