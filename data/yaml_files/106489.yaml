revised_title: Observations on Wire Shortening by Lightning
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author shares an account of wire being shortened by lightning, describing
  the incident at Mr. Parker's house in Stoke Newington. The lightning passed through
  a leaden pipe and struck a crank iron, shortening the wire of a night-bolt. The
  wire was found straight and tight, with a musical tone produced when struck. This
  instance suggests that lightning often breaks or contracts wires, and the author
  presents samples for the Royal Society's inspection.
