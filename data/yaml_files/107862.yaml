revised_title: On the Efficiency of Machines and the Inefficiency of the Recoil Engine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machine Design
tldr: The author proposes a new term, 'efficiency,' for the function of force multiplied
  by space, to measure the effectiveness of machines. He investigates the recoil engine
  and concludes that it is inefficient compared to other engines like the water wheel
  and pressure engine. The author also discusses the self-regulating power of water
  wheels and the impracticality of the recoil engine's design.
topics:
- Mechanical efficiency
- Machine efficiency
- Recoil engine
- Steam engine
- Duty and efficiency in machines
