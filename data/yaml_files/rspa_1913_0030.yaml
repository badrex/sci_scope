revised_title: 'The Abnormal Kinetic Energy of Ions in a Gas: A Theoretical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: This paper investigates the abnormal kinetic energy of ions in a gas and explores
  the validity of the law of equipartition of energy. The author analyzes the kinetic
  theory of gases and compares theoretical predictions with observed values, suggesting
  that the law of equipartition may not hold when external forces are present.

- Kinetic Theory of Gases
- Ion Kinetic Energy
- Electric Force
