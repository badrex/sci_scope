tldr: Commander James Clark Ross presents observations made during his arctic expedition
  to determine the position of the North Magnetic Pole. He discusses the irregularity
  of the Earth's magnetic distribution and the difficulties encountered in making
  accurate observations. Ross concludes that a spot in north latitude 70° 5' 17" and
  west longitude 96° 45' 48" can be considered as the true magnetic pole or a very
  close approximation to it.
