revised_title: A Conjecture on Under-Currents and Tides in the Mediterranean Sea
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: The author proposes a conjecture that an under-current is responsible for the
  lack of rising water levels along the Mediterranean coast. He provides evidence
  from observations of tides in the Downs and the Baltic Sound, suggesting that a
  strong under-current could carry out as much water as flows in, thus preventing
  any noticeable rise in water levels.
