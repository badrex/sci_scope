tldr: In this paper, Baden Powell compares the results of M. Cauchy's system of undulations
  with observed refractive indices in different media, including a new series of data
  by M. Rudberg. He finds that the coincidences between theory and observation are
  close, providing further confirmation of the law assigned by the hypothesis of undulations.
