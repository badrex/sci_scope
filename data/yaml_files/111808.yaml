scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Combinatorics
tldr: Arthur Cayley investigates the partition of numbers and introduces the concept
  of prime circulators. He demonstrates how to express the analytical form of the
  number of partitions and how to determine the coefficients of prime circulators
  in these expressions.
