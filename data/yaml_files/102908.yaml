scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the role of flowers in plant reproduction, suggesting that
  the pollen grains act as plant sperm and are transported through specialized tubes
  to fertilize the ovules. This theory provides a more accurate understanding of plant
  reproduction and its similarities to animal reproduction.
