revised_title: On the Microrheometer and the Flow of Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author develops a microrheometer to study the flow of liquids through capillary
  tubes and examines the flow rates of various saline solutions. The results show
  that the rate of flow is dependent on the mass of the elements forming the substance
  and the amount of energy expended in its formation.

- Microrheometry
- Capillary Flow
- Saline Solutions
- Chemical Equivalents
