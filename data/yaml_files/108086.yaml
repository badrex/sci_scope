tldr: The author examines the optical properties of certain crystals, specifically
  borax crystals, using a polarizing microscope. They discover a unique phenomenon
  where the crystals exhibit a dark cross when viewed under crossed polarizers, revealing
  the intricate structure and optical properties of these tiny crystalline formations.
