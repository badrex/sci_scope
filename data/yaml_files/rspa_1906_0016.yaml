revised_title: Artificial Double Refraction and Eolotropic Distribution in Colloidal
  Solutions and Magnetic Fields
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the optical properties of colloidal solutions and their
  response to magnetic fields, discovering that the solutions exhibit artificial double
  refraction due to eolotropic distribution. They develop a formal theory to explain
  the phenomena and discuss the similarities between the effects of mechanical stress
  and magnetic action on the solutions.
