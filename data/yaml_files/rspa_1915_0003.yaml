revised_title: 'Hermann''s Phenomenon: Acid and Alkali Liberation at Electrochemical
  Boundaries'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates Hermann's phenomenon, which involves the liberation
  of acid and alkali at the boundaries of two fluids when an electric current is passed
  through them. The experiments confirm and expand on Hermann's original observations,
  providing a rational explanation in terms of electrolytic dissociation.
