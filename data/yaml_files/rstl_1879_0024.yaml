tldr: The author describes the Neuroptera and other insect collections made during
  the Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75. The true Neuroptera are abundant in
  Kerguelen Island, and the author discusses the uncertainty of their indigenous status.
  The species Rhyopsocus eclipticus, though described from a single example, may have
  accompanied the American Transit of Venus Expedition and its habitat is uncertain.
