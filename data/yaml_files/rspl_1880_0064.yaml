revised_title: 'Further Experiments on the Action of an Intermittent Beam of Radiant
  Heat on Gaseous Matter: Thermometric Measurements'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts further experiments on the action of an intermittent beam
  of radiant heat on gaseous matter, focusing on thermometric measurements. He examines
  the sounds produced by various liquids and validates his previous findings on aqueous
  vapor using the thermometric method.
topics:
- Thermodynamics
- Heat Transfer
- Thermometry
- Gas Dynamics
- Sound Production
