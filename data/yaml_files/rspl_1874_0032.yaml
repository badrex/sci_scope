revised_title: 'The Structure and Development of Myriothela: A Study of Cnidarian
  Development and Nervous System Hypothesis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines the structure and development of Myriothela, a cnidarian
  species, and investigates the role of the endoderm and ectoderm in its development.
  The study also explores the hypothesis that the deep layer of ectodermal cells in
  Myriothela represents a nervous system, providing insights into the evolution of
  nervous systems in animals.
