revised_title: Investigation of Sound Velocity and Dulong's Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: Dr. Simons compares M. Dulong's experiments on the velocity of sound with the
  results of Drs. Moll and Van Beek's observations, finding that Dulong's calculations
  bring the velocity of sound calculations closer to the truth, but still with some
  discrepancies that may be due to errors in the complex observations.
