tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the quadrature of a portion of
  the epicycloid, a mathematical curve, using geometric and algebraic techniques.
  The approach involves comparing the segments of the generant circle to the corresponding
  segments of the epicycloid and provides a general proposition for all curves of
  this kind.
