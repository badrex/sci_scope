revised_title: On the Electromagnetic Theory of Reflection and Refraction of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic theory of reflection and refraction
  of light, considering the case of reflection at the surface of a magnetized medium.
  The study provides expressions for the amplitudes of the reflected and refracted
  rays and demonstrates the effect of magnetization on the reflected ray's polarization.
