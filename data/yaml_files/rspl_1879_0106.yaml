revised_title: The Existence of Potassium Hyposulphite in Fired Gunpowder Residues
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the existence of potassium hyposulphite in the solid
  residue of fired gunpowder and find that its presence is consequent upon slight
  variations during the explosion process. They also discuss the method used to determine
  the proportions of potassium monosulphide and hyposulphite in a powder residue.
