revised_title: Measurement of Electromotive Force and Spark Discharge in Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author, W. Thomson, investigates the relationship between the distance between
  metal plates and the electromotive force required to produce a spark in air. The
  results show that a thin stratum of air requires a greater electromotive force per
  unit length to produce a spark compared to a thicker stratum, challenging existing
  theories on electric force and pressure.
