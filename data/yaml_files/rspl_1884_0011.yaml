tldr: This article documents the nutritional intake and health of Mr. Edward Payson
  Weston during his 5,000-mile walk in 100 days. The author analyzes Weston's ingesta
  and egesta, as well as his pulse and respiration, to determine the effects of such
  a strenuous physical feat on the human body. The results show that Weston maintained
  robust health throughout the walk, consuming a diet rich in carbohydrates, albuminoids,
