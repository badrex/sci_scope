revised_title: On the Simultaneous Distribution of Heat and Synthermal Lines
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of heat in the atmosphere, land, and
  water, proposing the concept of synthermal lines to represent simultaneous equal
  temperatures. Using synthermal tables, the author demonstrates temperature differences
  between places in the same latitude and the existence of hot and cold spaces within
  continents compared to surrounding oceans.
