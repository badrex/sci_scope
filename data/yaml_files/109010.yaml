revised_title: Investigation of Specific Heat in Mixtures of Ethylic Alcohol and Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors, A. Dupr√© and F.J.M. Page, investigate the specific heat of mixtures
  of ethylic alcohol and water. They find that the specific heat of these mixtures,
  up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%, is higher than the specific heat of water,
  which has always been considered to possess the highest specific heat of any substance
  solid or liquid.
