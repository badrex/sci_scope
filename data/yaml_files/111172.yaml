tldr: The author examines the iris and its motions, exploring its relationship with
  the nervous system. They demonstrate that the iris is influenced by the ophthalmic
  ganglion, sympathetic system, retina, and cerebral nervous arc. The study also reveals
  that contraction is the active state of the iris, while dilatation is its enervated
  condition.
