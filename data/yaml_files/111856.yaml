revised_title: On the Method of Symmetric Products and Circular Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author, Robert Harley, presents a new method for symmetric products and
  circular functions, focusing on their application to quintic equations. He introduces
  a new cyclical symbol (s') and uses it to simplify expressions and calculate the
  perfect symmetric product for the quintic.
