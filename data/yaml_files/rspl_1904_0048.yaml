revised_title: Investigating the Sparking Distance between Electrically Charged Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the sparking distance between electrically charged surfaces
  using an electric micrometer and finds that the water film on solid surfaces has
  a dielectric strength thirty times greater than air, leading to a sudden increase
  in potential gradient.

- Electric Discharge
- Spark Gap
- Dielectric Strength
- Electric Micrometer
- Potential Gradient
