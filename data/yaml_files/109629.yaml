scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Computational Mathematics
tldr: Thomas Manning presents a new method for computing logarithms that is easy to
  apply and reduces the likelihood of errors. The method involves subtracting numbers
  and can be used for both large and small numbers. It is particularly useful for
  verifying the accuracy of logarithmic tables.
