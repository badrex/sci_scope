revised_title: The Influence of Electrical Conductivity on Echinoderm Egg Fertilization
  and Artificial Parthenogenesis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the electrical conductivity of echinoderm eggs and its
  impact on fertilization and artificial parthenogenesis. The findings suggest that
  changes in the egg's surface permeability play a crucial role in these processes,
  with implications for understanding the mechanisms of development and reproduction
  in these organisms.
