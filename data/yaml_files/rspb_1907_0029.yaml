scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Diving Medicine & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the solubility of air in various fats and its relation
  to caisson disease. The results show that the solubility of oxygen and nitrogen
  in fats is significantly higher than in water, which has implications for understanding
  and treating decompression sickness in divers.
