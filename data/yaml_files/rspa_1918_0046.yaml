revised_title: 'Periodic Irrotational Waves of Finite Height: A General Method'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author presents a general method for analyzing periodic irrotational waves
  of finite height, including the highest possible wave, by extending Michell's analysis
  and using a surface condition. The method allows for the calculation of wave parameters
  and provides a theoretical advantage by not having an undetermined upper limit.
