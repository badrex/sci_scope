revised_title: On the Geometrical Properties of Plane Cubics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The authors investigate the geometrical properties of plane cubics, focusing
  on the Hessian and Cayleyan curves. They explore the relationship between these
  curves and the cubic's inflexions, providing constructions and applications to special
  cubics, such as the equianharmonic cubic.
