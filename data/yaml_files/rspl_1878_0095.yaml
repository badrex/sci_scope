revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Radiation and Heat on Radiometer Movements
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the effects of radiation and heat on radiometer movements,
  discovering that the direction and speed of rotation are influenced by the position
  of screens, the degree of exhaustion, and the temperature of the vanes. The findings
  support the theory that molecular pressure and repulsion play a significant role
  in these phenomena.
