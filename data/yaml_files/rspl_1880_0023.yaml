revised_title: Thermo-Electric Behavior of Aqueous Solutions with Platinum Electrodes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the thermo-electric behavior of aqueous solutions with
  platinum electrodes and compares the results with those obtained using mercurial
  electrodes. The study aims to determine if the currents obtained with mercury are
  due to chemical action and to draw further inferences from the results.
