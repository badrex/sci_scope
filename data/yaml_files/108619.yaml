revised_title: A Study on Caustics and Secondary Caustics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the properties of caustics and secondary caustics in
  the context of reflection and refraction of light. The study covers various scenarios,
  including the case of a reflecting or refracting circle and rays proceeding from
  a point. The author also discusses the secondary caustic as the orthogonal trajectory
  of the reflected or refracted rays and its relation to the reflecting or refracting
  curve.
