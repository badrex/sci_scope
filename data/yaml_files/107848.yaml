revised_title: Magnetic Intensity Changes in Dipping and Horizontal Needles at Treurenburgh
  Bay in Spitsbergen
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author, Captain Henry Foster, investigates the diurnal changes in magnetic
  intensity using dipping and horizontal needles at Treurenburgh Bay in Spitsbergen.
  The results show that the simultaneous changes in the intensities of the two needles
  indicate a change in the general intensity of the Earth's magnetism, which may be
  due to a daily rotatory motion of the polarizing axis of the Earth.
