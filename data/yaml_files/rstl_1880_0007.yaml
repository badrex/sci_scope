scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Nervous System
tldr: The author investigates the locomotor system of medusae, focusing on the physiology
  and histology of their primitive nerve and muscle tissues. The study examines artificial
  rhythm, the effects of varying current intensity, and the persistency of rhythm
  under constant stimulation, providing valuable insights into the functioning of
  these simple organisms.
