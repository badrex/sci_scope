scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of aceto-acetic acid on the estimation of
  creatinine in urine and find that it significantly affects the determination of
  creatine levels. They propose a method to remove aceto-acetic acid from urine to
  improve the accuracy of creatinine measurements.
