  Time
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Stratigraphy
tldr: The author discusses the challenges of measuring geological time and proposes
  a method to estimate the comparative value of different geological ages and formations.
  The author suggests that the Old Red Sandstone, Permian, and New Red series were
  deposited in inland lakes, indicating a continental age. The author also examines
  the Cambrian and Silurian rocks and their deposition in inland waters, providing
  insights into the evolution of species and the measurement of geological time.
