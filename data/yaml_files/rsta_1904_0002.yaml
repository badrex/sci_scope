revised_title: The Influence of Light on the Combination of Hydrogen and Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of light on the combination of hydrogen and
  chlorine, discovering that the initial expansion is proportional to the amount of
  hydrochloric acid formed and the temperature rise. They also find that the expansion
  due to a given quantity of light is independent of the amount of hydrochloric acid
  formed.
