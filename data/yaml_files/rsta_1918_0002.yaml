revised_title: On the Influence of Oceanic Tides on Water-Level Measurements
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the impact of oceanic tides on water-level measurements,
  specifically examining the effects of tidal loading in the North Atlantic on measurements
  taken at Chicago. The study considers the elastic deformation of the Earth's surface
  and the tilting of the ground due to tidal pressure, providing a mathematical analysis
  of the phenomenon.
