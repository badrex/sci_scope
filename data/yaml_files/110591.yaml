revised_title: A Comprehensive Analysis of Astronomical Refractions and Atmospheric
  Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the theory of astronomical refractions, analyzing the
  work of Dominique Cassini, Isaac Newton, and others. They propose a formula for
  refraction and discuss the effects of heat on atmospheric density, ultimately deducing
  equations for the complete solution of the problem of astronomical refractions.
