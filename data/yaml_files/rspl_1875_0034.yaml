revised_title: A New Instrument for Calculating Integrals of Two Given Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: Sir W. Thomson presents a new instrument designed to calculate integrals of
  two given functions, simplifying the process of analyzing functions into their harmonic
  constituents. The instrument has potential applications in tidal harmonic analysis,
  meteorological observations, and other scientific fields.
