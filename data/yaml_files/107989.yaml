scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author, John Muller, discovers four distinct hearts with regular pulsations
  connected to the lymphatic system in certain amphibious animals. These hearts, found
  in frogs, toads, salamanders, and lizards, play a crucial role in directing the
  motion of lymph and are separate from the main circulatory system.
