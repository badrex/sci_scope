revised_title: On the Limit of Vaporization and the Influence of Temperature and Gravity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: Faraday investigates the existence of a limit to vaporization and demonstrates
  that a limit exists for any substance placed in vacuo or in elastic media. The limit
  is determined by the balance between the tension of the vapor and the force of gravity
  acting on it. Temperature plays a crucial role in this process, as it can decrease
  the tension of the vapor, making it fixed at common temperatures.
