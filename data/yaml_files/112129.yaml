revised_title: Generalized Plane Coordinate Geometry through Stigmatics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author introduces the concept of stigmatics, a generalized form of coordinate
  geometry, and demonstrates its application in various mathematical scenarios, including
  coordinate transformation and algebraic geometry. This new approach offers a clearer
  understanding of geometric operations and can be applied to both plane and solid
  geometry.
