revised_title: Experiments on Irish Slat and its Relation to Yellow Ochre and Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Geochemistry
tldr: The author discusses experiments conducted on Irish slat, exploring its vitriolic
  qualities, its relation to yellow ochre, and its magnetic properties. The slat is
  calcined, revealing its transformation into a yellow ochre, and the author hypothesizes
  that the orange-colored sediment found in fountains may originate from this type
  of slat rather than iron ore.
