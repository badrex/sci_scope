tldr: The author describes their experience during the March 8, 1749 earthquake in
  Devonshire Street, London. They observed a series of slow, strong shocks that resembled
  the rocking of a coach. The event caused some structural damage, such as a cracked
  wall and a slightly displaced post. The author also notes that the door between
  two rooms, unlatched during the first earthquake, remained latched during the subsequent
  shocks, suggesting that the house was lifted during the first earthquake but only
  rocked during the later ones.
