revised_title: 'The Homogeneity of Helium and Argon: A Study of Their Diffusion and
  Separation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Elemental Composition
tldr: Ramsay and Collie investigate the homogeneity of helium and argon by examining
  their diffusion and separation. They find that no significant separation occurs,
  suggesting that both elements are single elements and not mixtures of multiple elements.
