revised_title: The Life-History and Development of Spirillum
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors study the life-history of Spirillum, a type of bacteria, and discover
  its complex development process. They observe the alternation between active and
  resting states, the formation of spores, and the role of filaments in the bacteria's
  life cycle. The findings reveal the unspecialized and protean nature of bacterial
  forms and their diverse modes of division.
