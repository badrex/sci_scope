revised_title: 'Chlorine''s Reaction with Methyl: Formation of Chloride of Ethyl'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author investigates the reaction between chlorine and methyl, discovering
  that it forms ethyl chloride. This finding supports the idea that the lowest term
  of the alcohol radical series behaves similarly to its homologues, opening up possibilities
  for synthesizing various compounds from marsh-gas hydrocarbons.
