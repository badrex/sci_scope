revised_title: Investigating the Photographic Action of Alpha Particles Emitted from
  Radioactive Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the photographic action of alpha particles emitted from
  radioactive substances, finding that the density of the film is proportional to
  the amount of silver halide altered by the particles. They also determine the relationship
  between the photographic action and the thickness of aluminum screens, providing
  insights into the behavior of alpha particles in various materials.
