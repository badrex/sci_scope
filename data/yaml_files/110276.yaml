revised_title: The Role of Blood Vessels in Circulation and the Nature of Their Powers
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Circulatory System
tldr: The author, A.P.W. Philip, investigates the sources and nature of the powers
  that maintain the circulation of the blood. He demonstrates that the circulation
  continues unimpeded even when the heart's pumping action ceases and that blood vessels,
  particularly capillaries, play a crucial role in maintaining blood flow. The power
  exerted by blood vessels is linked to the nervous system, and both the heart and
  blood vessels contribute to the circulation, with their power being a muscular one.
