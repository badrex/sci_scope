revised_title: 'A Study of Spectral Series: Part I - Alkalies and Helium'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates spectral series, focusing on the alkalies and helium.
  They analyze the wave-lengths of corresponding spectral lines and discuss the limitations
  of existing formulae in accurately identifying lines within series. The author proposes
  a new formula for the series, which they believe to be more accurate and precise.
topics:
- Spectral Series
- Atomic Spectroscopy
- Sodium Principal Series
- Alkali Metals
- Wave-Lengths
