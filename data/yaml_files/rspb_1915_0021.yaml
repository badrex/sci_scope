revised_title: The Influence of Surface Tension on Cell Metabolism
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the role of surface tension in controlling cell metabolism
  and finds that it influences the action of enzymes, with different parts of the
  cell experiencing varying conditions for enzyme activity. Surface tension affects
  the combination of substrate and enzyme, as well as the chemical reactions taking
  place within the cell, leading to the adaptability of cell metabolism in response
  to changes in the environment.
