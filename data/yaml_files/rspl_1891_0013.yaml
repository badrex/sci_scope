revised_title: 'Hemisection of the Spinal Cord in Monkeys: Sensory Impulses and Motor
  Responses'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of hemisection of the spinal cord in monkeys
  and discovers that sensory disturbances do not correspond to previous observations.
  The study reveals that certain sensory impulses pass mainly up the same side, while
  painful impressions travel up both sides. The findings also show vaso-motor disturbances,
  degenerations, and the origin and course of long and short tract fibers.
