tldr: The author, Captain Sir A. Noble, presents a preliminary note on his ongoing
  research on explosives, focusing on the transformation properties and ballistic
  results of various explosives, including gun-cotton and modern explosives containing
  gun-cotton as a primary ingredient. The research also investigates the erosive power
  of different explosives and the capacity of different materials to resist erosion.
