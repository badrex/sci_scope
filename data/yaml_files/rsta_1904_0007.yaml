revised_title: Investigation of Electricity Discharge from Hot Platinum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the discharge of electricity from hot platinum in various
  gases and pressures, discovering that hot platinum discharges negative electricity
  more readily than positive electricity. They also find that the ions in the discharge
  between hot platinum electrodes immersed in a flame nearly all originate at the
  surface of the platinum.
