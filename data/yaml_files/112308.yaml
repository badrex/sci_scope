  Life
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology
tldr: The author investigates the immunity of the stomach from being digested by its
  own secretion during life. Through a series of experiments, he demonstrates that
  the stomach's ability to resist digestion depends on the balance between the acid
  content and the alkaline circulation. When the acid content is within a certain
  range, the circulation can protect the stomach, but when the acid content is too
  high, the stomach is susceptible to digestive attack.
