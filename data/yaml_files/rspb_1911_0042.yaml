revised_title: The Influence of Animal Extracts on Milk Secretion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Reproduction
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of various animal extracts on milk secretion
  in lactating animals, focusing on extracts from the pituitary gland's posterior
  lobe and corpus luteum. They find that these extracts can stimulate milk production,
  with the posterior lobe extract being more effective. The study contributes to the
  understanding of the endocrine system's role in lactation.
