revised_title: A Reassessment of Lemming Remains Found in Cave-Deposits of England
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mammalogy & Evolution
tldr: The author examines the alleged existence of lemming remains found in cave-deposits
  of England and concludes that the specimens are actually remains of a Pika, or tailless
  Hare, rather than a Lemming. This challenges the previous understanding of the age
  and composition of the cave deposits.
