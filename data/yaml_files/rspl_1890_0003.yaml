  and Electrical Changes

tldr: The author uses a photographic method to determine the time-relations of muscle
  contractions and electrical changes during latent stimulation. The results show
  that the estimated duration of the period of latent stimulation is too long and
  that the electrical response begins at the same time as the mechanical response,
  challenging previous theories on the excitatory process in muscle.
