revised_title: On the Relative Retardation of Light Components in a Crystalline Plate
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relative retardation between the components of a
  light stream when passing through a crystalline plate cut in any direction. The
  study focuses on the transformation of the wavefronts and the determination of the
  relative retardation using biquadratic equations and approximations.
