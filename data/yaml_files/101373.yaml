revised_title: The Nature and Production of White and the Distinctness of Refracted
  Images
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: In this letter, Isaac Newton discusses the number of colors required for the
  production of white and the distinctness of refracted images. He argues that all
  original colors are necessary for creating white and that the distinctness of images
  is due to the density of light at the correct points of focus, despite irregular
  refraction.
