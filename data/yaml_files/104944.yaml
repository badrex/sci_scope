scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: Benjamin Franklin and Peter Collinson describe electrical experiments conducted
  in pursuit of John Canton's work. They discuss principles of electric atmospheres,
  their interactions, and the repelling forces between electrified and non-electrified
  bodies. The authors also detail various experiments involving prime conductors,
  glass tubes, and the transfer of electric atmospheres.
