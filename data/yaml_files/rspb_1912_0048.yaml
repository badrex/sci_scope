tldr: The author investigates the development and infection of Trypanosoma gambiense
  in Glossina palpalis, finding that the crucial factor in infection is the first
  feed of clean blood after the infecting feed. The study also highlights the importance
  of considering individual strain and negative periods when examining the infectivity
  and potential danger of infected animals in fly areas.
