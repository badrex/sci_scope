scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the properties of a concretion from Berne and compares its
  specific gravity to various substances, concluding that it is more similar to petrified
  water and certain minerals than animal concretions. The author also discusses the
  limitations of current hypotheses and suggests further experiments to determine
  the composition of such concretions.
