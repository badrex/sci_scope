  Fluid Dynamics, Torsion, and Flexure'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Numerical Analysis
tldr: The authors present a method for solving Poisson's and Laplace's equations in
  two dimensions, with applications in fluid dynamics, torsion, and flexure problems.
  The method uses graphical and mechanical integration to find source distributions
  and boundary conditions, providing a general approach to solving these types of
  problems.
