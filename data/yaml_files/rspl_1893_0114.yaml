revised_title: 'Submergence of Western Europe and the Mediterranean Coasts: Evidence
  from the Glacial and Neolithic Periods'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author presents evidence of a significant submergence of Western Europe
  and Mediterranean coasts at the end of the Glacial or Post-Glacial Period, which
  occurred just before the Neolithic Period. This submergence resulted in unique drift
  deposits that were distinct from those caused by river, sea, and glacial movements.
