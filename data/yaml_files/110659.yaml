revised_title: Verification of the Amplitude of the Abbe de La Caille's Arc of the
  Meridian
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodetic Astronomy
tldr: Thomas Maclear describes his observations made at the Cape of Good Hope using
  Bradley's Zenith Sector to verify the amplitude of the Abbe de La Caille's Arc of
  the Meridian. He discusses the precautions taken, the different stations used, and
  the reduction of the observations. Although the anomaly of La Caille's arc was not
  fully resolved, Maclear acknowledges the great credit due to the distinguished astronomer
  for his work with limited resources.
