revised_title: Chemical Analysis of Zoophytes and the Nature of Membrane Components
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: Charles Hatchett investigates the chemical composition of various zoophytes
  and membrane components, discovering that their differences lie in the nature and
  quantity of the hardening or ossifying principle and the state of the substance
  with which it is mixed. He also concludes that gelatin and animal fiber are derived
  from the primary animal matter, albumen, which undergoes various modifications to
  form the diverse parts of animal bodies.
