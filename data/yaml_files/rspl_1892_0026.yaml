  at Different Altitudes'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Captain W. de W. Abney's study on the transmission of sunlight through the Earth's
  atmosphere, focusing on light scattering at various altitudes. The research uses
  platino-type paper to record observations and compares the results with spectrum
  measurements. The value of k in the formula for calculating the loss of light intensity
  is determined, and a table is provided showing the transmitted light values at different
  altitudes.
