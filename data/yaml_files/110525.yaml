tldr: The author proposes a new sidereal catalogue with a graphic representation of
  stars visible within the telescope's field of view. The method involves using a
  four-inch aperture telescope attached to a three-foot circle, allowing for accurate
  determination of star positions and the identification of a potential law of position
  in stars.
