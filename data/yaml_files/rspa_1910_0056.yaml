revised_title: The Liberation of Helium from Minerals by the Action of Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The authors investigate the process of helium liberation from minerals using
  heat. They conduct experiments on monazite and thorianite, finding that about half
  of the helium content is released at a red heat. The results provide insight into
  the way helium is retained within minerals.
