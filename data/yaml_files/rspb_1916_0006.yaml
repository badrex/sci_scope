revised_title: Investigating Chemical Temperature Regulation in Anaesthetized Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates chemical temperature regulation in anaesthetized animals,
  specifically cats and rabbits, and finds that the oxygen consumption is directly
  proportional to the extent to which the subcutaneous temperature has fallen below
  a fixed point. The results suggest that the lowered skin temperature triggers muscular
  activity, often in the form of shivering.
