scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The study investigates the effect of an individual's height on the speed of
  nerve impulse transmission. It finds that the speed of the nervous impulse per unit
  length is the same for both tall and short individuals, but the time taken for the
  impulse to travel from the center to the periphery is longer in taller individuals.
