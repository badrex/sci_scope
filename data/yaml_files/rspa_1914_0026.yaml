revised_title: 'On Natural Radiation from a Gas: Deriving a Form of Pulse in Agreement
  with Planck''s Law of Radiation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the form of a pulse in a gas to derive a radiation model
  that aligns with Planck's law of radiation at any temperature. The study aims to
  understand the constitution of natural radiation by decomposing the pulse and its
  relation to molecular structure and energy.
