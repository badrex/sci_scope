revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of the Solar Eclipse of 1900 and the Flash Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics
tldr: The author analyzes the spectroscopic results of the 1900 solar eclipse and
  confirms that the enhanced lines in the flash spectrum are present in every strong
  dark line exceeding Rowland's intensity 7. The study also suggests that the solar
  gases circulate radially, with highly heated ascending gases creating the flash
  spectrum and cooler, diffused gases causing the absorption spectrum.
