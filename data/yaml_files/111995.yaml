tldr: The author, William Huggins, investigates the spectra of various chemical elements
  using a spectroscope. He compares the spectra of terrestrial elements to those of
  fixed stars, employing a standard scale based on the air-spectrum. The study reveals
  new lines in the spectra of potassium, calcium, lithium, and strontium, as well
  as the unexpected discovery of two common lines in the spectra of oxygen and nitrogen.
