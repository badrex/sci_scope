revised_title: Peripheral Distribution of Fibres in Posterior Roots of Spinal Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the peripheral distribution of fibers in the posterior
  roots of spinal nerves using experiments on frogs, cats, and monkeys. The study
  reveals the segmental skin-fields of these nerves and their complex overlaps, providing
  insights into the organization and connectivity of the nervous system.
