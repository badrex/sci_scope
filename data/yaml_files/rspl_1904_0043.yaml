revised_title: A Novel Method for Finding the Area of Plane Figures
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Measurement
tldr: The authors present a radial area-scale, a device that uses a transparency with
  radiating lines to find the area of a plane figure. The figure is placed under the
  transparency, and the intersections of the radiating lines with the figure's contour
  are read and calculated to determine the area. This method can be adjusted for accuracy
  and speed, and can be used for various shapes and sizes of figures.
