revised_title: The Distinction and Interactions of Nutrient Fluids in Invertebrate
  Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author, Thomas Williams, investigates the two distinct nutrient fluids found
  in invertebrate animals, blood-proper and chylo-aqueous fluid, and their respective
  systems. He observes that these fluids coexist in some classes of invertebrates
  but become united in others. Williams also notes that the presence of organized
  corpuscles in the chylo-aqueous fluid is a consistent feature across different classes
  and species, making them significant for species identification.
