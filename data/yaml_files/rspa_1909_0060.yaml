revised_title: Angular Momentum and Wave Motion in a Revolving Shaft and Circularly
  Polarized Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Wave Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the wave motion of a revolving shaft and suggests a
  connection between the angular momentum in a beam of circularly polarized light
  and the motion of a revolving shaft. The study explores the relationship between
  the natural and forced velocities of energy transmission in the shaft and the conditions
  required for a wave system to be considered part of a natural wave system.
