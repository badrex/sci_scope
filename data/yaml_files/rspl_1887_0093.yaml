revised_title: On the Rate of Electricity Leakage through Poor Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena
tldr: This study investigates the rate at which electricity leaks through liquids
  that are poor conductors, using a condenser and electrometer. The authors find that
  paraffin oil shows a slight deviation from Ohm's law, while other liquids tested,
  such as benzene and olive oil, follow the law closely. The conductivity of all tested
  liquids increases with temperature, similar to electrolytes.
