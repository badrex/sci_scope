revised_title: Determination of the Dielectric Constant of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid
  Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors measure the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen and liquid air,
  finding that they possess a high insulating property. They use a small condenser
  with a dielectric made of glass and metal plates to measure the capacity of the
  condenser when the dielectric is gaseous air and when it is replaced by liquid oxygen
  or liquid air. The results show that the dielectric constant of the glass separators
  decreases with low temperature, and the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen is
  close to that of paraffined paper.
