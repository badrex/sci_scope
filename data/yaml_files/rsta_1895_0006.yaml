scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors, Lord Rayleigh and Professor William Ramsay, discover a new gas,
  argon, in the atmosphere. They analyze the density of nitrogen extracted from various
  sources and find that it is slightly lighter than atmospheric nitrogen. This leads
  them to identify argon as a previously unknown constituent of the atmosphere.
