revised_title: Persistence of Phosphorescence in Mercury Vapour
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the phosphorescence of mercury vapour after removing
  the exciting light and discovers that the fluorescence persists for a certain distance
  from the point of excitation. The phenomenon is observed using a quartz tube with
  a moving column of mercury vapour and a beam of 2536 light. The author also discusses
  the differences in fluorescence spectra compared to previous studies.
