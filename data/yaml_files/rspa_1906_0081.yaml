scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: This paper investigates the optical properties of thin metallic plates, focusing
  on the ellipticity and phase difference of light components. The author presents
  convenient formulas for these quantities and compares them with recent experimental
  results, discussing the implications of the findings.
