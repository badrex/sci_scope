revised_title: Investigating the Total Light Received from Stars and the Sun
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The author discusses the composition of total light received from stars and
  the sun, challenging the idea that the sun's light constitutes the main portion
  of the total light. They argue that the light from distant clusters of stars is
  more significant, and that the distance between stars plays a crucial role in the
  amount of light received.
