scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the transformation of rotifer eggs into ciliated infusoria,
  providing evidence for heterogenesis and suggesting that the various forms of organisms
  are outcomes of molecular composition and polarity.
