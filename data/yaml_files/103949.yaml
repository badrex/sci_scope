  Measurements'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: Charles Leigh presents an improved version of Davis's Quadrant, utilizing a
  mercurial level to measure the co-altitude of the sun or stars at sea without relying
  on the sensible horizon. This innovation allows for more accurate latitude determination,
  especially in situations where the horizon is obscured by weather or calm conditions.
