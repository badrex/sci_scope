revised_title: 'Polarization of Light by Reflection: Brewster''s Law'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: David Brewster discovers the relationship between the angle of incidence and
  the angle of refraction for maximum polarization in light reflection. He finds that
  the tangent of incidence is equal to the index of refraction, leading to the complementary
  angles of incidence and refraction or their sum being a right angle.
