revised_title: 'Rate of Emission of α-Particles from Uranium and its Products: A Study
  of Pitchblende'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear Chemistry & Radiochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the rate of emission of α-particles from uranium and
  its products using pitchblende. They employ a zinc sulphide screen and a microscope
  to count scintillations produced by the α-particles. The results show that the rate
  of emission of α-particles from uranium is in fair agreement with previous findings.
