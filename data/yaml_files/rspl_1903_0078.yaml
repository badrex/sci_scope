scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Analysis
tldr: This paper provides rigorous forms of integrals for surface harmonics of orders
  0, 1, 2, and 3, which are essential for practical applications of ellipsoidal harmonic
  analysis. The author corrects a mistake in a previous paper and presents a table
  of these integrals.
