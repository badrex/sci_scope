tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the spectra obtained during total
  solar eclipses in 1900, 1901, and 1905, focusing on the chromosphere and corona.
  The study uses spectroscopes to measure wave-lengths and identify various spectral
  lines, providing valuable insights into the solar atmosphere.
