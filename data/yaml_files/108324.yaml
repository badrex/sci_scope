revised_title: Investigating Barometrical Variations and the Moon's Declination
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Luke Howard examines the relationship between barometrical variations and the
  moon's declination, analyzing data from 1815 to 1841. He finds that the barometer's
  mean height is affected by the moon's position in its orbit, with a noticeable depression
  in the atmosphere during the moon's south declination.
