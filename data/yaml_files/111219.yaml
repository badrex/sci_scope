tldr: The author analyzes magnetic disturbances at St. Helena and the Cape of Good
  Hope, discovering periodical patterns in their occurrence. The study suggests that
  the year 1843 was a period of minimal magnetic activity, while 1848 marked a period
  of maximum activity. The research also indicates that the primary causes of annual
  disturbances are not dependent on local seasons.
