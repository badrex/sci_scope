revised_title: Resolution of the Mercury Green Line and its Zeeman Constituents using
  Quartz Lummer Plates
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the structure of the mercury green line using quartz
  and glass Lummer plates, discovering that the plates resolve the line into multiple
  components. They also develop a precise method for measuring the wave-lengths of
  these components, which they apply to the satellites of the green line.
