revised_title: The Occlusion of Residual Gas by Soda-Glass Vacuum Tube Walls
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the occlusion of residual gas in vacuum tubes, particularly
  focusing on the glass walls. They find that the gas is mainly hydrogen, resulting
  from the electrolysis of water vapor condensed on the tube walls. The gas is driven
  into the glass and held mechanically, with no chemical combination occurring.
