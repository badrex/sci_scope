tldr: The author investigates the effects of red, orange, and yellow solar radiation
  on Daguerreotype plates and discovers that these rays can both destroy and restore
  the plate's sensitivity to photogenic light. The study also reveals the unique photogenic
  actions of these rays and their distinct characters, which are antagonistic to one
  another.
