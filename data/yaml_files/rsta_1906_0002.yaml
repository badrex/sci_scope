revised_title: Magic Squares and the Theory of Partitions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Number Theory
tldr: The author explores the properties of general magic squares and their connection
  to the theory of partitions. They develop a method to investigate these properties
  using linear Diophantine equations and demonstrate the application of this method
  to magic squares of order 3.

- Combinatorial Analysis
- Diophantine Equations
