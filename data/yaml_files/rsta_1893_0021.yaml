revised_title: 'On the Annual and Semi-Annual Seismic Periods: An Investigation into
  Earthquake Frequency'
scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Studies
tldr: The authors investigate the annual and semi-annual seismic periods by analyzing
  earthquake data from various regions. They find a well-marked annual period in most
  districts, with maxima occurring around December or January, and a less pronounced
  semi-annual period. The study suggests that the annual variation in barometric pressure
  may be the cause of the annual seismic period.
