revised_title: Electrical Phenomena in the Leaf of Dionaea muscipula
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the electrical phenomena that occur in the leaf of the
  Venus flytrap plant, Dionaea muscipula, when it is irritated. The study reveals
  that the leaf generates a current when its sensitive hairs are touched, and this
  current can be influenced by the direction of the current through the petiole. The
  findings provide insight into the plant's sensory and electrophysiological systems.
