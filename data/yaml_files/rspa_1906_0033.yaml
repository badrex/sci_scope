revised_title: Ionic Size in Relation to the Physical Properties of Aqueous Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between ionic size and the physical
  properties of aqueous solutions, such as conductivity, viscosity, and osmotic pressure.
  They propose a method for analyzing the effects of ionization, viscosity, and water
  combination on the conductivity of electrolytes and test their hypothesis using
  various experimental determinations.
topics:
- Ionic size
- Electrolytes
- Conductivity
- Viscosity
- Hydration
