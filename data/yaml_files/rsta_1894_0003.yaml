scientific_subdiscipline: Biostatistics & Mathematical Biology
tldr: The author discusses the dissection of asymmetrical frequency-curves and the
  investigation of an abnormal curve representing measurements of national numbers.
  The paper focuses on understanding the mathematical theory of evolution and the
  importance of dissection into two normal curves to determine the amount and direction
  of deviation from the mean.
