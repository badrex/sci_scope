revised_title: Investigating the Electric Discharge and Terminal Polarization with
  the Chloride of Silver Battery
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the electric discharge and terminal polarization using
  the chloride of silver battery. They find that there is no significant chemical
  polarization of the terminals, and the deviations observed are due to other factors
  such as static charge.
topics:
- Electric Discharge
- Chloride of Silver Battery
- Terminal Polarization
- Voltameter
- Condenser
