revised_title: Polarization of Light by Crystals of Iodine
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the polarization of light by crystals of iodine and
  discovers that the reflected light is polarized, with the plane of polarization
  bearing a definite relation to a fixed direction within the crystals. The transmitted
  light is also polarized, with the plane of polarization perpendicular to the reflected
  light. The study reveals two forms of iodine, one with a crystalline arrangement
  and another with multiple layers of thin crystals.
