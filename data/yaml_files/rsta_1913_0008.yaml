revised_title: Investigating the Apparent Change in Weight During Chemical Reactions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Techniques
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to investigate the apparent change in weight
  during chemical reactions, using a balance and various reactions. They discuss the
  methods and precautions taken, as well as the results and their implications on
  Landolt's work.
