revised_title: Experimental Demonstration of River Windings and Water Flow in Bends
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & River Dynamics
tldr: The author constructs a small artificial river to test hydrokinetic principles
  and demonstrates the mode of water flow around bends. The experiment uses threads
  and granules to visualize the flow and accumulation of detritus, providing insights
  into the origin of river windings in alluvial plains.
