revised_title: 'Fractional Withdrawal of Complement and Amboceptor by Antigen: A Study
  of Their Relationship'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Molecular Biology
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between complement and amboceptor when
  partially withdrawn by subminimal amounts of antigen. The results show that these
  two substances are removed in the proportion in which they naturally exist in the
  serum, and the liquid remaining after partial withdrawal is comparable to diluted
  normal serum.
