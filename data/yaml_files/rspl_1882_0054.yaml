revised_title: The Embryological Development and Mesoblast Origin in Peripatus Capensis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The authors investigate the embryological development of Peripatus Capensis,
  focusing on the existence of a blastopore and the origin of the mesoblast. They
  provide evidence that the mesoblast originates as a series of paired outgrowths
  from the hypoblast, near the junction of the hypoblast with the epiblast at the
  lips of the blastopore. This discovery has significant implications for understanding
  the morphology and development of various organisms.
