revised_title: 'Directed Emission and Reception of Electric Waves: Methods to Confining
  Radiation to Certain Directions'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author investigates methods to confine the radiation of electric waves to
  certain directions and restrict the receptivity of a receiver to electric waves
  emanating from specific directions. The study focuses on horizontal conductors and
  their ability to receive signals with maximum efficiency when aligned with the transmitter's
  vertical plane.
