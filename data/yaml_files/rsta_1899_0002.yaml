revised_title: 'Researches in Vortex Motion: Part III - On Spiral or Gyrostatic Vortex
  Aggregates'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the properties of spiral and gyrostatic vortex aggregates,
  discovering a new system of spiral vortices and exploring their properties and behavior.
  The study focuses on the conditions for the existence of these systems and their
  interactions with surrounding fluids.
topics:
- Vortex Motion
- Gyrostatic Aggregates
- Spiral Vortices
- Vortex Theory
- Vortex Dynamics
