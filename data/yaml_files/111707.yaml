revised_title: 'Nitrogen Substitution in Anthranilic Acid: A New Compound and Its
  Properties'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Isomerism
tldr: The author discovers a new compound formed by substituting nitrogen for hydrogen
  in anthranilic acid. The compound is soluble in water and has unique properties,
  including the release of nitrogen when heated with water and the transformation
  into salicylic acid. The author also discusses the isomerism exhibited by the derivatives
  of phenylamine and the different atomicity of nitrogen under various conditions.
