scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author presents a series of lectures on muscular motion, focusing on the
  involuntary muscles, particularly the heart. They propose a mechanism for the heart's
  contraction and dilation, suggesting that the heart is a compound muscle with internal
  antagonists and that the nervous aether plays a role in its function.
