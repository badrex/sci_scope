scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the exact location of the visual area in the human cerebral
  cortex through histological examination. The study reveals that the visual area
  is a well-defined cortical area located in the calcarine fissure and surrounding
  regions, and its distribution is affected by conditions such as optic atrophy and
  anophthalmos.
