revised_title: 'Bakerian Lecture: The Spark Spectra Series Lines and Their Relation
  to Hydrogen and Helium'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic Physics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates series lines in spark spectra, specifically in magnesium
  and helium, and concludes that the lines are not due to hydrogen but to helium,
  supporting Bohr's theoretical predictions and suggesting that they may be designated
  as 'proto-helium' lines.

- Spark Spectra
- Series Lines
- Helium Spectra
- Magnesium Spectra
- Bohr's Atomic Theory
