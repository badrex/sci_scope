revised_title: The Role of Silica in Cereal Nutrition
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Agronomy
tldr: This study investigates the function of silica in the nutrition of cereals and
  its effects on plant growth. Field experiments at Rothamsted show that the presence
  of soluble silicates in the soil can improve crop yield and grain formation, suggesting
  a potential role for silica in plant nutrition. The researchers also find that the
  action of silica may be related to that of phosphoric acid, as both seem to promote
  grain formation and ripening in barley plants.
