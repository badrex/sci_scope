revised_title: 'Extrusion Granules in Trypanosomes: A Vital Phenomenon'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathology
tldr: The authors observe a phenomenon where trypanosomes extrude granules from their
  bodies, which are then capable of independent movement in the blood. This process
  is believed to be related to the periodic disappearance of trypanosomes from the
  circulating blood and is considered a vital, rather than degenerative, occurrence.
