scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Studies
tldr: The author investigates the correlation between the variations in size of four
  organs in the common shrimp (Crangon vulgaris) using Galton's method. The study
  aims to determine the degree of interdependence between these organs and their deviations
  from the average size. The findings reveal a constant ratio between the mean deviations
  of the organs, indicating a correlation between their variations.
