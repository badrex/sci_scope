scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author presents a new instrument to measure Poisson's ratio directly, improving
  upon previous methods. The experiments involve testing various materials, including
  iron, steel, and cast steel, under different conditions. The results provide a more
  accurate estimation of Poisson's ratio, contributing to the understanding of material
  properties and their behavior under stress.
