tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the effects of an electric current
  on itself under certain circumstances, leading to increased intensity. He demonstrates
  that the intensity of the current is highly exalted when it traverses a considerable
  length of a good conductor, such as a long wire, coiled in the form of a helix,
  and further augmented when the helix is coiled around a cylinder of soft iron, constituting
  an electro-magnet. Faraday refers these phenomena to an inductive action of the
  current, analogous or identical to that described in the First Series of his Experimental
  Researches.
