revised_title: On the Dichroic Properties of Absorbing Polarized Light in Crystals
  with Two Axes of Double Refraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the absorption of polarized light by doubly refracting
  crystals, specifically focusing on the dichroic properties of crystals with two
  axes of double refraction. The study reveals that the quantity of light absorbed
  varies depending on the position of the incident ray relative to the crystal's axes,
  providing insight into the optical properties of these materials.
