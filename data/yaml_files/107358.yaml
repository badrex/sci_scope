revised_title: On the Depolarization of Light by Soft Transparent Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on soft transparent substances,
  discovering that they can form two oppositely polarized images and exhibit complementary
  colors when viewed through polarized light. This phenomenon is demonstrated using
  animal jellies and can lead to further research on other soft substances, fluids,
  and materials in various states.
