revised_title: The Influence of Temperature on the Absorption of Water by Seeds of
  Hordeum Vulgare and its Relation to the Temperature Coefficient of Chemical Change

scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Science & Botany
tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the absorption of water
  by Hordeum vulgar seeds and its relation to the temperature coefficient of chemical
  change. The results show that the velocity of water absorption is an exponential
  function of temperature, and the temperature coefficient is high, similar to that
  of many chemical reactions in solution. The findings suggest that the activity of
  water, particularly the simple 'hydrone' molecules, plays a significant role in
  chemical interactions.
