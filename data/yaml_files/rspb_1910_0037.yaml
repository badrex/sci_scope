  on Assimilation in the Open Air'

scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the rate of carbon dioxide assimilation by leaves of
  Helianthus annuus in bright sunshine using the half-leaf dry-weight method. They
  find that detached leaves can achieve a high rate of assimilation, and discuss the
  role of stomata in regulating the rate of assimilation and translocation of photosynthesis
  products during the day.
