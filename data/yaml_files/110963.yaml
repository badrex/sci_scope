tldr: J. Higginbottom's research identifies two species of British tritons, Triton
  verrucosus and Lisso-triton punctatus. The tritons take three years to reproduce
  and four years to reach full growth. They live in water as tadpoles before moving
  to land, where they are active during summer and hibernate in winter. Reproduction
  occurs in water, and temperature significantly affects growth and limb regeneration.
