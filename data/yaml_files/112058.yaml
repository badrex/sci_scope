scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteoritics & Planetary Science
tldr: The author examines the microstructure of meteorites and their similarities
  to volcanic rocks, providing evidence for the melting and subsequent solidification
  of meteorite material. The study also highlights the presence of glass-cavities
  and gas-cavities in olivine, suggesting the influence of gases or vapors in their
  formation.
