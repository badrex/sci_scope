revised_title: 'Atmospheric Stirring and Precipitation: A Theoretical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between atmospheric stirring and precipitation,
  developing a theoretical framework to calculate the eddy-diffusivity and vertical
  flux of mass, temperature, and momentum in the atmosphere. They propose a new coefficient
  to quantify the effect of eddy motions on the transport of mass and other properties
  in the atmosphere.
