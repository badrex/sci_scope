scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author conducts experiments on gunpowder to determine the most advantageous
  vent position in firearms and measure bullet velocities. He also develops a new
  method for determining projectile velocities and describes an accurate eprouvette
  for gunpowder testing. The experiments were conducted using various apparatus and
  a pendulum to measure bullet velocities.
