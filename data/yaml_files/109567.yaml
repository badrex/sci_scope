  Performance
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Instrumentation
tldr: This paper discusses observations of the transit of Mercury and investigates
  the causes that often prevent the proper functioning of mirrors. The author, William
  Herschel, concludes that uniform temperature and moisture in the atmosphere are
  essential for clear vision through telescopes, and that changes in temperature and
  wind can negatively impact their performance.
