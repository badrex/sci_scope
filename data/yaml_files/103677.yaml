tldr: The author presents an engine designed by Reverend J.T. Desaguliers to remove
  damps and foul air from mines. The engine consists of a triple crank working three
  pumps that can both suck and force air, making it suitable for various air conditions
  in mines. The device can improve mine safety by providing fresh air to workers and
  preventing the extinction of candles used for lighting.
