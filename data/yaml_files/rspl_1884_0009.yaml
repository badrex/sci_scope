revised_title: Investigating the Reflective Properties of Silver Films and Metallic
  Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the reflective properties of silver films and metallic
  surfaces using polarized light. They find that the calculated and observed intensities
  of reflected light differ, particularly for light polarized perpendicularly to the
  plane of incidence. The author also observes that thicker silver films have a higher
  percentage of light reflected.
