  of Pressure

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the compressibility of various gases at pressures between
  one atmosphere and half an atmosphere. The author presents a new apparatus and methodology
  for measuring gas compressibility, which eliminates the need for preliminary gauging
  and provides more accurate results. The results show that some gases, such as nitrous
  oxide and carbonic oxide, have compressibilities that deviate from Boyle's Law,
  while others, like air, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, follow the law more closely.
