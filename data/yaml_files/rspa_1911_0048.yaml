revised_title: Experiments on the Compression of Liquids at High Pressures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on the compression of liquids at high pressures,
  reaching up to 40 tons per square inch, and investigate the effects of friction
  and internal molecular forces on their compressibility. They develop methods to
  eliminate errors and provide insights into the behavior of liquids under extreme
  conditions.
