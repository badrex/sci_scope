tldr: In 1825, J.F.W. Herschel and Capt. Sabine conducted a series of observations
  to determine the difference in meridians between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich
  and Paris. They used a combination of signals, chronometers, and triangulation methods
  to establish a connection between the two observatories, aiming to avoid misunderstandings
  and delays in the transmission of observations.
