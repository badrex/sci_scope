revised_title: A Further Investigation of the Capillary Tube Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the theory of the capillary tube, focusing on the determination
  of surface tension by the rise of the liquid in capillary tubes. The study provides
  a more accurate approximation for the two extreme cases of narrow and wide tubes,
  improving upon previous work by Poisson and Mathieu.
