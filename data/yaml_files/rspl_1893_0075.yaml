revised_title: The Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: This study investigates the effects of stretching, twisting, drawing, heating,
  and hammering on the electrical resistance and density of metals, specifically copper
  and a manganese-copper alloy. The results show that stretching and drawing decrease
  density, while twisting and hammering increase it. The electrical resistance of
  metals is also affected by these mechanical stresses, with varying degrees of change
  depending on the type of stress and metal being tested.
