revised_title: The Magnetic Properties of Iron Shielded from Earth's Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of iron when shielded from the
  Earth's magnetism, discovering that the permeability at low forces increases significantly
  compared to when the specimen is exposed to the Earth's magnetic field. The study
  also shows the effect of resting the specimen in various magnetized states on its
  permeability.
