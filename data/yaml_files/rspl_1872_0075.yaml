revised_title: Mathematical Expression of Complex Periodical Phenomena and Planetary
  Influence on Earth's Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Modeling
tldr: The authors propose a mathematical method to express complex periodical phenomena
  and determine the impact of planetary influences on Earth's magnetism. They apply
  this method to a specific case, investigating the relationship between wind and
  barometric pressure at Bombay.
