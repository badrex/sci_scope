  Helena and Sumatra
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: John Macdonald's observations of the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle
  in St. Helena and Sumatra provide insights into the behavior of the magnetic needle
  and its potential applications in navigation. The study confirms previous inferences
  and suggests further research in various locations to better understand the science
  of magnetism.
