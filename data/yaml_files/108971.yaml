revised_title: Investigation of the Reaction between Hydric Peroxide and Hydric Iodide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Reaction Kinetics
tldr: The authors study the reaction between hydric peroxide and hydric iodide, using
  a precise experimental setup to measure the reaction's conditions and amount. They
  observe the reaction's progression and the moment when iodine is liberated, providing
  insights into the reaction's complexity and the role of hydric peroxide and hydric
  iodide in the process.
