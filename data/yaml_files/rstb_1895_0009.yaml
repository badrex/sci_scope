scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of Heliopora coerulea, an isolated
  Alcyonarian, and provides a detailed analysis of its soft tissues, polyps, coenenchymal
  caeca, and calcareous structures. The study reveals that the ectoderm forms the
  outer layer of the corallum, and the calcareous tissue is deposited by calicoblasts,
  which are not mesodermic cells.
