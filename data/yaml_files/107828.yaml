revised_title: Investigations into the Figure of the Earth and the Ellipticity of
  Gravity
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author investigates the discrepancies between the ellipticity of the Earth,
  as deduced from pendulum experiments and geodetic measures. The study aims to improve
  the mathematical theory connecting the Earth's figure with the variation of gravity
  on its surface and determine the exact figure of the Earth using experimental data.
