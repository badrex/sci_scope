tldr: Rev. Mr. William Hirst observes the transit of Venus over the Sun on June 6,
  1761, in Madrass, using a reflector telescope. The observation is made at Fort St.
  George, and Hirst notes a penumbra or dusky shade around Venus during the event.
  The total ingress and egress times are recorded with precision, and Hirst also notes
  an odd phenomenon where Venus appears as a pear-shaped image during the transit.
