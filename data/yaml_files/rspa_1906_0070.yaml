revised_title: The Mechanism of Positive Ionization Produced by Hot Platinum in Different
  Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the ionization produced by hot platinum in various gases,
  focusing on the mechanism of positive ionization. The study reveals that the positive
  ionization is caused by the gas adsorbed by the metal and is influenced by the external
  pressure and temperature. The findings provide insights into the processes by which
  positive and negative ions are produced.
