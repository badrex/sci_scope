  Application to Dilute Carbonate Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Equilibrium
tldr: The author presents general equations for the neutralisation of dibasic acids
  and their application to dilute carbonate solutions. These equations help determine
  the acidity of dilute carbonate solutions and provide a better understanding of
  the neutralisation process.
