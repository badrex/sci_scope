revised_title: 'Exterior Ballistics: Error of the Day and Corrections to Naval Range
  Tables'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author presents a method for calculating corrections to naval range tables
  for different air densities and muzzle velocities, and discusses the design of a
  simple gun sight system that automatically corrects for various errors, including
  the 'error of the day'.
