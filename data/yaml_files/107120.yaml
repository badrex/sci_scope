  and Pallas'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Science
tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the size and physical construction
  of the recently discovered celestial bodies Ceres and Pallas using a 7-feet reflector
  telescope and a 10-feet reflector telescope. He compares their magnitudes and diameters
  to a lucid disk, concluding that both objects appear smaller than previously estimated.
  The author suggests that the true diameters of Ceres and Pallas are 16.6 miles and
  14.7 miles, respectively.
