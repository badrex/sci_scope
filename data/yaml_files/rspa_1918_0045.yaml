revised_title: Electrical Resolution and Broadening of Helium Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical resolution and broadening of helium lines
  using a spectrograph and a vacuum tube. They observe that certain effects in helium
  are in qualitative agreement with the hypothesis that the broadening is due to the
  electric field of neighboring charged particles on the radiating atom.
