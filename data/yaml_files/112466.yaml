revised_title: Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight at Kew and Para
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric & Environmental Chemistry
tldr: The author, Henry E. Roscoe, investigates the chemical intensity of daylight
  at Kew Observatory and Para, finding that the chemical intensity varies with the
  changing seasons and is much higher in the tropics. He also debunks the idea that
  photographers face difficulties in the tropics due to a decrease in sunlight's chemical
  intensity.
