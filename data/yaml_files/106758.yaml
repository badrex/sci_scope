revised_title: Experiments on the Imbibition of Air by Metals and the Production of
  Calxes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Analysis
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine what happens to air during the
  process of metal ignition in dephlogisticated air. He discovers that the iron gains
  weight and absorbs air, forming a calx saturated with pure air. This calx can be
  revived by introducing inflammable air, leading to new chemical reactions and the
  production of metal calxes.
