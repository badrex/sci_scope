revised_title: The Function and Structure of Dischidia Rafflesiana Pitcher-Roots
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors study the function and structure of Dischidia Rafflesiana pitcher-roots,
  discovering that they absorb nutrients from solids, such as ants and earth, rather
  than just serving as water reservoirs. They also describe the unique features of
  the roots, such as the early cuticularization of root-hairs and the dorsi-ventral
  structure of climbing roots.
