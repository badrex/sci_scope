revised_title: Analytical Researches on Steiner's Extension of Malfatti's Problem
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates Steiner's extension of Malfatti's problem, which involves
  describing three sections of a surface of the second order that touch each other
  and two given sections of the same surface. The article provides an analytical approach
  to solving this geometric problem, using coordinates and equations to determine
  the required sections.
