revised_title: 'Thermal Radiation in Absolute Measure: Further Experiments on the
  Loss of Heat in Vacuum from Metallic Surfaces'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This paper presents further experiments on the loss of heat in vacuum from metallic
  surfaces, focusing on the radiation emitted by platinum wires with different surface
  treatments. The authors investigate the effect of surface texture on the amount
  and quality of radiation, contributing to the understanding of thermal radiation
  in absolute measure.
topics:
- Thermal radiation
