revised_title: 'The Diffusion of Ions into Gases: Experimental Determination of Coefficients
  and Charge on Ions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the diffusion of ions into gases using Rontgen rays
  and finds that the charge on ions produced by Rontgen rays is the same for different
  gases, equal to the charge on a hydrogen ion in a liquid electrolyte. The coefficients
  of diffusion for ions in various gases are determined, and the ratio of the coefficients
  is shown to be equal to the ratio of the velocities of the ions.
