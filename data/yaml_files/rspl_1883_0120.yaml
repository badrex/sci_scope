revised_title: Magnetic Polarity and Neutrality in Iron and Steel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic polarity and neutrality in iron and steel,
  using a magnetic balance and various experimental methods. The research reveals
  that magnetism in iron and steel is due to the inherent polarity of its molecules,
  and that neutrality occurs through a balancing of polar forces. The findings challenge
  the understanding of permanent magnets and the role of neutrality in magnetism.
