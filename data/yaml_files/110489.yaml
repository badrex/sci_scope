revised_title: Artificial Shell-Like Substance Formation and Optical Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Nanotechnology
tldr: Leonard Horner investigates an artificial substance resembling shell and discovers
  it is composed of carbonate of lime and animal matter. The substance exhibits similar
  properties to shell, such as a foliated structure and iridescent appearance. Sir
  David Brewster examines the mechanical and optical properties of the substance,
  finding it has a rhombohedral system and can refract light doubly, similar to calcareous
  spar and mother-of-pearl.
