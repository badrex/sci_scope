revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Fossilized Shells and Stones
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author, Agostino Scilla, investigates the formation of fossilized shells
  and stones found on Earth, proposing that they were once real coverings of enclosed
  marine life and arguing against the idea that they were formed by a vegetative virtue
  in the soil. He provides evidence from various sources, including the geological
  makeup of Malta and the jawbones of certain fish species, to support his claims.
