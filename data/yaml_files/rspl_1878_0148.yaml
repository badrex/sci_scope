revised_title: 'The Contact Theory of Voltaic Action: Experiments on Contact Differences
  of Potential'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Techniques
tldr: The authors, Ayrton and Perry, investigate the contact differences of potential
  in various substances, including metals and liquids, using a new experimental method.
  They find that the contact difference of potentials between liquids can be significant
  and that their method allows for accurate measurement of these differences.

- Electrochemistry
- Galvanic Cells
- Contact Theory
- Electromotive Force
- Measurement Techniques
