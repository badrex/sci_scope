revised_title: Potential of an Anchor Ring and Residues of Powers of Numbers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the potential of an anchor ring and the residues of
  powers of numbers. They derive equations for the potential and discuss various cases
  of motion of the ring. Additionally, they explore the properties of real and complex
  numbers in relation to residues.
