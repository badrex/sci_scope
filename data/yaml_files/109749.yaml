tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the motion of plant tendrils and their response
  to light and external stimuli. He observes that tendrils move towards darkness and
  are attracted to dark objects, while repelled by light. The study provides insights
  into plant adaptation and the role of light perception in plant growth.
