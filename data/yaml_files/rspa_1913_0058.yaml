scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Ceramics
tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of claywares and their origin.
  It demonstrates that the magnetic properties of claywares are due to the presence
  of black unfused grains of unchanged magnetic minerals and bluish-black fused globules
  of ferruginous silicates. The author also discusses the different types of claywares
  and their magnetic properties, as well as the origin of the magnetic materials in
  claywares.
