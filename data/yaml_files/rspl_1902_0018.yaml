revised_title: Investigating the Similarities between Radiation and Mechanical Strains
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author explores the similarities between the effects of radiation and mechanical
  strains on substances, demonstrating that both cause conductivity and electromotive
  variations. The study reveals that the response to these stimuli can be either zincoid
  or cuproid, depending on the substance, and that self-recovery and irreversible
  molecular effects are observed in both cases.
