tldr: The authors present a preliminary investigation and theoretical analysis of
  dynamo-electric machines, focusing on the relation between magnetic fields and magnetizing
  forces. They develop a method to construct the characteristic curve of a dynamo
  and discuss the effects of current in the armature and the lead of the brushes on
  the machine's performance.
