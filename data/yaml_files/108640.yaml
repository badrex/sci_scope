  an Equation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, investigates the conditions for the existence of
  equalities among the roots of an equation, focusing on symmetric functions, invariants,
  and covariants. The study covers both quartic and quintic equations, providing tables
  to help understand the relationships between the roots and the conditions for various
  systems of equalities.
