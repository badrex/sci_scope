revised_title: 'Investigation of Compass Deviations in Ships: The Role of Polar-Magnet-Force
  and Quadrantal Deviation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: 'The author examines compass deviations in both wood-built and iron-built ships,
  identifying two primary causes: polar-magnet-force and quadrantal deviation. The
  former is due to the transient induced magnetism of iron, while the latter is a
  result of the ship''s orientation and can be corrected by strategically placing
  additional iron masses.'
