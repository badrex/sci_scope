revised_title: Temperature and Time Effects on Dielectric Capacity and Residual Charge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of temperature and time on the capacity
  and residual charge of dielectrics, using glass and ice as primary materials. They
  find that residual charge in glass increases with temperature, while the capacity
  of ice for short times is about 80 and decreases for even shorter times.
topics:
- Dielectrics
- Temperature Effects
- Residual Charge
- Electromotive Force
- Capacity
