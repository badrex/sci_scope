tldr: The author, Peter Griess, investigates a new series of nitrogen-substituted
  compounds, specifically diazobenzol, and its various reactions and properties. These
  compounds are notable for their instability, but also for the variety of stable
  compounds they can form. The author also describes the explosive nature of nitrate
  of diazobenzol and its potential dangers.
