revised_title: 'On the Specific Heats of Gases at Constant Volume: A Preliminary Note'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: Joly investigates the specific heat of gases at constant volume using a steam
  calorimeter and finds that the specific heat of air at constant volume is higher
  than theoretically predicted. The results suggest that the specific heat of a gas
  at constant volume is independent of pressure.

- Calorimetry
- Specific Heat
- Gas Thermodynamics
- Air Properties
- Pressure and Density
