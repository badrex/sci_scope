scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the morphological changes in the oocyte of Antedon,
  focusing on the cell-metabolism and the role of various cell structures. The research
  examines the growth and form of the germinal vesicle, chromatin, nucleolus, yolk
  nucleus, and yolk formation, providing insights into the factors influencing these
  processes.
