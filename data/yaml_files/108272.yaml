revised_title: Elliptic Polarization of Light by Reflexion from Metallic Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the elliptic polarization of light by reflection from
  metallic surfaces, exploring the changes in ellipticity, the virtual plane of polarization,
  and the restoration of plane polarization using Fresnel's rhomb. The study provides
  insights into the laws governing metallic reflection and the application of the
  undulatory theory.
