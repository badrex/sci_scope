revised_title: On the Movements and Photographic Analysis of Detonation Waves in Gas
  Explosions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author, along with E. H. Strange and E. Graham, examines the movements and
  photographic analysis of detonation waves in gas explosions. They find that the
  temperature of the gas appears to increase abruptly, and the luminosity of the gas
  remains for some time after the wave has passed. The detonation wave's velocity
  is compared to the velocity of sound in gases, providing an approximation of the
  temperature.
