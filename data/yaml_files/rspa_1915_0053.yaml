revised_title: Deep-Sea Water Waves Caused by Local Disturbance on or beneath the
  Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates deep-sea water waves caused by local disturbances on
  or beneath the surface, focusing on the oscillations at the center of the disturbance.
  The study uses Fourier's double integral theorem and Bessel's functions to analyze
  the wave propagation and the effect of the initial disturbance's breadth on the
  waves.
