revised_title: The Nature of Hydrolytic Processes in Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors criticize the ionic dissociation hypothesis and emphasize the importance
  of considering the solvent's role in hydrolytic processes. They argue that the law
  of mass action is not applicable to solutions and that the molecular weight determination
  methods may be misleading due to the influence of the solvent.
