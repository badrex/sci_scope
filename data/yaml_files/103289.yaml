tldr: Antony van Leeuwenhoek examines the internal structure of diamonds using a microscope
  and observes streaks or fibers in the stones. He concludes that these features are
  likely due to the coagulation and growth of the diamonds over time, similar to the
  process of crystal formation in other minerals.
