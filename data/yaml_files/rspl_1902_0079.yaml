revised_title: Anomalies in Lithium Spectrum Lines
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the flame and arc spectra of lithium, discovering significant
  differences in the wave-lengths of some lines compared to the arc spectrum. The
  study reveals that the blue line in the flame spectrum is broader and more complex
  than previously thought, with multiple components and variations in intensity.
