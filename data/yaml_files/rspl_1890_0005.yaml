revised_title: 'Ternary Alloys: The Effects of Temperature and Proportions on Metal
  Solubility'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of temperature and proportions on the solubility
  of metals in ternary alloys. They find that the solubility of metals in alloys is
  affected by the temperature and the proportions of the metals present, leading to
  the formation of two different ternary alloys of unequal density.
