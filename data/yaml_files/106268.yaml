revised_title: A New Method for Finding Time by Equal Altitudes
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Positional Astronomy
tldr: The author presents a new method for finding time using equal altitudes of stars,
  which allows for more accurate observations and reduces the impact of environmental
  factors. This method involves selecting a star with a polar distance close to the
  complement of the observer's latitude and using an astronomical quadrant to measure
  the star's altitude in vertical circles.
