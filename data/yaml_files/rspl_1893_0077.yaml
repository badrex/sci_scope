revised_title: Hepatic Glycogenesis and the Influence of Various Factors on Hepatic
  Amylolysis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: This study investigates the process of hepatic glycogenesis and the factors
  affecting hepatic amylolysis. The research demonstrates that the rapid early conversion
  of glycogen to glucose is inhibited when the structure of liver cells is destroyed,
  suggesting that the process is dependent on living liver cells. The study also examines
  the effects of various factors, such as temperature, sodium fluoride, chloroform,
  and ether, on the conversion of glycogen to glucose and the structural changes in
  liver cells.
