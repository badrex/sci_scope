scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the causes of experimental fever, specifically focusing
  on the role of water contamination and the presence of a heat-stable fever-producing
  body. They find that contamination by this body, rather than bacterial infection,
  is a more significant factor in salvarsan fever and other types of fever resulting
  from injection of various substances dissolved or suspended in water.
