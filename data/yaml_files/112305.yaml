tldr: The author describes the construction and capabilities of a large spectroscope
  with nine prisms and achromatic telescopes, which allows for precise analysis of
  light spectra from various sources. The instrument is used to study the differences
  between the spectra of thallium, strontium, and lithium under different conditions,
  and to resolve discrepancies in the positioning of spectral lines.
