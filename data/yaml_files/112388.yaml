revised_title: Investigating the Induction of Electric Currents by Magnetism and Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author demonstrates a relationship between electric currents, magnetism,
  and heat using a coil of insulated copper wire, a permanent magnet, and an iron
  wire. By heating the iron wire, the author observes induced electric currents in
  the coil, confirming a connection between heat and magnetism.
