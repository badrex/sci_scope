revised_title: Temperature Effects on Refractive Index and Dispersive Power of Expansible
  Fluids in Telescopes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the effect of temperature on the refractive index
  and dispersive power of expansible fluids in telescopes. He finds that the distance
  of the object-glass requires a minute adjustment due to temperature changes and
  that the dispersive ratio remains constant at all temperatures.
