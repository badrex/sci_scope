revised_title: The Complete Photo-electric Emission from the Alloy of Sodium and Potassium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the complete photo-electric emission from an alloy of
  sodium and potassium, confirming that the same law governs the variation of its
  complete photo-electric emission with the temperature of the source of radiation.
  The findings support the use of thermodynamic considerations in understanding the
  photo-electric effect.
