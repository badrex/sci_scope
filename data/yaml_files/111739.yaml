revised_title: The Influence of Angular Aperture and Oblique Light on Microscope Penetrating
  Power and Object Distinctness
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the angular aperture of object-glasses
  in compound microscopes and their ability to penetrate and display distinct images
  of transparent objects under oblique light. The study reveals that an increased
  angular aperture and oblique light enhance the visibility of delicate markings on
  transparent objects, while also affecting the overall distinctness of the image.
