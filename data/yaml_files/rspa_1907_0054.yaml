revised_title: The Origin of Gases Evolved by Mineral Springs
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the gases evolved by mineral springs and finds a resemblance
  between the gases of mineral springs and the gases of rocks. They suggest that the
  disintegration and partial solution of ordinary rocks by water at a high temperature
  account for the gaseous and solid products delivered by springs.
