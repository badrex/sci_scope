revised_title: The Constitution of the Copper-Tin Series of Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the constitution of copper-tin alloys through a study
  of their cooling curves and microstructure. They find that the alloys undergo complex
  transformations during solidification, and their findings contribute to a better
  understanding of the properties and behavior of these materials.
