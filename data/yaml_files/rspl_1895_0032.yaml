revised_title: Experimental Degenerations Following Unilateral Lesions of the Cortex
  Cerebri in the Bonnet Monkey
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The study investigates the degeneration resulting from minute lesions of the
  motor area of the cortex cerebri in the bonnet monkey. The researchers trace the
  degeneration through the brain and spinal cord, locating the path of conducting
  fibers and their destinations. The findings provide insights into the neural pathways
  and connections involved in motor function and the effects of brain injuries.
