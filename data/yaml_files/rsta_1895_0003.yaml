revised_title: Investigation of Magnetization Propagation in Iron and its Relation
  to Electric Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the propagation of magnetization in iron and its relation
  to electric currents. They use a custom-built electromagnet and various exploring
  coils to measure the changes in magnetization at different depths and times after
  the reversal of the electric current. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of magnetization in iron and contribute to the understanding of electromagnetism.
