revised_title: Observations on the Movement of the Glass Case of a Radiometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Optics
tldr: William Crookes investigates the movement of the glass case of a radiometer
  when exposed to radiation from candles and a magnet. He observes that the glass
  case rotates in the opposite direction when a magnet is brought near, and discusses
  the internal friction affecting the movement. This study contributes to the understanding
  of the underlying mechanisms of radiometers and their response to external forces.
