revised_title: Researches on the Specific Rotation and Changes in Lactin
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the specific rotation and changes in lactin, or sugar
  of milk, through a series of optical and chemical experiments. They determine the
  permanent specific rotation of lactin and examine the phenomenon of its changing
  rotatory power in a freshly prepared solution.
topics:
- Lactin
- Optical Rotation
- Chemical Analysis
- Polarimetry
- Sugar of Milk
