revised_title: The Role of Tissue Nutrition and Blood Vessels in Oedema Formation
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the factors contributing to oedema formation, concluding
  that tissue nutrition and the excess supply of lymph play a more significant role
  than blood vessels. The study shows that oedema is a result of an overactive process
  of tissue absorption and waste removal, rather than solely due to blood vessel function.
