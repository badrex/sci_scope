revised_title: Morphological Analysis and Classification of Leptosporangiate Ferns
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Botany
tldr: The author examines the morphology of spore-producing members in leptosporangiate
  ferns, proposing a new classification system based on the order of sporangia appearance,
  annulus position, and other structural features. This system strengthens the characters
  used for classification and provides a better understanding of fern evolution and
  relationships.
