  Daniell and W. A. Miller'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors, J. Frederic Daniell and W. A. Miller, investigate the electrolysis
  of secondary compounds, focusing on the influence of water in aqueous solutions
  and the behavior of phosphates. They use a diaphragm cell to measure the electrolysis
  results and discuss the transfer of ions and the constitution of salts.
