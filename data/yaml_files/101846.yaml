revised_title: Exploring the Factors Behind the Floating of Dissolved Bodies in Lighter
  Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates why bodies dissolved in liquids lighter than themselves
  float, proposing that the natural inclination of liquid particles to unite and the
  resistance offered by the liquid play a significant role in overcoming the force
  of gravity for minute particles.
