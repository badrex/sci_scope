revised_title: The Limit of the Liquid State and the Four States of Matter
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: 'The author investigates the limit of the liquid state by examining the critical
  temperature and pressure of various liquids. They find that the liquid state is
  bounded by an isothermal line passing through the critical point and propose a new
  classification of matter into four states: gaseous, vaporous, liquid, and solid.'
topics:
- Phase Transitions
- Critical Temperature
- Surface Tension
- Capillary Action
- Vapor Pressure
