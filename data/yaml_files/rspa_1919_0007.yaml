revised_title: Investigation of Extreme Ultra-Violet Spectra with a Vacuum-Grating
  Spectrograph
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors present a method for measuring extreme ultra-violet spectra using
  a vacuum-grating spectrograph. They successfully measure wave-lengths in the Schumann
  region and study the spectra of carbon, mercury, iron, copper, and zinc, contributing
  to the understanding of the properties of these elements and their applications
  in various scientific fields.
