  of Paralysis of the Fifth Pair'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author presents a case study of a patient with paralysis of the fifth pair
  of nerves, which demonstrates that the senses of smell and vision can function independently
  of these nerves, while taste is solely derived from them. This case supports Sir
  Charles Bell's views on the physiology of nerves.
