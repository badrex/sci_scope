revised_title: 'The Pupil of an Optical System and Perspective: A Study of Image Formation
  and Perspective in Optical Instruments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the concept of the entrance and exit pupils in optical
  systems, demonstrating their role in determining the perspective of images formed.
  By considering the position and size of these pupils, the author explains how optical
  instruments can be better understood and their perspective accurately predicted.
topics:
- Optical Systems
- Perspective
- Gauss Planes
- Exit Pupil
- Image Formation
