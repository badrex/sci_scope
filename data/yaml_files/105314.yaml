revised_title: An Investigation into the Cause of Earthquakes and Their Relation to
  Ocean Waves
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Seismology & Earthquake Engineering
tldr: The author observes a small earthquake near a coastal cave in Guadaloupe and
  connects the phenomenon to the movement of ocean waves. He suggests that the compressed
  air within the cave, caused by the waves, leads to the earthquake and the subsequent
  release of wind through a hole in the ground.
