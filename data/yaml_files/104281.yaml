revised_title: Improving and Perfecting Catadioptrical Telescopes with Glass Speculums
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a new method to improve and perfect catadioptrical telescopes
  by using glass instead of metal for the speculums. The method involves correcting
  errors caused by the different refraction of light rays and rectifying the spherical
  figure of the speculum, potentially leading to more accurate and precise telescopes.
