revised_title: Investigating the Anomaly in Ship-Board Magnetic Needle Variations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the anomalies in the variation of the magnetic needle
  observed on ship-board, attributing them to the concentration of the magnetic influence
  of iron used in ship construction. The study provides practical rules for adjusting
  compass readings based on the ship's position and iron content, improving maritime
  navigation accuracy.
