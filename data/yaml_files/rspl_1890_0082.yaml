revised_title: Graphical Representation of Ternary Alloys and Equilibrium in Fused
  Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors present a method of graphical representation to analyze the composition
  of ternary alloys and the equilibrium in fused mixtures. They demonstrate this method
  using experiments with lead, zinc, and tin, and discuss the critical curve and the
  system of lines that represent the results of the experiments.
