revised_title: The Influence of Nitrogen in Promoting Vegetable Decomposition and
  Its Connection with Plant Growth
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author, Robert Rigg, investigates the influence of nitrogen in promoting
  vegetable decomposition and its connection with plant growth. He finds that the
  amount of spontaneous decomposition is proportional to the quantity of nitrogen
  in the plant, and that nitrogen plays a dual role in favoring chemical decomposition
  by the roots of plants while also assimilating the formed matter in their other
  parts.
