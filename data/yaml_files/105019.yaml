revised_title: A Method of Creating Artificial Magnets without Natural Ones
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetism
tldr: John Canton discovers a method to create artificial magnets without using natural
  ones, by magnetizing bars of hardened steel through a specific process. The resulting
  magnets can lift significant weights and have magnetic strength comparable to natural
  magnets.
