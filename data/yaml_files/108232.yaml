tldr: The author investigates the changes in the ovarian ovum before and after fecundation,
  focusing on the germinal vesicle and germinal spot. The study reveals that the germinal
  vesicle fills with cells, which in turn fill with the foundations of other cells,
  altering its appearance and suggesting a new understanding of cell origin and development.
