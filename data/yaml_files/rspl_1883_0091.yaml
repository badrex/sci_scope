revised_title: Magnetic Balance and Experimental Researches in Iron and Steel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author develops a magnetic balance to measure the magnetic capacity of various
  types of iron and steel. The research reveals that magnetic capacity is directly
  related to the softness or molecular freedom of the material, and resistance to
  external magnetizing force is directly related to its hardness or molecular rigidity.

- Magnetic Balance
- Iron and Steel Properties
