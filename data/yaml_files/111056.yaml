  Between Electricity and Nervous Force'

tldr: The author, Signor C. Matteucci, investigates the conductibility of nervous
  matter and the relationship between electricity and nervous force. He conducts experiments
  on the relative conductibility of muscles and nerves, and explores the effects of
  electric currents on the excitability of nerves. He concludes that the phenomena
  observed are due to the influence of the electric current on the nervous force contained
  in the nerves, and that this force acts depending on the direction of the electric
  current.
