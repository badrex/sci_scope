  II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the effects of strain on the thermo-electric qualities
  of various metals, including steel, aluminium, nickel, lead, and other alloys. The
  research focuses on the differences in thermo-electric effects between strained
  and unstrained metal wires, as well as the impact of annealing on these properties.
topics:
- Thermo-electricity
- Metals
- Strain
