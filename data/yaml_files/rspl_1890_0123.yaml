revised_title: On the Generalization of Electrodynamics Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the generalization of electrodynamics theory, considering
  non-circuital currents and the distribution of energy in electrical fields. The
  study explores the relationship between electric displacement, surface density,
  and specific inductive capacity, and discusses the potential implications for understanding
  electromagnetic interactions.
