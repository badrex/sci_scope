revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of the Bessemer Process Flame Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the flame spectra of the Bessemer process and analyzes
  the spectroscopic phenomena and thermo-chemistry involved. They find that the spectrum
  is a complex one, with differences in constitution during different periods of the
  process. The non-appearance of lines at the commencement and termination of the
  blow is due to the insufficient volatilization of metal and the low temperature,
  while the presence of alkali metals is attributed to their presence as silicates.
