revised_title: Connective Tissue Calcification in Dentine Formation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the structure and development of dentine and suggest
  that it is formed by connective tissue calcification, more closely resembling bone
  formation than previously thought. They propose that the formative cells of dentine,
  along with odontoblasts, secrete a material that calcifies along the lines of connective
  tissue fibers.
