tldr: The author investigates the Cesaro convergence properties of restricted Fourier
  series, showing that they share the convergence properties of Fourier series and
  demonstrating the relationship between the upper and lower functions of these series.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Cesaro convergence
- Trigonometrical series
- Restricted Fourier series
