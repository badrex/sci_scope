scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author, Lyon Playfair, discovers a new class of salts called nitroprussides
  through the reaction of nitric acid on ferrocyanides. The nitroprussides exhibit
  unique color-changing properties when mixed with soluble sulfides, and their composition
  and separation from other compounds are explored in this study.
