revised_title: The Refraction Equivalents of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen
  in Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the refraction equivalents of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
  and nitrogen in organic compounds, finding that carbon has multiple equivalents
  depending on its atomic structure, while hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen have distinct
  values. The study provides insights into the influence of chemical constitution
  on the refraction of light.
