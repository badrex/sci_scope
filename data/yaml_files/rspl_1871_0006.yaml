revised_title: Periodic Change of Terrestrial Magnetism and Sun's Rotation
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Professor Hornstein discovered a periodic change in the elements of terrestrial
  magnetism with a period of 26.33 days. He attributes these changes to the sun's
  rotation and finds that the true periodic time of the sun's rotation is 24.55 days,
  which is close to the time of rotation of sunspots in the sun's equator.
