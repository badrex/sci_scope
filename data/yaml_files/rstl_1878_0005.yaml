revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Electric Discharge with the Chloride
  of Silver Battery
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Batteries
tldr: The authors investigate the electric discharge with the chloride of silver battery,
  measuring its electro-motive force and studying the discharge at ordinary atmospheric
  pressures. They also examine the striking distance and the length of the spark in
  various gases, contributing to the understanding of the cause of stratification
  in exhausted tubes.
