tldr: The author investigates the necessary and sufficient conditions for a trigonometrical
  series to be the Fourier series of a function of bounded variation, focusing on
  successions of integrals and Cesaro summation.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Trigonometrical series
- Cesaro summation
- Functions of bounded variation
- Successions of integrals
