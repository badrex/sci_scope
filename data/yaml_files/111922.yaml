revised_title: Experiments on the Transit-Velocity of Waves through Rock Formations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: This study investigates the transit velocity of waves through rock formations
  in Holyhead, North Wales, using experiments involving the explosion of large amounts
  of gunpowder in mines. The author finds that the transit rate tends to increase
  with the increased quantity of powder, and that the wave velocity in the tested
  rock is lower than in other media such as wet sand and solid granite.
