revised_title: An Experimental Research on the Intrinsic Brilliancy of the Crater
  of the Arc
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the intrinsic brilliancy of the crater of an electric
  arc and its potential as a standard of light. They find that while the arc's intrinsic
  brilliancy is high, variations in the arc's conditions and the presence of atmospheric
  impurities make it unsuitable as a primary standard. However, the research provides
  valuable insights into the behavior of the electric arc and its potential applications.
