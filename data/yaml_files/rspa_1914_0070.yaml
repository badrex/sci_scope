revised_title: Investigation of Axial Chromatic Aberration in the Human Eye
scientific_discipline: Optics & Light
scientific_subdiscipline: Vision & Color Perception
tldr: The author investigates the axial chromatic aberration of the human eye using
  a monochromatic illuminator and a movable lens. The results show that all tested
  eyes have some degree of correction, with varying levels of success in different
  regions of the spectrum. The study also reveals new types of corrections in lens
  optics and provides insight into anomalous trichromatic color vision.
