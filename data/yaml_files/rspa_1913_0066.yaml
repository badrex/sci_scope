tldr: This paper presents an experimental investigation of the flow of viscous fluids
  through orifices. The authors use a variety of techniques to measure the coefficient
  of discharge (Cd) and analyze the effects of viscosity and inertia forces on the
  flow. They find that the Cd is influenced by both the head and the viscosity of
  the fluid, and that the curve of Cd against head is not a simple parabola due to
  the non-linear relationship between stress and the rate of distortion in the oil
  used in the experiments.
