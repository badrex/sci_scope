revised_title: Investigating the Resistance of Air on Falling Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the impact of air resistance on
  falling objects. By comparing the fall times of various solid and hollow balls,
  the author concludes that air resistance significantly affects the rate at which
  objects fall, with larger and lighter objects experiencing a greater impact.
