revised_title: Magnetic Needle Influences and Corrections in Observations
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Edward J. Johnson investigates the reciprocal influence of magnetic needles
  at different positions on Earth. He conducts experiments at Yarmouth, London, and
  Clifton, and presents the results in tabular form. Johnson believes that comparing
  observations of deflections can help determine local influences and provide corrections
  for magnetic observations.
