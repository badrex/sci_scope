revised_title: On the Application of the Law of Conservation of Energy to Determine
  Magnetic Meridian on Board Ship
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author applies the law of conservation of energy to determine the magnetic
  meridian on board a ship when out of reach or out of sight of land. The paper presents
  a theorem and formulae for calculating the true magnetic azimuth of a distant object
  using the apparent magnetic bearings observed at different compass points. The method
  can be useful in magnetic surveys of the ocean.
