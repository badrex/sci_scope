  Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: This study examines the effects of various organic and inorganic compounds on
  liver cells, focusing on changes in size, mitoma, biliary canaliculi, glycogen distribution,
  and iron reaction. The results indicate that different compounds, such as pilocarpine,
  toluene, and benzol, have distinct effects on liver cells, which may be related
  to their physiological and chemical properties.
