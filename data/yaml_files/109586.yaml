revised_title: Analysis of the Magnetic Pyrites and Their Relation to Other Sulphurets
  of Iron

scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: Charles Hatchett analyzes the magnetical pyrites and other sulphurets of iron,
  discovering their unique chemical and magnetic properties. He finds that the magnetical
  pyrites are composed of sulfur and iron in a specific ratio and that this ratio
  is crucial for the magnetic properties. Hatchett also compares the properties of
  magnetical pyrites to those of other iron compounds, such as carburets and phosphorets,
  and suggests potential applications for these materials.
