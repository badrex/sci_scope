revised_title: The Influence of Light, Air, and Soil on the Tubercle Bacillus
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The author investigates the effect of light, air, and soil on the tubercle bacillus
  and finds that fresh air and light, along with a dry sandy soil, have a significant
  influence in reducing the virulence of the bacillus. Darkness seems to interfere
  with this disinfectant action, but exposure to light in poor sanitary conditions
  does not eliminate the virus.
