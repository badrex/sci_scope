scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory of sound and wave motion, discovering
  an integral for a class of differential equations related to wave motion. The theory
  accounts for various phenomena, such as the velocity of sound, the formation of
  bores in waves, and the transmission of sound through different media.
