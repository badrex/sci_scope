scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author, James Anderson, investigates the peculiarities of tides between
  Fairleigh and the North Foreland and challenges the widely held belief that tides
  from the North Sea and the Channel meet near Dungeness. He proposes that the real
  cause of these tidal states is the sudden contraction of the channel between Dungeness
  and Cape D'Alpree, which leads to the accumulation and redistribution of water within
  the area.
