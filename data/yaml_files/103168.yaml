tldr: This article describes the autopsy findings of a 72-year-old man who died of
  asthma. The right kidney was significantly contracted and had two large hydatides,
  while the left kidney was lessened but not as much as the right. The bladder contained
  unusual-shaped stones, and the stomach showed signs of increased blood vessels and
  stronger muscular fibers. The chest cavity was filled with water, reducing the size
  of the lungs, and the pleura was thickened by serum. The valves of the left ventricle
  of the heart were petrified, and stony bodies were found on the bronchia.
