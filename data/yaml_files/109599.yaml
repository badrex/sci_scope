revised_title: Experiments on the Composition and Formation of Wootz Steel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author examines the composition and formation of Wootz steel, a unique type
  of steel known for its hardness and quality. Through a series of experiments, he
  determines that Wootz steel contains a higher proportion of carbonaceous matter
  than common cast steel, which contributes to its hardness and lack of homogeneity.
  Despite its imperfections, Wootz steel is considered valuable due to its excellent
  raw materials and potential for improvement with better production methods.
