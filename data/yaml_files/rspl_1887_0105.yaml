revised_title: An Investigation into the Viscosity and Tensile Strength of Ice
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the viscosity and tensile
  strength of ice at low temperatures. Using a custom-built testing machine, the author
  measures the extension of ice specimens under tension and finds that the viscosity
  increases with decreasing temperature.
