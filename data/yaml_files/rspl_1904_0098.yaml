  and the Development of Protective Elements in the Human Organism

scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the action of human blood fluids on Staphylococcus pyogenes
  and find that successful immunization against the bacteria is associated with increased
  phagocytic power. They also discover that the opsonic effect, which enhances phagocytosis,
  is dependent on the blood fluids rather than modifications in the white blood cells.
