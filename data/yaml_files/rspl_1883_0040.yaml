  Strings
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the role of the sound-post in a violin's construction
  and its effect on the instrument's tone. Experiments show that the sound-post contributes
  to the support of the belly and influences the nodal arrangement of the plates.
  The author also explores the impact of different materials and structures on the
  sound quality and vibration transmission.
topics:
- Violin Acoustics
- Sound-Post Function
- String Thickness
