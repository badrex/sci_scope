scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Urology & Nephrology
tldr: The author proposes using mucilaginous substances like syrup of marshmallows,
  gum Arabic, or barley water to remove bladder stones painlessly and efficiently.
  The substances' high viscosity and impelling force make them ideal for this purpose,
  as they can dislodge stones with less risk of complications and discomfort compared
  to using thin urine.
