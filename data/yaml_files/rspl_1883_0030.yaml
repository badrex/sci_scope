  on the Corona and Prominences

tldr: The authors, Arthur Schuster and Captain W. de W. Abney, investigate the total
  solar eclipse of May 17, 1882, focusing on the corona and prominences. They use
  various photographic techniques to capture the corona's shape, structure, and changes
  during the eclipse. The study reveals the connection between the corona's outline
  and the sun's surface, as well as the differences in prominences' temperature and
  intensity of spectral lines.
