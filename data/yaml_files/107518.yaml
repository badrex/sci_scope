scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the Torpedo of the Cape of Good Hope, investigating its
  electrical organs, their function, and the relationship between the nervous system
  and the ability to discharge shocks. The study concludes that the electrical discharge
  is a vital action dependent on the animal's life and voluntary action, and that
  the loss of the power to communicate shocks may be due to the loss of voluntary
  control over the organ.
