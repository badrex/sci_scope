revised_title: Inheritance of Coat Color in Thoroughbred Racehorses
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: The author analyzes the offspring of thoroughbred chestnut mares and finds that
  the inheritance of coat color in racehorses cannot be explained by a simple Mendelian
  formula. The study highlights the variability in the power of transmitting colors
  by chestnut sires, which challenges the application of a Mendelian theory to coat
  color inheritance in horses.
