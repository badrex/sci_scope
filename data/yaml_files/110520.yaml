revised_title: Improving Voltaic Batteries with a New Principle
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy Storage
tldr: Frederick W. Mullins presents a new method for constructing voltaic batteries
  that allows for a continuous, equally powerful current for any desired duration.
  This method involves using a thin membrane to separate fluids applied to the metals
  in the circuit, with potential for further improvements in battery performance.
