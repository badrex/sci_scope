revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Conducting Power of Magnetic Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Faraday investigates the conducting power of magnetic substances and their effects
  on magnetic fields. He explains how paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances influence
  the lines of force in a magnetic field, with paramagnetic substances concentrating
  the lines of force and diamagnetic substances causing a divergence of the lines.
