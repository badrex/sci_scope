revised_title: A New Approach to Generating Functions in Number Theory
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates a certain class of generating functions in number theory,
  focusing on the relationship between redundant and condensed forms. The main theorem
  states that the generating function for the coefficients of a particular redundant
  function can be expressed as a function of the coaxial minors of the determinant
  of the given quantities.
