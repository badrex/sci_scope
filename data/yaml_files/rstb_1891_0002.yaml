revised_title: 'Anatomy and Development of Apteryx: A Study of Embryonic Stages and
  Growth Patterns'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: This study investigates the anatomy and development of Apteryx, examining various
  stages of embryonic growth and comparing them to the adult form. The research focuses
  on the skeletal structure, including the skull, vertebral column, sternum, shoulder
  girdle, fore-limb, pelvic girdle, hind-limb, and muscles of the wing. The findings
  contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between Apteryx
  and other bird species.
