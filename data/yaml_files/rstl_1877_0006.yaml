revised_title: Investigation of the Absorption Spectra of Bromine and Iodine Monochloride
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors compare the absorption spectra of bromine and iodine monochloride,
  finding that while many bands are nearly coincident, the spectra are not identical.
  They provide detailed measurements and analysis of the spectra, including the effects
  of temperature on the spectra's characteristics.
