revised_title: High-Voltage Continuous Current Production Using Mercury-Rectifiers
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Power Systems
tldr: Sir Oliver J. Lodge introduces a method to produce a high-voltage continuous
  current using mercury-rectifiers, enabling the utilization of ordinary sources of
  supply. This method can transform and trap high-tension intermittent or jerky currents,
  storing them in reservoirs for continuous discharge through high resistance.
