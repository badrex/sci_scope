scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the sensory nerves in eye and extraocular muscles, discovering
  that the majority of myelinated nerve fibers in these muscles come from the oculomotorius
  nerve. The study also reveals that the absence of muscle spindles does not exclude
  the presence of sensorial end-organs and afferent nerve fibers in certain muscles.
