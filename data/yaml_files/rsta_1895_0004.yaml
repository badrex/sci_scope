revised_title: On the Dynamical Theory of Incompressible Viscous Fluids and the Determination
  of the Criterion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of incompressible viscous fluids and introduces
  the Reynolds number as a criterion for the onset of turbulence in fluid flow. The
  study provides a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics and the resistance experienced
  by objects moving through fluids.
