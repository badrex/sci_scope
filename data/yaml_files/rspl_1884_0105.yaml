revised_title: The Influence of Chlorides on the Solubility of Calcium Sulphate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The authors investigate the solubility of calcium sulfate in water in the presence
  of various chlorides, finding that the solubility is increased by sodium and ammonium
  chloride but decreased by calcium chloride. The study also reveals that solubility
  greatly diminishes at temperatures above 100Â°C.
