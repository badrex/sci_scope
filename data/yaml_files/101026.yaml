revised_title: Investigating the Loss of Medicinal Virtues in Mineral Waters
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Water Treatment
tldr: The author examines the loss of medicinal properties in mineral waters and suggests
  that the cause may be due to a chemical reaction between the water's components,
  leading to the formation of a sediment or ochre. This hypothesis is based on the
  work of Tachenius and challenges the widely accepted idea of volatile spirits being
  responsible for the loss of properties in mineral waters.
