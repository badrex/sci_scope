revised_title: Recalculated Specific Heats and Explosion Temperatures of Explosives
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: Sir Andrew Noble recalculates the specific heats of various explosives, such
  as cordite, M.D., and nitrocellulose, using new data on the specific heat of carbonic
  anhydride. He also determines the explosion temperatures of these explosives through
  two different methods and discusses the differences in results.
topics:
- Explosives
- Specific Heat
- Temperature of Explosion
- Calorimetry
- Densities of Explosives
