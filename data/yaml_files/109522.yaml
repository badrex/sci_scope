scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Processes
tldr: Richard Walker investigates the use of muriate of lime to produce artificial
  cold. He reports on experiments with muriated lime and snow, which resulted in significant
  refrigeration. Walker also discusses different frigorific mixtures and suggests
  a method for obtaining transparent ice for optical purposes.
