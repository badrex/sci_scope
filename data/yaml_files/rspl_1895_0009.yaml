revised_title: 'Acokanthera Schimperi: Its Crystalline Glucosidal Active Principle
  and Pharmacological Action'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors examine the wood of Acokanthera Schimperi, discovering that it is
  used by various African tribes to create arrow-poison. They identify a crystalline
  glucosidal active principle in the wood, which they suggest should be named acokantherin
  instead of ouabain. The pharmacological action of this substance is similar to that
  of Strophanthus seeds, with a primary effect on the heart and striped muscles.
