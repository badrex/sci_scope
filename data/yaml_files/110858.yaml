revised_title: The Conversion of Lithic Acid to Oxalic Acid by Sunlight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Biochemistry
tldr: John Davy investigates the effect of sunlight on lithic acid and discovers that
  it can convert lithic acid into oxalic acid. This process may explain the absence
  of lithate of ammonia in guano, as seen in a specimen from the island of Ichabor.
