revised_title: Easy Methods for Measuring the Diminution of Bulk in Nitrous and Common
  Air Mixtures and Experiments on Platina
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author presents two methods for measuring the diminution of bulk when mixing
  nitrous and common air, as well as experiments on platina. The first method uses
  a glass tube and an elastic gum bottle, while the second method involves a mercury
  column. The author also discusses the magnetic properties of platina particles.
