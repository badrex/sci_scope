revised_title: 'The Influence of Pressure on the Boiling Points of Metals: Part I
  and II'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of pressure on the boiling points of various
  metals using a vacuum and high-pressure furnace. They find that the boiling points
  of all studied metals, when expressed on the absolute scale, conform to Ramsay and
  Young's law, showing a similar dependency on pressure.
topics:
- Boiling Points
- Metals
- High Pressure
- Vacuum
- Temperature Measurements
