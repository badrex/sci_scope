revised_title: Investigating Diurnal Variations of Electric Waves in Nature and Their
  Propagation Around the Earth's Bend
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Propagation
tldr: The authors study the diurnal variations of natural electric waves and their
  propagation around the Earth's bend. They observe a decrease in the number and intensity
  of these waves during daytime and a significant lull at sunrise and sunset. The
  authors propose that the propagation of electric waves may be hindered by an unknown
  effect of twilight, suggesting a need for an extension of the existing scheme of
  wave propagation.
