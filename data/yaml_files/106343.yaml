scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author compares Sir George Shuckburgh and Colonel Roy's rules for measuring
  heights with a barometer, discussing the differences in their equations and the
  impact of temperature and atmospheric pressure on their results. Shuckburgh argues
  for the importance of considering the expansion of quicksilver and air in these
  measurements.
