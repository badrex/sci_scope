revised_title: Effects of Partial Thyroidectomy on Animals and Its Connection to Graves'
  Disease
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Metabolism
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of partial thyroidectomy on animals and
  discover that the remaining thyroid tissue hypertrophies and alters its secretion.
  They also observe a resemblance between these changes and those found in cases of
  Graves' disease, suggesting a possible cause for the goitre in this condition.
