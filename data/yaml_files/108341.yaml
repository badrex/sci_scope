revised_title: Magnetic Diurnal Variation at St. Helena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of magnetic declination at St.
  Helena and finds that the phenomenon is consistent with the hypothesis that the
  line of least magnetic force serves as a dividing line between the two magnetic
  hemispheres. The study is based on five years of observations and provides valuable
  insights into the understanding of Earth's magnetic field.
