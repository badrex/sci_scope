tldr: The author investigates the effects of light on selenium and the spectra of
  various chemical compounds and mechanical mixtures. The study reveals that the resistance
  of selenium is significantly affected by exposure to light, and the spectra of chemical
  compounds and mechanical mixtures can provide valuable insights into their molecular
  structures and properties.
