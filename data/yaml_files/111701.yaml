tldr: The author investigates Fermat's theorems of polygonal numbers, specifically
  focusing on the second theorem that states every number can be composed of four
  square numbers. The paper presents a table demonstrating a remarkable law regarding
  the division of odd numbers into four square numbers and discusses the implications
  of this law.
