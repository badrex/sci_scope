tldr: This study investigates the effects of hydroxylamine and nitrites on blood pressure,
  finding that both substances cause a similar decrease in blood pressure. The authors
  conclude that hydroxylamine's action on blood pressure is due to its own properties
  and not impurities, as the sample used was deemed pure.
