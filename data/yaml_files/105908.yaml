revised_title: New Theorems for Computing Areas of Certain Curve Lines
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents new theorems for calculating the areas of specific curve
  lines, offering concise methods without the need for resolving expressions for ordinates.
  These theorems apply to curves with abscissas x and ordinates expressed as x^(m-1)/(a^n
  + x^n), x^(n+m-1)/(a^n + x^n*x^e), and x^(n-m-1)/(a^2n + 2ca^n*x^n + x^2n). The
  theorems have implications for computing areas of curves with more complex expressions,
  such as x^p/(p+q*x^n+r*x^2n+x^3n) and x^p/(p+q*x^n+r*x^2n+s*x^3n+x^4n).
