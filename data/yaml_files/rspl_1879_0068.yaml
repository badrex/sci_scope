revised_title: On the Reversal of Metallic Vapour Lines in Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the reversal of lines in metallic vapours' spectra,
  observing reversals in various elements such as sodium, calcium, and strontium.
  They also note the effects of different conditions and materials on the reversals,
  providing insights into the behavior of metallic vapours in spectroscopy.
