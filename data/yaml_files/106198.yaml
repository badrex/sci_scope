revised_title: Observations on the Rate of a Clock and the Effects of Environmental
  Factors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Timekeeping
tldr: The author, Francis Wollaston, observes the rate of a clock over multiple years
  and investigates the effects of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,
  and building vibrations on its accuracy. He finds that the clock's rate is most
  affected by moisture and suggests that a strong coat of varnish on the pendulum
  rod could help reduce the impact of external factors.
