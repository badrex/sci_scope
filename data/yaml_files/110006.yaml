tldr: The author, William Buckland, describes the discovery of fossilized teeth and
  bones of various animals, including the hyaena, elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus,
  found in a cave in Kirkdale, Yorkshire. He suggests that these remains are from
  a pre-diluvian period and discusses the habits of the hyaena and the possible ways
  these animals could have entered the cave. He also provides a comparative view of
  similar caverns in England and on the Continent.
