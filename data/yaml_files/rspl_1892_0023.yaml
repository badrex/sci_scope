revised_title: On the Mathematical Theory of Electro-magnetism and its Fundamental
  Assumptions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory of electromagnetism, focusing on its
  fundamental assumptions and their consequences. The theory explores the relationship
  between electric and magnetic fields, as well as the behavior of electric currents
  and displacements, offering a new perspective on Maxwell's work.
