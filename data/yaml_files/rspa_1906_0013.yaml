revised_title: Catalytic Combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen on Various Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Catalysis
tldr: The authors investigate the slow combination of hydrogen and oxygen on various
  heated surfaces, including porous porcelain, magnesia, metals, and reducible oxides.
  They find that the rate of combination is directly proportional to the pressure
  and that hydrogen plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, often being occluded
  or forming an unstable hydride at the surface.
