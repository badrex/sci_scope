revised_title: 'The Discovery of Amygdalase: A Specific Enzyme in Yeast for Hydrolyzing
  Amygdalin'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the enzymes in yeast and discover a specific enzyme,
  amygdalase, that is responsible for hydrolyzing amygdalin into glucose and amygdonitrileglucoside,
  rather than maltase as previously believed.
