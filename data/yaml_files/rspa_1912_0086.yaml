revised_title: 'On the Multiplication of Successions of Fourier Constants: Extensions
  and Applications'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the multiplication of successions of Fourier constants
  and demonstrates how this can be applied to extend Parseval's theorem and explore
  the convergence of various series. The study also reveals the limitations of the
  method and its applicability to continuous functions.
topics:
- Fourier Analysis
- Fourier Series
- Parseval's Theorem
- Series Convergence
- Function Summability
