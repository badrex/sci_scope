revised_title: The Invention and Description of a New Catoptric Micrometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Instrumentation
tldr: The author presents a new catoptric micrometer that uses the principle of reflection
  to measure angles with improved accuracy and precision. The device avoids the limitations
  of previous micrometers and offers advantages such as not being affected by the
  heterogeneity of light and having no aberration or defects due to the imperfection
  of materials or execution.
