revised_title: The Synthesis and Properties of a New Acid in the Lactic Series
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the reaction between iodide of ethyl and oxalate of
  methyl using zinc, resulting in a new acid with properties similar to leucic acid.
  They describe the synthesis process, properties, and analysis of this new acid,
  which they believe to be distinct from previously known acids in the lactic series.
