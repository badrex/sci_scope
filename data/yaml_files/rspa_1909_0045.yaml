revised_title: Reevaluation of the Absolute Value of the Mechanical Equivalent of
  Heat in Terms of International Electrical Units
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The authors reevaluate the absolute value of the mechanical equivalent of heat
  using improved standards and methods, finding a value of 1.4333 international volts
  at 15Â°C. They also compare their results with previous measurements and find a divergence
  of 1 part in 2000.
topics:
- Mechanical equivalent of heat
- International electrical units
- Calorimetry
- Thermal capacity of water
- Standards of electromotive force
