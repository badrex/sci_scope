revised_title: The Effect of Water Vapour on the Velocities of Ions Produced by X-Rays
  in Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of water vapor on the velocities of ions
  produced by X-rays in air. They find that while the removal of water vapor has a
  small effect on the velocities of positive ions, it significantly increases the
  velocities of negative ions by a factor ranging between 2 and 30.
