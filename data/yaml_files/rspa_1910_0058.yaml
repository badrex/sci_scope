revised_title: On the Rotatory Character of Some Terrestrial Magnetic Disturbances
  at Greenwich and Their Diurnal Distribution
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author investigates the rotatory character of terrestrial magnetic disturbances
  at Greenwich and their diurnal distribution. They analyze the changes in magnetic
  force and direction, finding that some disturbances result from more or less conical
  motion of the line of total force, with negative rotatory movements occurring before
  midnight and positive, right-handed rotations after that hour.
