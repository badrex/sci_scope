scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author, Abraham Brook, presents a new electrometer design that measures
  the repulsive power of electricity between two balls, allowing for more accurate
  determination of electrical charges. The instrument is made of metal and glass,
  making it less susceptible to electrical leakage, and can be used universally as
  long as the coated surface and ball size are known.
