revised_title: 'Displacement of a Rigid Body by Rotations: A Preliminary Study'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Vector Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the conditions of the arbitrary displacement of a rigid
  body in space by means of rotations only, and compares the results with those of
  Rodrigues' theorem. The study focuses on the displacement by successive rotations
  around a pair of axes and the relationship between these axes and the corresponding
  translations.
