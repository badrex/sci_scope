revised_title: Corrections to the Computed Lengths of Waves of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: George Biddell Airy corrects his previous computations of light wave lengths
  and provides a table of corrections for the entire range of Kirchhoff's lines. He
  also discusses the discrepancies between the results of his computations and the
  actual measurements of numerous wavelengths, as well as the possible origins of
  spectral lines produced by the atmosphere and metals.
