revised_title: Unilateral Conductivity of Vacuous Spaces and Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Discharges
tldr: The author discusses the unilateral conductivity of vacuous spaces with unequally
  heated electrodes, examining the electric discharge and electromotive force when
  a discharge occurs from a carbon conductor to another electrode. The findings demonstrate
  that the discharge occurs at a lower electromotive force when the carbon conductor
  is the negative electrode and is incandescent.
