tldr: The author discovers a new crinoid species, Thaumatocrinus renovatus, from the
  Southern Sea, featuring unique characteristics such as a closed ring of basals,
  separation of radials by interradial plates, and a jointed arm-like appendage on
  the anal side. This species is distinct from other known crinoids and provides valuable
  insights into the evolution and classification of these marine creatures.
