revised_title: Investigation of Specific Heat and Physical Properties of Methylic
  Alcohol and Water Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors study the specific heat, heat evolution, and physical properties
  of mixtures of methylic alcohol and water. They propose a relationship between the
  specific heat of a mixture and the heat evolved or absorbed during its formation.
  The findings could potentially help calculate the specific heat of one constituent
  in a mixture if the specific heat of the other constituent, the mixture's specific
  heat, and the heat evolved or absorbed at two different temperatures are known.
