revised_title: The Influence of Stress and Strain on the Elasticity of Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of stress and strain on the elasticity of
  metals, finding that permanent extension and loading can increase a metal's elasticity.
  They also discover that the rate of increase of elasticity varies among different
  metals and that the behavior of iron is unique due to its high coercive force.
