revised_title: Effects of Heat on Saline Solutions and Hydrated Metallic Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the effects of heat on the absorption spectra and chemical
  constitution of saline solutions. The author presents four conclusions regarding
  the behavior of metallic salts in water and their hydrated compounds when exposed
  to heat. Additionally, the paper discusses the action of heat on violet hydrated
  compounds of chromium, which results in a different class of salts with distinct
  properties.
