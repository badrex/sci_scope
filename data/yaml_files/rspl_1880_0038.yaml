scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author examines the design and functionality of the torsion gravimeter,
  a device used to measure changes in gravity, and identifies its limitations and
  potential improvements. The gravimeter, designed by J. Allan Broun, is compared
  to other similar instruments, such as the bathometer, and its principles are discussed
  in detail.
