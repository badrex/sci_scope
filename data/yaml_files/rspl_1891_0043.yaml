scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the closure of the larynx and provides a detailed description
  of the mechanism involved, focusing on the role of arytenoid cartilages and the
  epiglottis. The study includes observations on humans, animals, and patients with
  altered anatomy, offering insights into the complex process of laryngeal closure
  during swallowing and forced efforts.
