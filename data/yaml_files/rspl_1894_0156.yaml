revised_title: Maxwell's Theorem and Internal Movements in Atomic Spectra
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author argues that Maxwell's theorem of equal energy partition among atomic
  degrees of freedom is not inconsistent with the internal movements exhibited by
  gas spectra. He suggests that the ether's control over electron motion can define
  the motion of a few atoms, reducing the number of degrees of freedom and maintaining
  the ratio of specific heats.
