revised_title: Experimental Determination of Critical Electron Velocities for Ionization
  and Radiation in Argon Atoms
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the critical electron velocities required for the production
  of radiation and ionization when colliding with argon atoms. They use a modified
  experimental setup to study the effects of varying electron velocities and observe
  the resulting ionization and radiation. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of electrons in collisions with argon atoms and contributes to the understanding
  of electron-ion interactions.
