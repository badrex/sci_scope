scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: John Davy discovers a new gaseous compound formed by the reaction of carbonic
  oxide and chlorine. The compound exhibits distinct physical and chemical properties,
  including a strong odor and the ability to turn litmus paper red. It also reacts
  with ammonia, forming a neutral salt and decomposing when exposed to water or certain
  acids.
