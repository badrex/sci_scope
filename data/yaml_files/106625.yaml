revised_title: Experiments on Freezing Mixtures and Cold Production
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: Henry Cavendish and John Mc Nab conduct experiments on freezing mixtures and
  cold production using various chemicals, such as nitre and vitriolic acids. They
  explore the factors affecting the degree of cold produced and the role of dilution
  in the freezing process. The experiments also involve testing the effectiveness
  of different thermometers in measuring extreme temperatures.
