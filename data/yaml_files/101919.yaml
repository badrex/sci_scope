tldr: The author demonstrates how to determine the specific gravity of various substances
  and detect counterfeits by weighing them in water. The method involves comparing
  the weights of substances in air and water, and using standards like rock crystal
  and ice to establish proportions. The author also explores the examination of fluids
  and solids dissolved in water, as well as the weight of liquors by weighing solids
  in them.
