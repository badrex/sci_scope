  Patients
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Surgery & Urology
tldr: The author proposes a minimally invasive surgical procedure to create an artificial
  fistula in the perineum for patients with bladder stones who cannot undergo traditional
  surgeries due to age or health complications. This method allows for the relief
  of symptoms and gradual removal of stones without the risks associated with more
  invasive procedures.
