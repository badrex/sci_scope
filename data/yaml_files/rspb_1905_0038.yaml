revised_title: A Reevaluation of the Mechanics of Sap Ascent in Trees
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This article challenges the notion that sap in trees experiences high hydrostatic
  pressure and proposes that the weight of the sap in each vessel is mainly supported
  by the walls and base of the vessel, rather than being transmitted through its osmotically
  porous base to the vessels beneath it. The author suggests that a steady gradient
  of concentration could become self-adjusting through assistance from the plant's
  vital stimuli and that local pressures in excess or defect of normal atmospheric
  amounts might accumulate.
