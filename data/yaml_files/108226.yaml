scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Clockwork
tldr: The article describes an improved escapement mechanism for astronomical clocks,
  invented by Captain Henry Kater. The new design aims to provide equal impulse to
  the pendulum, improving accuracy and performance compared to existing mechanisms.
  The invention is based on the principle of using the pendulum's weight to provide
  an increased space in its descent, without interfering with the train or balance
  of the clock.
