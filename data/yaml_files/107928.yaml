tldr: The author describes the development and use of a new, improved leveling instrument
  for accurately measuring the difference in level between the River Thames at London
  Bridge and the sea, as well as determining the height of intermediate points. The
  instrument features enhanced stability, motion, delicacy, and a powerful telescope
  for precise observations.
