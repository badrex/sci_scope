revised_title: The Discovery and Characterization of Actinium's Parent Element
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the parent element of actinium and its genetic relations
  to uranium and radium. They explore the decay and disintegration products of these
  elements, and discuss the possibility of multiple stable arrangements within the
  atomic structure leading to different products with varying chemical properties.
