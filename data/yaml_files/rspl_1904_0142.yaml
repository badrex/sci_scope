revised_title: Polarized X-ray Radiation and Its Polarization Properties
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors investigate the polarization properties of X-ray radiation and find
  that secondary radiation is partially polarized. They also discover that the intensity
  of the secondary radiation depends on the angle between the primary and secondary
  beams, and the type of substance used as the radiator.
