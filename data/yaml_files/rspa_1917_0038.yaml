revised_title: Problems of Residual Affinity in Chemical Bonding
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Bonding
tldr: The author investigates the concept of residual affinity in chemical bonding,
  discussing the existence of higher valencies and the properties of molecular and
  metallo-compounds. The study focuses on the heat evolution during the formation
  of chemical bonds and the role of residual affinity in the stability of compounds.
