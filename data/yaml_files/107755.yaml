scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Positional Astronomy
tldr: The author, J. Pond, presents a table of annual variations in the positions
  of several fixed stars, comparing his own observations with those of Dr. Brinkley.
  The study aims to understand the irregularities in the stars' positions, such as
  the'southern deviation,' and contribute to the improvement of astronomical observation
  methods.
