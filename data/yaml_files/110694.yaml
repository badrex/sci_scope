revised_title: Electrolysis of Secondary Compounds and the Constitution of Radicles
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: J. Frederic Daniell investigates the electrolysis of secondary compounds and
  their constitution, focusing on the grouping of chemical elements to form radicles.
  He establishes the principle that inorganic oxy-acid salts should be considered
  compounds of metals or ammonium, and compound anions like chlorine and iodine. Daniell's
  experiments support Davy's hypothesis on the general analogy in the constitution
  of all salts.
