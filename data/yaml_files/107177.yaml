revised_title: Magnetic Properties of Oxides of Iron and Inflammable Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of iron oxides and finds that
  they become magnetic when mixed with inflammable substances and exposed to heat.
  The magnetic properties disappear when the combustible substances are driven off
  by further heating. This study sheds light on the magnetic properties of ores and
  suggests that accurate investigation of this subject may reveal more insights.
