  Natural History
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Cartography
tldr: The author examines Father Hardouin's amendment of a passage in Pliny's Natural
  History and finds that the amendment is based on conjecture without any supporting
  authority. The original text provides accurate information about the length of shadows
  and the height of gnomons in different latitudes, which can be used to determine
  the latitude of various locations in Italy.
