revised_title: Investigation of Odor Accompanying Electricity and Its Dependence on
  a New Substrate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The author, C.F. Sch√∂nbein, investigates the odor accompanying electricity and
  its dependence on a new substrate. He observes that the odor is only released at
  the positive electrode during electrolysis and can be preserved in closed glass
  bottles. The odor is produced by gold and platinum metals and some dilute acids.
  Raising the temperature or adding certain substances to the odor source destroys
  the smell, suggesting a chemical reaction.
