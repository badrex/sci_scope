revised_title: Improving Glass Manufacture for Optical Purposes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, discusses the challenges in creating homogeneous
  glass for optical purposes and describes his experiments in creating a new type
  of glass using borate of lead and silica. This new glass has a high refractive and
  dispersive power, and is less likely to be tarnished or affected by moisture.
