revised_title: Invention and Functioning of a New Hygroscope
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: William Molyneux invents a new hygroscope that measures atmospheric moisture
  by tracking the twisting motion of a rope. The device is sensitive to changes in
  humidity, temperature, and air quality, making it a useful tool for understanding
  weather patterns and the mechanics of muscle motion.
