tldr: The author examines a cartilaginous tumor of the lower jaw and investigates
  the effects of various staining and hardening agents on the tissue's structure and
  appearance. The study reveals that these agents can produce deceptive appearances
  of cellular structures, casting doubt on the interpretation of branched cells in
  hyaline cartilage.
