revised_title: The Impact of Devitalized Cancer Cells on Immunity and Hypersensitivity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: The authors investigate the difference in reactions to cancer implantation after
  inoculating living and mechanically disintegrated cells. They find that disintegrated
  cells do not induce immunity and often cause hypersensitivity in the animals, suggesting
  that the immunizing power of tumors is abolished when cells are mechanically injured.
