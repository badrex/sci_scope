scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This study investigates the recombination of ions at different temperatures
  using a controlled experimental setup. The results show that the recombination decreases
  somewhat rapidly with a rise in temperature but less rapidly as the temperature
  continues to rise. The recombination coefficient is determined at various temperatures,
  providing insights into the behavior of ions under different conditions.
topics:
- Ion recombination
- Temperature effects
- Ionization
- Electrodes
- Recombination coefficient
