revised_title: Investigating the Anomaly in Density Determinations of Nitrogen Gas
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The author examines the discrepancy in density measurements of nitrogen gas
  prepared by different methods, concluding that the anomaly is not due to residual
  oxygen or contamination with lighter gases. The results suggest that the methods
  used for preparing nitrogen gas should be further refined to ensure accurate density
  measurements.
