revised_title: Observations on the Structure and Formation of Crystals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the structure and formation of crystals, specifically salt
  crystals, using a microscope and discovers that they are composed of numerous small
  particles with varying shapes and sizes. He also observes that the crystals dissolve
  into these particles when heated and then re-form when the moisture is removed,
  suggesting that the particles are the building blocks of the crystals.
