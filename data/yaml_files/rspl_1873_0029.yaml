  of the Atmosphere'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: This paper examines the wind patterns of Northern India, focusing on the relationship
  between temperature, vapour-constituent, and atmospheric conditions. The author
  describes the normal wind currents and their annual variations, tracing their origins
  and causes based on local physical changes in the atmosphere. The study covers various
  regions, including the Punjab, Gangetic Plain, Plateau of Pajpootana, Central India,
  Western Bengal, Gangetic Delta, and Assam, providing a comprehensive understanding
  of the region's wind patterns and their seasonal changes.
