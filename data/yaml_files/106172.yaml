scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: Dr. John Ingenhousz and Mr. Walsh conduct experiments on the Torpedo fish's
  electric shocks and discover that the shocks are caused by nerve bundles in the
  fish's soft bodies. They also observe that the fish's electric power seems to be
  stored in transparent gelatinous cylinders within these bundles.
