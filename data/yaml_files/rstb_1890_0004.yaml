scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the structure and relationships of fossil plants from the
  Coal Measures, specifically Lyginodendron Oldhamium and Rachiopteris aspera, and
  demonstrates that they are part of the same fern species. The study also reveals
  that exogenous development of stems occurs in ferns, as well as arborescent Lycopods
  and Calamites, challenging previous beliefs about fern development.
