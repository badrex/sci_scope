revised_title: 'The Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism: A Comprehensive Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism using
  harmonic analysis and concludes that the majority of the variation is likely due
  to causes outside the Earth's surface, based on the comparison of observed and calculated
  vertical force values.
