  Gases and their Catalytic Combustion: A Study of the Relationship between Gas Occlusion
  and Electrical Charge'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Surface Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between gas occlusion and electrical
  charge on a gold surface during the absorption of gases and their catalytic combustion.
  The experiments confirm that a gold surface becomes negatively electrified during
  the catalytic combination of hydrogen and oxygen, and the electrical charge increases
  with the temperature of the surface.
