revised_title: Investigating the Distribution of Scattered Röntgen Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Particle Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of scattered Röntgen radiation and
  find that there is more radiation scattered in the forward direction than in the
  backward direction. This dissymmetry increases as the angle with the primary beam
  decreases. The excess of forward scattered radiation is not explained by the symmetrical
  scattering of the primary beam and may be due to other factors such as irregular
  refractions or deflections of the primary ray.
