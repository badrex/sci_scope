revised_title: Experimental Determination of the Ionisation Potential for Electrons
  in Helium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors experimentally determine the ionisation potential for electrons
  in helium using different methods and compare their results with theoretical values
  from Bohr's theory. They find that the ionisation potential of helium is approximately
  20 volts.
