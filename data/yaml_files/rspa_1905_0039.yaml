revised_title: Investigation of Metal Glass Colors, Metallic Films, and Metallic Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Nanotechnology
tldr: The author investigates the optical properties and molecular arrangement of
  metal glasses, colloidal solutions of metal, and metallic films. They analyze the
  refractive index and absorption coefficient of compound media containing metal spheres
  and molecules, and compare their findings with experimental data. The study concludes
  that the colors of gold ruby glass, silver glass, and copper ruby glass are primarily
  due to the presence of small metal spheres.
