revised_title: On the Mechanics of Percussion and the Nature of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author examines the force of percussion and the relationship between a moving
  body's mass, velocity, and the work it can perform. He argues that the force exerted
  by a moving body is proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity, and
  that this force is best understood as "mechanical force." The author also critiques
  Newton's definition of force and its application in the third law of motion, suggesting
  that there is a need for clearer distinctions between different types of force.
