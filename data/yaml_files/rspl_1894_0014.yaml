revised_title: 'Copper Electrolysis in Vacuo: A Comparative Study of Electrodeposits'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the electrolysis of copper sulphate in vacuo and compare
  the electrodeposits to those formed in air. They find that the deposit is heavier
  in vacuo, suggesting that the presence of oxygen in the air may cause chemical corrosion
  and affect the electrolysis process.
