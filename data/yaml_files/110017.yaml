  Cavities
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy examines the state of water and aeriform matter in cavities
  found in certain crystals. He finds that the fluid is nearly pure water, and the
  gas is mostly nitrogen, existing in a rarefied state. The author suggests that the
  water and silica may have been separated at high temperatures, and that atmospheric
  air may have been absorbed by the water.
