scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author demonstrates that crystal forms from the pyramidal, rhombohedral,
  and prismatic systems can be represented using the symbols of the cubical system,
  showing that these systems are isomorphic. This simplifies the notation and allows
  for easier calculation of angular elements and relations between crystal faces.
