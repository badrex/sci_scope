revised_title: Magnetization and Electrification of Light and Illumination of Magnetic
  Lines of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: Faraday's experiments demonstrate that a polarized light ray can be magnetized
  and electrified when passing through a magnetic field, and that the rotation of
  the ray is dependent on the direction of the magnetic lines of force.
