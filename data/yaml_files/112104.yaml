scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author introduces a new geometry of space, focusing on linear complexes
  and congruencies. He explains how to determine the coordinates of rays and axes,
  and how to represent linear complexes and congruencies using equations. The new
  geometry has applications in optics and mechanics, offering a more comprehensive
  understanding of space and its properties.
