scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Climate
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the positive and relative quantities
  of moisture absorbed from the atmosphere by various substances. The results challenge
  the assumption that materials with high water absorption rates are more effective
  at attracting moisture from the air. The author also discusses the potential health
  benefits of wearing flannel clothing.
