  and Inflexions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents theorems in analytical geometry to determine the envelopes,
  tangents, and inflexions of curves. The theorems are demonstrated using examples
  of conics and quartics, with applications to tangential and inflexional properties.
topics:
- Analytical Geometry
- Envelopes
- Tangents
- Inflexions
