revised_title: Experiments on the Resistance of Bodies Moving in Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the resistance experienced by objects
  moving in fluids, specifically water, and investigates the relationship between
  the resistance, velocity, and area of the object. The results show that the resistance
  varies as the square of the velocity and as the area of the object.
