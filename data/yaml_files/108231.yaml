revised_title: Improvements in Reflecting Telescope Construction
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomical Instrumentation & Optics
tldr: The author describes his experiments on improving the reflecting telescope,
  focusing on the materials and techniques used in constructing large, high-quality
  specula. He discusses the challenges of working with speculum metal and suggests
  a method for combining multiple castings to create a more robust reflecting surface,
  which he successfully tested on a three-foot aperture speculum.
