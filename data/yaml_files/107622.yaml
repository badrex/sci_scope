revised_title: Investigating Parallax and Aberration Effects on Star Positions
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author presents observations made with the eight-foot astronomical circle
  at Trinity College Observatory in Dublin, focusing on the effects of parallax and
  aberration on the positions of certain fixed stars. The results support the explanation
  of observed discrepancies by parallax and provide insights into the constant of
  aberration, which has important implications for the theory of light.
