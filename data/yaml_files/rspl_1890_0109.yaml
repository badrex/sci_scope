revised_title: On the Screening Effect of Electric and Magnetic Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the screening effects of electric and magnetic forces
  on varying frequencies and materials, demonstrating that the efficiency of screening
  increases with higher frequencies and electric conductivity, and decreases with
  magnetic susceptibility.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Screening
- Electric Conductivity
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Alternating Currents
- Electromagnetic Induction
