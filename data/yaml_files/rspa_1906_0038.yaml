revised_title: On the Coefficient of Viscous Traction and its Relation to Viscosity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Rheology
tldr: The author investigates the coefficient of viscous traction and its relation
  to viscosity by examining the flow of pitch and other materials using the torsional
  method. The results show that the rate of flow is not strictly proportional to the
  applied force, and a coefficient of viscous traction is introduced to describe this
  relationship.

- Viscous Traction
- Flow of Pitch
- Viscosity
