tldr: This study investigates the atmospheric electric potential at Kew from selected
  days between 1898 and 1904, analyzing the mean monthly and annual values of the
  potential gradient, as well as the effects of diurnal inequality, non-cyclic changes,
  and meteorological factors on the results.
topics:
- Atmospheric electricity
- Electric potential
- Electrometry
- Potential gradient
- Meteorological influences
