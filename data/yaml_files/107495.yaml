scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates the formation of mists over bodies of water, particularly
  rivers and lakes, and concludes that the temperature difference between the water
  and the surrounding air, along with the properties of water, are the main factors
  contributing to mist formation. The study also refutes the idea that mist can form
  solely due to heat loss by radiation from the air or the water itself.
