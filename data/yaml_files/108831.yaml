scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Calculus
tldr: The author expands upon the Calculus of Symbols, exploring methods for resolving
  functions of non-commutative symbols into binomial factors, finding the highest
  common internal divisor of two functions, and applying the binomial theorem. The
  author also investigates two new forms of the binomial theorem and provides a rule
  for multiplying linear factors of non-commutative symbols.
