scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Dynamics
tldr: Signor Cassini observes a permanent spot on Jupiter and calculates its revolution
  period to be approximately 9 hours and 56 minutes. He also predicts the spot's return
  to the same position and invites other observers to verify his findings, which could
  potentially help in determining the longitude of remote places on Earth.
