tldr: Thomas Young presents a finite and exact expression for the refraction of an
  atmosphere similar to Earth's. He demonstrates that using the cube of the square
  root of the density accurately represents the atmosphere, resulting in a direct
  equation for refraction that closely aligns with existing tables and the Nautical
  Almanac.
