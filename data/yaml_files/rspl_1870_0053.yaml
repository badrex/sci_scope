tldr: The author presents the results of seven years of magnetic observations at Stonyhurst
  College Observatory, from April 1863 to March 1870. The study focuses on the semiannual
  inequality in the earth's magnetic elements and their variations over time. The
  observations reveal a slight increase in the horizontal force during summer months
  and a small difference in the intensity of the earth's magnetic force with the sun's
  distance.
