revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Striae as Local Aggregations of Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the physical nature of striae in stratified discharges
  and provide experimental evidence that they are local aggregations of matter rather
  than merely special electrical conditions of the gas.

- Stratified Discharges
- Crookes' Green Phosphorescence
- Electrical Discharge Phenomena
- Vacuum Discharges
