revised_title: Investigations on the Motor Roots of the Brachial Plexus and the Dilator
  Nerve of the Iris
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neuroanatomy
tldr: The author investigates the motor roots of the brachial plexus and discovers
  a connection between the second dorsal nerve and the dilator nerve of the iris.
  Experiments on monkeys reveal that stimulating the second dorsal nerve root consistently
  causes the pupil to dilate, indicating that this nerve is responsible for controlling
  the iris' dilator fibers.
