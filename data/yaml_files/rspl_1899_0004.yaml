revised_title: Effects of Strain on Micro-Metallurgical Structure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: This article investigates the behavior of metal grains under strain using micro-metallurgical
  techniques. The authors observe the formation of slip bands on the surface of strained
  metals, which they attribute to slips along cleavage or gliding planes. These slip
  bands change the appearance of the metal surface and provide insight into the deformation
  process of metals.
