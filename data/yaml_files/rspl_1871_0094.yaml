revised_title: Decomposition of Paraffins Under Heat and Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of heat and pressure on paraffins, finding
  that they can be decomposed into liquid hydrocarbons. They also discover that the
  readiness of this decomposition depends on the complexity of the paraffin's constitution.
topics:
- Chemical Decomposition
- Heat and Pressure
- Hydrocarbons
- Paraffins
