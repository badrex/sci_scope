revised_title: 'Isomeric Interchange in Benzenediazonium Hydroxides: The Transformation
  of s-Trichloro- and s-Tribromo-Benzenediazonium Hydroxides'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The authors investigate the isomeric change in benzene derivatives, specifically
  the interchange of halogen and hydroxyl in benzenediazonium hydroxides. They study
  the transformation of s-trichloro- and s-tribromo-benzenediazonium hydroxides into
  hydroxybenzene derivatives, providing insights into the mechanisms of intramolecular
  change and the role of catalysts in these reactions.
