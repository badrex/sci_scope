scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Separation Techniques
tldr: The author explores the concept of liquid diffusion and its potential applications
  in the field of chemical analysis. He introduces the idea of colloids and crystalloids,
  and discusses the process of dialysis as a method of separation using liquid diffusion.
  The author also demonstrates the effectiveness of dialysis in separating mixtures
  of crystalloids and colloids.
