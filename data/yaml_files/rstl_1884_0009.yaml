revised_title: Investigating the Connection between Chemical Constitution, Physiological
  Action, and Antagonism of Ammonium Salts and Compound Ammonias
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of ammonium salts and compound ammonias
  on the physiological actions and antagonism in various organisms. They find that
  different ammonium salts have varying effects on muscle and nerve responses, and
  that compound ammonias also exhibit distinct actions when uncombined with an acid
  radical.
