revised_title: 'Erratum: Electromotive Force and Spark Distance in Air'

scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: This article contains an erratum regarding the measurement of the electromotive
  force required to produce a spark in air between parallel metal plates at different
  distances. The original statement about Mr. Brunel's involvement in the design of
  the Bute Docks and Cardiff docks is found to be erroneous.
