  Frog Eggs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Development
tldr: Sir Everard Home examines the role of fat in the intestine of tadpoles and the
  use of yolk in the formation of the embryo in frog eggs. He observes that the fat
  is absorbed during the metamorphosis of tadpoles into frogs, similar to the absorption
  of yolk in a hen's egg. He also notes that the proportion of fat in different eggs
  corresponds to the hardness of the bones that will be formed in the developing organism.
