scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for determining when the roots of a cubic equation
  are impossible by analyzing the relationship between the squares and products of
  the equation's terms. This method is based on the properties of real quantities
  and can be used to identify when roots are not real numbers.
