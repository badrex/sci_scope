scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author analyzes eight years of barometric pressure data from three stations
  in the British Isles to determine the mean directions and distribution of isobaric
  lines. The study reveals that the isobaric lines can be represented by parallel
  straight lines, and provides insights into the annual variations of barometric pressure
  and wind directions.
