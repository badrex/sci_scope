revised_title: On the Theory of Long Waves and Bore Dynamics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of long waves and bores in water, determining
  the conditions for stationary waves and the velocity of water waves in still water.
  The study also considers the energy conservation in bores and the effect of varying
  gravity on wave dynamics.
