scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Captain W. de W. Abney describes a method for creating monochromatic images
  using a prism and lens system. This technique can be used to photograph sources
  of light with specific wavelengths, providing valuable information about the nature
  of the light source. Abney also discusses the potential applications of this method,
  such as studying the solar corona during an eclipse.
