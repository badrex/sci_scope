revised_title: The Extinction of the Irish Elk
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: Thomas Weaver argues that the remains of the Irish Elk are not of antediluvian
  origin, but rather the animal lived and flourished in Ireland at a relatively recent
  time. He attributes the extinction of the species to continuous persecution by its
  enemies and local environmental factors, rather than a global catastrophe.
