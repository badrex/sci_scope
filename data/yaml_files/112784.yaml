revised_title: Nuclear Action in Supersaturated Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Solutions
tldr: The author investigates the conditions under which nuclei act in separating
  salt from supersaturated saline solutions and explores the effects of low temperatures
  on these solutions. The study reveals that the nuclear action is influenced by the
  presence of foreign matter on the surface of the substances and the formation of
  films, which play a crucial role in the separation and crystallization process.
