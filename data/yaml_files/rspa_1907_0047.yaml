revised_title: Two Modes of Condensation of Water Vapour on Glass Surfaces and their
  Analogy with James Thomson's Curve of Transition from Gas to Liquid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Surface Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates two modes of condensation of water vapor on glass surfaces
  and their analogy with James Thomson's curve of transition from gas to liquid. The
  study reveals that a relatively wet surface can act as a drying agent to a drier
  surface, and that the presence of condensed vapor or liquid provides a nucleus for
  further condensation.
