revised_title: Mechanical Effects and Electrical Disturbance in Dionsea muscipula
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanical effects and electrical disturbance in
  the leaf of Dionsea muscipula, discovering that successive excitations lead to a
  visible movement and eventual closure of the leaf. They also find that the delay
  between excitation and effect decreases as the extent of the effect increases, suggesting
  a summation process in plants.
