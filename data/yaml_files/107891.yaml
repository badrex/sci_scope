revised_title: Anatomical Study of the Zariffa's Stomach
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This study examines the stomach structure and function of the Zariffa, a ruminant
  animal, and compares it to the bullock and sheep. The Zariffa's second stomach cavity
  lacks the deep cells found in other ruminants, as its cud is already moist enough
  to pass through without needing re-moistening.
