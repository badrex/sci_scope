scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author discusses the calculus of functions, focusing on linear functional
  equations of the first order with constant coefficients. They demonstrate how these
  equations can be solved using series or definite integrals and extend the methods
  to higher-order equations with variable coefficients.
