revised_title: Observations on the Gland-Cells of Dionaea muscipula during Secretion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: 'The authors study the changes in gland-cells of Dionaea muscipula during the
  secretion process. They observe four distinct periods: resting, secretory, absorptive,
  and recovery. The gland-cells undergo structural changes, such as the movement of
  protoplasm and the formation of crystals, during these periods.'
