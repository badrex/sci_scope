revised_title: 'Evolution of the Vertebral Column in Fishes: A Study on Sklerotomes
  and Myotomes'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Vertebrate Anatomy
tldr: The authors investigate the evolution of the vertebral column in fishes, focusing
  on the role of sklerotomes and myotomes. They propose a new understanding of vertebral
  formation, explaining the S-shaped curving and the presence of multiple cartilaginous
  pieces in each segment. They also differentiate between chorda-centra and arch-centra,
  which represent two distinct modes of development.
