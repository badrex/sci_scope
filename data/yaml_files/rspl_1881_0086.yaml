revised_title: On the Electromagnetic Rotations in Magnetized Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic rotations produced in liquids by
  axial electric currents in magnetized electrolytes. The rotations are observed to
  be opposite in direction at the two ends of the voltaic helix, strongest at the
  poles, and null at the center of the tube. The phenomenon is not limited to paramagnetic
  substances and is not affected by the magnetic character of the liquid.
