revised_title: 'The Pancreatic Action on Fat and Starch: Discovering Pancreatin'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the unique action of the pancreas on fats and starch,
  discovering that it forms a permanent emulsion with fat, altering its hydration
  and molecular condition. The pancreas also converts starch into glycose. The study
  leads to the development of a method to extract and preserve the active principles
  of the pancreas for laboratory experiments and medical use, called 'pancreatine'.
