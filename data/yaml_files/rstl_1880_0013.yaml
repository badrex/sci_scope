revised_title: 'On the Motion of Two Spheres in a Fluid: A Study of Fluid Dynamics'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the motion of two spheres in a fluid, focusing on the
  velocity potential and the image of sources and sinks within the spheres. They find
  that the image of a source is a positive source at the inverse point, along with
  a negative line sink stretching from this point to the center of the sphere. This
  research contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the motion of rigid
  bodies in fluids.
