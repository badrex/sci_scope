revised_title: Experiments on the Quality and Composition of Wootz Steel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author examines five cakes of wootz steel and analyzes their differences
  in appearance, composition, and forging properties. The study reveals variations
  in grain size, density, and the presence of malleable iron, suggesting that the
  quality of wootz steel can be influenced by the manufacturing process.
