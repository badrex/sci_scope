tldr: The author presents four clinical cases of secondary nerve suture and examines
  the microstructure of the nerves. The results indicate that early return of sensation
  after suture is due to restored conductivity, while the slow return of motion is
  attributed to trophic changes in muscles. Microscopic examination reveals the development
  of young nerve fibers in both peripheral and central segments, suggesting that regeneration
  occurs even without direct reunion of the nerve ends.
