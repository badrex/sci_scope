tldr: Smithson Tennant analyzes the composition of emery, a mineral used for grinding
  and polishing, and finds it contains argillaceous earth, silex, and iron. The composition
  is similar to that of diamond spar, suggesting that emery is a related substance
  with a slightly higher iron content.
