revised_title: A Novel Device for Composing Two Harmonic Curves
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Instrumentation
tldr: The authors describe a mechanical instrument that composes two harmonic curves
  by combining the motions of two spindles, a crank, and a tubular glass pen. The
  resulting curve represents the pressure on the tympanic membrane when exposed to
  two vibrating tones. The device can be used to study consonances and their effects
  on the ear.
