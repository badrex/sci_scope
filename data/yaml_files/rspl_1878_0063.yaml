revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Electric Discharge in Exhausted Tubes
  with the Chloride of Silver Battery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry
tldr: De La Rue and Muller investigate the electric discharge in exhausted tubes using
  a chloride of silver battery. They observe various appearances of the discharge
  in residual gases at different pressures and currents, and study the resistance
  and potential differences in the tubes. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of the cause of stratification produced by the electric discharge in vacuum tubes.
