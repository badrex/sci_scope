revised_title: Anatomical and Physiological Examination of Efferent Fibres in the
  Lumbo-Sacral Plexus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the distribution and function of efferent fibers in the
  lumbo-sacral plexus of various animals, including Macacus, frog, rat, rabbit, cat,
  and dog. The study reveals significant individual variation in the anatomical and
  physiological constitution of these fibers, leading to the recognition of a 'pre-axial'
  and 'post-axial' class of innervation for each muscle and movement.
