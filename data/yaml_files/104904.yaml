tldr: James Parsons discusses the use of Lycoperdon, or puff-ball, as a potential
  remedy for stopping blood after amputations. He cites experiments conducted by Mons.
  la Fosse, which showed successful results in stopping blood flow in horses. The
  Royal Academy of Sciences also attested to the effectiveness of this method. Parsons
  recommends further experimentation on quadrupeds before attempting it on humans.
