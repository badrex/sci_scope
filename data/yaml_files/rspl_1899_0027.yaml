revised_title: The Determination of the Characteristic of Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the excitability of living matter and nerve stimulation
  using a condenser with varying capacity and voltage. They propose the concept of
  a 'characteristic' to measure the optimum stimulation gradient for a specific tissue,
  which can be used to determine the efficiency of excitation and characterize the
  tissue.
