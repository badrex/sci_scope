revised_title: In-depth Study of Liver Structure, Development, and Functions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure, development, and functions of the liver in
  various vertebrate classes, focusing on the ducts and their role in bile secretion.
  The study suggests that the liver's parenchyma forms independently and that the
  hepatic cells may not necessarily produce bile, instead, the ultimate ducts play
  a crucial role in bile formation.
