revised_title: Inhibitory Excitation in the Medulla Oblongata and its Effects on the
  Vagus Nerves and Blood Vessels
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the inhibitory effects of excitations in the medulla
  oblongata through the glossopharyngeal nerve on the vagus nerves and blood vessels.
  They observe that these inhibitions affect the origins of vagus fibers, the ends
  of vagus fibers that control respiration and heart movements, and the blood vessel
  regulation center in the medulla. This research sheds light on the complex interactions
  between the nervous and cardiovascular systems.
