scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences

tldr: The author, Pierre Beron, investigates the causes of terrestrial magnetism and
  attributes them to thermo-electric currents. He proposes that the magnetic needle
  acts as a thermoscope, indicating temperature differences in heterothermal regions.
  Beron connects magnetism to climatology, stating that the cause of the anomalous
  distribution of heat during each season and month is due to geographical surface
  conformation and the daily and annual movements of the planet.
