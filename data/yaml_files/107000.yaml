revised_title: Improvement of Hyperbolic Logarithm Computation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author improves the computation of the hyperbolic logarithm of 10 by transforming
  the series used in previous calculations. The new series converges faster and allows
  for easier numerical calculations, making it more efficient for mathematicians and
  scientists.
