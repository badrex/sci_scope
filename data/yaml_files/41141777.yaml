tldr: The author describes extensive experiments conducted with an invariable pendulum
  at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and Port Bowen. They detail the setup, equipment,
  and observations made, as well as the challenges faced due to weather and temperature
  fluctuations. The results of these experiments were used to compare the accuracy
  of timekeeping at the two locations.
