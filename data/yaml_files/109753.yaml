revised_title: The Influence of the Brain on the Generation of Animal Heat

scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Neurobiology
tldr: B. C. Brodie investigates the relationship between the brain and the generation
  of animal heat. He finds that when the brain's functions are suspended, no heat
  is generated, and the animal cools more rapidly than a dead one. However, when the
  animal's sensibility is restored, the power of generating heat returns. This suggests
  that the temperature of warm-blooded animals is significantly influenced by the
  nervous system, but the exact nature of this connection remains unclear.
