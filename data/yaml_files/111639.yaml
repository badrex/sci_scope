revised_title: The Interruption of Voltaic Discharge in Vacuo by Magnetic Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author investigates the effect of magnetic force on voltaic discharge in
  a vacuum and discovers that the discharge can be entirely arrested by the magnetic
  force, providing a significant insight into the interaction between electricity
  and magnetism.
