revised_title: Innovative Design and Construction of a Refracting Telescope with a
  Fluid Concave Lens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Astronomical Instrumentation
tldr: Peter Barlow describes the construction and preliminary experiments of a refracting
  telescope with a fluid concave lens, with an aperture of 7.8 inches. The telescope
  has a clear advantage in its smooth and accurate movements, making it easy to manage
  by a single person. Barlow also discusses the design choices and adjustments made
  to optimize the telescope's performance, including the distance between the lenses
  and the focal length.
