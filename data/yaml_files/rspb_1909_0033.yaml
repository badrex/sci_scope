tldr: Nuttall and Hadwen discovered that trypanblau and trypanrot are effective treatments
  for canine piroplasmosis and have a prompt effect on the parasite in bovine piroplasviosis.
  The drugs directly affect the parasites, causing them to disappear and reappear
  in small numbers before eventually disappearing completely. This discovery has practical
  implications for treating diseases that were previously untreatable and may lead
  to further advancements in combating other piroplasmosis infections in animals.
