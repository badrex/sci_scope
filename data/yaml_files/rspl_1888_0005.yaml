revised_title: Hydraulic Problems on Cross-Sections of Pipes and Channels
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydraulics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the optimal cross-section for pipes and channels to
  maximize hydraulic mean depth, concluding that a catenary curve with a specific
  perimeter provides a favorable hydraulic mean depth for open channels with fluctuating
  contents.
