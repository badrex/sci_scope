revised_title: Influence of Temperature and Weight on Muscle Contraction Latency
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Muscle Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature and weight on the latent
  period of muscle contraction. The authors found that increasing temperature and
  weight both increase the latency, with temperature having a more significant impact.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of muscle physiology and nerve conduction.
