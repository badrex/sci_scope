revised_title: Investigating the Relationship Between Metal Densities and Colors in
  Glass
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author explores the relationship between the specific gravities of metals
  and their colors when combined with glass. Through a series of experiments, he demonstrates
  that metals with higher densities produce more red hues, while those with lower
  densities produce other colors such as orange, yellow, green, and blue.
