revised_title: 'On the Viscosity of Gases at High Exhaustions: A New Apparatus and
  Experimental Findings'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author presents a new apparatus and experimental findings on the viscosity
  of gases at high exhaustions, challenging Maxwell's theory that the coefficient
  of viscosity should be independent of gas density. The research demonstrates that
  the coefficient of viscosity decreases at higher vacuums, providing valuable insights
  into molecular physics and gas behavior in high vacuums.
