tldr: The author investigates properties of numbers related to Fermat's Theorem of
  Polygonal Numbers, focusing on the division of numbers into 4 squares. The paper
  explores the connections between these properties and the first and second branches
  of Fermat's theorem, as well as the implications for triangular and polygonal numbers.
