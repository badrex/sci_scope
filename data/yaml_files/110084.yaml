revised_title: Optical Deception in the Appearance of Spokes of a Wheel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Dr. P.M. Roget explains an optical deception that occurs when viewing a rotating
  wheel through vertical apertures, such as a palisade or Venetian window-blind. The
  spokes of the wheel appear curved, with the degree of curvature increasing as the
  spokes move away from the vertical. The author refers to the principle of retinal
  impression and demonstrates that the apparent form of each spoke is a curve formed
  by the intersection of the revolving and advancing radius with the immovable interval
  between the bars.
