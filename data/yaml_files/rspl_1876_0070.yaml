revised_title: Investigating the Perception of Shades and Shadows
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the perception of shades and shadows by examining the
  intensity of shadows produced by two candles and comparing them to the shades in
  a print. They find that the apparent illumination on a ruled surface varies inversely
  with the square of the intensity of the light source.
