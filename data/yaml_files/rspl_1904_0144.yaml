  Small Inductances and Capacities
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author presents a new instrument for measuring the length of long electric
  waves, as well as small inductances and capacities. The device uses a neon vacuum
  tube detector and a closed circuit wave-meter, allowing for accurate and quick measurement
  of oscillation constants and overcoming issues with previous wave-meters.
