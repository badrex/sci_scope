revised_title: Investigating the Behavior of Short-Period Atmospheric Pressure Variations
  Across the Earth's Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate
tldr: The authors analyze the behavior of short-period atmospheric pressure variations
  across various regions on Earth, identifying distinct types of pressure changes
  and their geographical distribution. They classify these types based on their similarity
  to the pressure variations in India and Cordoba, and discuss the implications of
  these findings for understanding global atmospheric patterns.
