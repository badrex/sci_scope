revised_title: On the Secondary Mode of Division in Vibrating Plates and the Influence
  of the Surrounding Medium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibrations
tldr: Faraday investigates the secondary mode of division in vibrating plates and
  the influence of the surrounding medium on the formation of patterns by fine powders.
  He demonstrates that the currents established in the air around the plate play a
  significant role in the movement and accumulation of particles at the centers of
  oscillation.
