revised_title: 'The Energy of Röntgen Rays: Elimination of Errors and Effect of Reflected
  Cathode Rays'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors investigate the energy of Röntgen rays using various experimental
  methods and discuss the elimination of errors, such as unsteady discharge tube currents
  and potential gradients. They also explore the effect of reflected cathode rays
  on the results, finding that the energy of Röntgen rays is not significantly affected
  by this phenomenon.
topics:
- Röntgen Rays
- Cathode Rays
- Ionization
- Experimental Errors
- Energy Absorption
