revised_title: The Production of a 'Dark Cross' in the Field of Electro-magnetic Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author demonstrates the production of a 'dark cross' in the field of electro-magnetic
  radiation using a paper disc and polarizers. The phenomenon occurs when the disc
  is tilted or displaced, and the cross's movement can be used to study the rotation
  of the plane of polarization and the effects of magnetic fields.
