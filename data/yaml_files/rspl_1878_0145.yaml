tldr: This article examines the anatomical differences and evolutionary changes in
  the pelvis of mammals, comparing them to reptiles and other vertebrates. It discusses
  the distinct features of the mammalian pelvis, such as the ilium's oblique direction
  and the changes in the symphysial union of the ischia. The author also compares
  the pelvis of various mammal species, including Monotremes, Ornithorhynchus, Echidna,
  and other mammals, and contrasts them with reptiles and birds.
