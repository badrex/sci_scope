revised_title: 'On the Ionisation of Atmospheric Air: Experiments and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the ionization of atmospheric air and discovers that
  there is a continual leakage of electricity from a charged conductor through dust-free
  air. This leakage is independent of the potential and is approximately proportional
  to the pressure, suggesting the presence of ions in the atmosphere.
