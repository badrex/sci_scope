revised_title: On Waves Produced by a Single Impulse in Water and Dispersive Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Wave Phenomena & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the waves produced by a single impulse in water and
  dispersive media, focusing on wave propagation, wave velocity, and group velocity.
  The study includes various examples, such as light in a dispersive medium, capillary
  gravitational waves, and waves of flexure in a uniform elastic medium.
topics:
- Wave Propagation
- Wave Velocity
- Group Velocity
- Dispersive Media
- Water Waves
