revised_title: Determining Geographical Longitude Using Falling Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteor Astronomy & Celestial Navigation
tldr: George Lynn proposes a method to determine geographical longitude by observing
  the appearance of falling stars, or meteors, and comparing their tracks among the
  stars. This method could potentially be used to determine the difference in longitude
  between two places, without the need for a telescope.
