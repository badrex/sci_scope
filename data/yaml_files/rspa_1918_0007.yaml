revised_title: The Electrostatic Problem of a Conducting Sphere in a Spherical Cavity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The authors investigate the electrostatic problem of a conducting sphere within
  a spherical cavity, providing mathematical formulas for calculating the capacity,
  potential, and attractive force between the spheres. The study has implications
  for understanding the behavior of electrodes and capacitors in electrical systems.
