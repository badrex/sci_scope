scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Developmental Biology
tldr: Dr. Martin Barry explores the process of fissiparous generation and the role
  of the hyaline substance in cell reproduction. He suggests that the hyaline substance,
  found in cells, is responsible for the transmission of properties from cell to cell
  and plays a crucial role in cell division. This process is observed in the development
  of the ovum and the changes in blood corpuscles, as well as in the formation of
  various tissues and organs.
