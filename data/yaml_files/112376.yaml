scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author compares the granites of Cornwall and Devon with those of Leinster
  and Mourne, analyzing their composition and identifying the presence of albite,
  orthoclase, and two types of mica. The study suggests that granites can be classified
  into two distinct classes based on their geological and mineralogical characteristics.
