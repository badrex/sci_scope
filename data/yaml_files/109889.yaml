tldr: Dr. Johnson proposes a new genus, Glossopora, for the animals Hirudo complanata
  and Hirudo stagnalis, due to their distinct features. He also suggests that other
  species, such as Hirudo circulans and Hirudo crenata, belong to this new genus.
  Glossopora have a unique projectile tubular tongue and abdominal pouch for their
  young. They feed on water snails and reproduce within the abdominal pouch.
