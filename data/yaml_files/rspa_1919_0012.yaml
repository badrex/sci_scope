  Region
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of various elements, such as copper, aluminum,
  zinc, carbon, iron, tin, thallium, lead, nickel, cobalt, and cadmium, in the extreme
  ultra-violet region using a vacuum arc spectrograph. They describe the apparatus
  and methods used to obtain the spectra and discuss the challenges faced during the
  experiments.
