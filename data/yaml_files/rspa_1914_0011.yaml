revised_title: The Influence of Crystal Constituents on X-ray Spectrometer Spectra
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates how the constituents of a crystal affect the form of
  the spectrum in an X-ray spectrometer. They demonstrate that the crystal's atomic
  structure influences the absorption of X-rays, leading to variations in the relative
  intensities of different parts of the spectrum.
