revised_title: 'Flame Spectra at High Temperatures: Part I - Oxy-Hydrogen Blow-Pipe
  Spectra'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the spectra of flames at high temperatures using the
  oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe and discovers new spectra of elements and compounds in the
  ultra-violet region. They also develop a convenient method for observing spectra
  with the oxy-hydrogen flame and describe numerous spectra they photographed for
  further study.
