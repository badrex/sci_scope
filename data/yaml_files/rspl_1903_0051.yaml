tldr: The paper discusses the theory of symmetrical optical objectives and their applications.
  It explores the relations between the aberrations of a lens system with a front
  stop and the compound system formed by two such systems symmetrically arranged.
  The author also investigates the conditions for correcting spherical aberration,
  coma, astigmatism, and distortion in these systems.
