scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Respiratory Medicine
tldr: The author investigates the effects of dividing the nerves of the lungs and
  subjecting them to voltaic electricity. He finds that dividing the nerves causes
  difficulty in breathing and death due to suffocation, while applying voltaic electricity
  restores lung function, unless it causes inflammation.
