revised_title: Observations on the Epiploon and the Role of Fat in the Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the epiploon, a double membrane
  covering animal entrails filled with fat. They observe that fat is stored in small
  sacs within the membrane and is transported to the body via adipose vessels. The
  author argues that fat does not form accidentally from blood vapors and its primary
  function is not to generate heat, but rather to neutralize the acidity of blood
  and serous fluids, thus preventing diseases related to sharp humors.
