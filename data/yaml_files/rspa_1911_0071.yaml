revised_title: The Transformation and Properties of a Gaseous Condensable Explosive
  Compound Produced from Carbon Disulphide Vapour by Silent Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The authors investigate the transformation of a gaseous explosive compound produced
  from carbon disulphide vapour by silent electric discharge. They study the conditions
  and properties of the compound, including its transformation into a non-volatile
  solid, and the effect of various factors on its formation and behavior.
