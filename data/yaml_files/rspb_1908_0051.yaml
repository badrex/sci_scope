  Temperature Curve in the Animal Body
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author discusses methods for continuous and quasi-continuous registration
  of the diurnal temperature curve in the animal body, focusing on thermo-electric
  methods and photographic recording. He describes the improvements in apparatus and
  technology that have facilitated these investigations, such as the D'Arsonval galvanometer
  and the thermostat. The author also highlights the importance of the vaso-motor
  center in temperature regulation.
