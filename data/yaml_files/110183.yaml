scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie investigates the magnetic influence of solar rays on
  various materials, including magnetized needles, glass, and copper. He finds that
  magnetized needles are more affected by the sun's rays than non-magnetized ones,
  and that the effect is not solely due to heat. The study also explores the effects
  of different colored rays and temperatures on the needles' vibrations.
