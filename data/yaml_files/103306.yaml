revised_title: Improvement of Approximation Method for Extracting Roots of Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Numerical Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The author presents an improved method for approximating the roots of equations
  in numbers, expanding on Dr. Halley's previous work. This method is applicable to
  various expressions, including binomials, trinomials, logarithms, and areas of curves,
  making it more general and versatile.
