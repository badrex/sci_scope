revised_title: The Influence of Concentration on the Spectra of Luminous Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the effect of concentration on the spectra of luminous
  gases, specifically focusing on the broadening of lines in the spectra of sodium
  and lithium. Experiments reveal that the addition of large quantities of one element
  to a source containing another element does not cause the broadening of lines, suggesting
  that temporary associations of atoms are not the explanation for these phenomena.
