revised_title: 'Directive Antennas: A New Approach to Unsymmetrical Hertzian Oscillators'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author investigates the properties of bent electric oscillators, also known
  as directive antennas, and demonstrates how they radiate unequally in different
  directions. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior
  of antennas in wireless telegraphy and aligns with experimental results.
