tldr: This paper explores the properties of Fermat's Theorem of Polygonal Numbers,
  demonstrating how the series can be combined and divided into squares. The author
  shows that certain terms in the series can be divided into four squares, with specific
  differences between the roots, and provides methods for finding the roots of all
  terms in the series.
