scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author, W. Whewell, investigates the diurnal inequality of tide heights,
  particularly at Plymouth and Singapore, and examines the mean level of the sea.
  He explores the relationship between the moon's declination and the observed heights
  of tides, and discusses the diurnal inequality at various locations, including Liverpool,
  Bristol, and Leith. The study also considers extreme cases of diurnal inequality
  and the mean height of the sea.
