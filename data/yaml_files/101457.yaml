tldr: The author reports on the successful trials of Campani's new optic glasses in
  Italy, which allowed for clear vision at great distances. The Great Duke of Tuscany
  and Prince Leopold found these glasses to be superior to their own, enabling them
  to distinguish people up to 4 leagues away. The improved length and aperture of
  these telescopes are expected to be even more significant.
