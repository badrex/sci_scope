scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Heredity
tldr: Francis Galton's experiments in pangenesis involve breeding rabbits from a pure
  variety with alien blood transfused into their circulation. The results show that
  the offspring's appearance and heredity are influenced by the transfused blood,
  supporting the theory of pangenesis.
