revised_title: Demonstration of a Law of Motion in the Case of a Body Deflected by
  Two Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a law of motion that explains the behavior of a body deflected
  by two forces tending constantly to two fixed points. This law is essential for
  understanding the motions of celestial bodies with gravity towards two different
  centers.
