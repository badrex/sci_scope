revised_title: A Direct Comparison Method for Mutual Inductance and Resistance Using
  Two-Phase Alternating Currents
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The authors describe a method for directly comparing mutual inductance and resistance
  using two-phase alternating currents. They explain the ideal case and discuss practical
  considerations, such as obtaining pure sine wave-forms and accounting for harmonics.
  The method provides a means for evaluating the ohm and testing the accuracy of mutual
  and self-inductances.
