revised_title: A Study on the Constitution of Resins and Their Metamorphoses
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author examines the constitution of various resins, including sagapenum,
  galbanum, opoponax, assafcetida, euphorbium, elemi, bdellium, and benzoin. He investigates
  their chemical reactions and metamorphoses under different conditions, such as heat,
  dilute carbonated alkalies, quicklime, and oxide of lead. The study aims to understand
  the rational constitution of resins and their transformations.
