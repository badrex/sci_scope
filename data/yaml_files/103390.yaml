tldr: The article describes two extraordinary cases of surgical recovery. In the first
  case, a man experiences a severe leg injury, leading to the eventual loss of his
  leg. Despite this, his body regenerates flesh and bone, eventually healing the wound.
  In the second case, a woman suffers a boar attack, resulting in a fistula that discharges
  half-digested food. Despite this, she maintains her ability to have bowel movements.
