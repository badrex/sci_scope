revised_title: Determination of the Atomic Weight of Radium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Radiochemistry
tldr: The author describes the process of extracting radium chloride from barium-radium
  chloride and determines the atomic weight of radium through a series of systematic
  fractional crystallizations and chemical reactions. The results provide a more accurate
  understanding of radium's place in the system of elements.
