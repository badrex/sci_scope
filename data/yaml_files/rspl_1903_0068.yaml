scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The authors explore the maximum order of irreducible covariants in a system
  of binary forms, proving that it can be determined by considering covariants, their
  products, and the coefficients of the quantic in question.
