scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author explores the algebraic and transcendental aspects of elliptic functions,
  focusing on the transformation theory and modular equations. The study aims to extend
  the algebraic theory to any value of the parameter n, providing a deeper understanding
  of elliptic functions and their properties.
