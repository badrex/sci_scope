revised_title: On Electrical Evaporation and Its Similarity to Ordinary Evaporation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the process of electrical evaporation and its similarities
  to ordinary evaporation. He demonstrates that the passage of an electric current
  affects the molecular motion of metals, causing molecules to be removed from the
  metal's sphere of attraction and fly off towards the negative pole. This process
  is similar to evaporation by heat and is more rapid in a vacuum.
