revised_title: Comparing Sun-spot Areas, Toronto Temperature Ranges, and Prague Declination
  Ranges
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors compare sun-spot areas, Toronto temperature ranges, and Prague declination
  ranges, finding similarities in the positions of maximum apparent inequalities.
  They suggest that while this likeness does not conclusively prove a connection,
  it indicates a potential physical link between these phenomena.
topics:
- Sunspots
- Temperature Ranges
- Declination Ranges
- Solar Physics
- Magnetic Declination
