scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the structure and physiological significance of root-nodules
  in Myrica gale. It finds that the nodules are formed by the action of bacteria and
  are involved in nitrogen assimilation, adding Myrica to the list of non-leguminous
  plants capable of nitrogen fixation.
