revised_title: The Enzymatic Liquefaction of Gelatine by Bacteria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the liquefaction of gelatine by bacteria and conclude
  that it is caused by a soluble enzyme. They also find that the enzyme is more active
  when formed in meat broth than in gelatine itself.
