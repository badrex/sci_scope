revised_title: 'The Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism: A Study of Atmospheric
  Oscillations and Conductivity'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and concludes
  that it is caused by electric currents circulating in the upper regions of the atmosphere.
  The study also suggests that the necessary electromotive forces are supplied by
  the permanent forces of terrestrial magnetism acting on the bodily motion of masses
  of conducting air which cut through its lines of force. The author further explores
  the connection between barometric and magnetic changes, and the possible ionizing
  power of solar radiation.
