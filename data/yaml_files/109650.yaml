scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Water Chemistry
tldr: Alexander Marcet analyzes the waters of the Dead Sea and River Jordan, discovering
  that they contain high levels of muriates of lime, magnesia, and soda. The water's
  intense salinity prevents the growth of both animals and plants. The similarity
  in the chemical composition of the two water sources suggests that the Jordan River
  may be the source of the saline ingredients in the Dead Sea or that they share a
  common source of impregnation.
