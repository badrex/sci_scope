revised_title: 'The Action of Light on Selenium: Investigating Electrical Conductivity
  and Sensitivity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical behavior of selenium and its sensitivity
  to light. They discover that selenium's conductivity changes when exposed to light,
  and that different parts of the same piece of selenium can have varying levels of
  sensitivity. They also find that light can generate an electric current in selenium
  and that the direction of the current depends on the illumination of the material.
