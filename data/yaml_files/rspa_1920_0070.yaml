revised_title: The Impact of Asymmetry on Wave-Length Determinations in Spectroscopy
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of asymmetry on the accuracy of wave-length
  measurements in spectroscopy. They propose a method to calculate the displacement
  caused by asymmetry and discuss its implications for spectroscopic measurements
  and the accuracy of micrometer settings.
