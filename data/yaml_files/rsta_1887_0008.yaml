revised_title: 'On the Straining of the Earth''s Crust in Cooling: A Geophysical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author analyzes the effects of the Earth's crust straining and cooling,
  providing a mathematical model to explain the geological effects of these processes.
  The study suggests that the stretching and probable fracture of the strata at some
  depth below the surface can lead to the injection of lower rocks among the upper
  ones, aligning with observed geological phenomena.
