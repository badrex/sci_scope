revised_title: Electro-Magnetic Rotations of Bar-Magnets and Conducting-Wires on their
  Axes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the rotation of bar-magnets and conducting-wires on
  their axes due to electric currents. They demonstrate that the rotation is caused
  by the longitudinal magnetism imparted to the axial wire by the coil-current, and
  that the rotation can occur without the reaction of the moving part of the apparatus
  on any external or fixed body.
