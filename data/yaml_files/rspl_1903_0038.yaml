revised_title: Spectrum of Spontaneous Luminous Radiation of Radium at Ordinary Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Elemental Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spontaneous luminous radiation emitted by radium
  at ordinary temperatures and discover a spectrum consisting of eight bright lines
  and at least eight faint lines. They find that the spectrum is similar to nitrogen's
  spectrum when shifted, suggesting a possible connection between radium and nitrogen.
