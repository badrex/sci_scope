revised_title: Electric Convection and the Distribution of Electric and Magnetic Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The paper investigates the distribution of electric and magnetic forces in electromagnetic
  systems moving through the ether, using Maxwell's theory and vector potential methods.
  The author discusses the motion of point-charges, line-charges, and the mechanical
  forces experienced by moving charges, leading to the concept of the 'Heaviside ellipsoid'
  and the distinction between electric force and mechanical force in these systems.
topics:
- Electric Convection
- Vector Potential
- Electromagnetic Fields
- Maxwell's Equations
- Magnetic Force
