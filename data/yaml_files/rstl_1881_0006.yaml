revised_title: On the Forty-eight Coordinates of a Cubic Curve in Space
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates the forty-eight coordinates of a cubic curve in space,
  establishing a method to reduce the number of independent coordinates to eight.
  The study involves the elimination of variables from two quadric equations representing
  the cubic curve and the transformation of the resulting equations into expressions
  that can be used to determine the coordinates.
