revised_title: Improving Sensitivity in Tangent Galvanometers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Measurement
tldr: The authors develop a new scale for tangent galvanometers, increasing their
  sensitivity and allowing for more precise measurement of smaller currents. This
  innovation is particularly useful in the context of the Post Office's use of sensitive
  and portable instruments for measuring electrical currents in wires, batteries,
  and other apparatus.
