scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, Abraham de la Pryme, describes his observations of a spout, a weather
  phenomenon resembling a tornado, in Yorkshire in 1687. He notes the dry season,
  hot weather, and strong winds, and explains that the spout's motion is due to the
  interaction of contrary winds, leading to condensation and gravitation. The spout
  moves through the area, damaging trees and buildings before eventually dissipating.
