tldr: B. C. Brodie's paper investigates the condition of elements during chemical
  change and proposes that the unique combining properties of elemental particles
  are due to a chemical polarity that occurs during contact between substances. This
  theory is supported by the phenomena of double decomposition and the properties
  of 'nascent' elements, which cannot be inferred from the nature of the element when
  isolated.
