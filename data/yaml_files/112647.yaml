revised_title: A New Method for Calculating the Statical Stability of Ships
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering
tldr: The author presents a new method for calculating the statical stability of ships
  using conic sections and simple equilibrium principles. This method aims to provide
  an easy calculation for determining a ship's stability with minimal extra work compared
  to the traditional sheer-draught calculation.
