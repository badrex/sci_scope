scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering
tldr: The author, W.J. Macquorn Rankine, investigates plane water-lines and their
  properties, proposing a new method for ship design that can create efficient and
  smooth-flowing waterlines. He demonstrates how these water-lines can be used to
  improve ship resistance and performance.
