revised_title: Explaining the Cause of Trade-Winds through Earth's Diurnal Motion
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author proposes that the trade winds are caused by the Earth's diurnal motion
  and the unequal distribution of heat from the sun. The trade winds are a result
  of air being drawn towards the equator from cooler regions, creating a balance between
  east and westward forces.
