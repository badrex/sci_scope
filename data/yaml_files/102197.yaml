  its Axis
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a method for determining the distances of Jupiter's satellites
  from its axis using an instrument and tables of parallaxes and eclipses. The method
  involves measuring parallax intervals, accounting for the duration of eclipses,
  and calculating the intervals of motion to find the distances of the satellites
  from Jupiter's axis.
