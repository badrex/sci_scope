revised_title: Investigating the Electric Property of the Torpedo
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: John Walsh and Sieu Seignette investigate the electric properties of the Torpedo,
  discovering that its effects are similar to those of the Leyden Phial. They find
  that the Torpedo's electricity can be conducted through metals and water, and is
  similar to the electricity in a charged glass. The authors also observe that the
  Torpedo's shocks can be directed by the animal's different states of electricity,
  and that the shocks can be repeated without significant diminution in force.
