tldr: Jacob Perkins investigates the compressibility of water using a piezometer and
  finds that water compresses by about 1% under a pressure of 100 atmospheres. He
  also observes that water can force its way through a corked bottle at great depths,
  and proposes a modified piezometer for more precise future experiments.
