scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Geophysics
tldr: Dr. John Wallis presents a hypothesis about the flux and reflux of the sea,
  considering the common center of gravity of the Earth and Moon. He explores the
  connection between the Moon's motion and the sea's ebbing and flowing, suggesting
  that the Earth's diurnal and annual motion should also be taken into account.
