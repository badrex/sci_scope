revised_title: A Simple Rock Crystal Micrometer for Telescopes
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: G. Dollond presents a new design for a micrometer made of rock crystal, which
  simplifies micrometrical measurements in telescopes. The innovation involves replacing
  the eye-glass with a sphere of rock crystal, eliminating the need for angular cutting.
  This design allows for easier zeroing and taking of intermediate angles, and provides
  a distinct single image when the crystal's axis is parallel to the object glass.
