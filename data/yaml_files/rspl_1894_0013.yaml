scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Internal Medicine
tldr: The author investigates the occurrence of edema in various forms of anaemia
  and concludes that tissue starvation and the presence of products of tissue metabolism
  play significant roles in the development of edema. The author also suggests that
  blood vessels may be involved in the process but their role is considered subordinate
  to the role of the tissues outside the blood vessels.
