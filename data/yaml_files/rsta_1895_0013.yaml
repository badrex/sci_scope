revised_title: On the Velocities of Ions and the Use of Jelly Solutions as a Method
  for Measuring Ion Velocities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the velocities of ions during electrolysis using jelly
  solutions and precipitates as indicators. They determine the velocities of various
  ions, such as barium, calcium, and silver, and compare their findings with previously
  calculated values. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using jelly solutions
  in measuring ion velocities and provides insights into the behavior of ions during
  electrolysis.
