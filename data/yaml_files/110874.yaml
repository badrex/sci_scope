tldr: Sir John Frederick William Herschel observes that a solution of sulphate of
  quinine in tartaric acid, when diluted, exhibits a vivid celestial blue color. This
  color appears to result from the action of the strata the light first penetrates
  upon entering the liquid, and the dispersion of the rays producing the observed
  tint.
