revised_title: 'Inhibition and Relaxation in Antagonistic Muscles: A Study of Reciprocal
  Innervation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuropsychology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the activity of antagonistic
  muscles, specifically the triceps and quadriceps, and demonstrates a phenomenon
  of reciprocal innervation. This occurs when one muscle of an antagonistic pair relaxes
  as its opponent contracts, and can be triggered by various stimuli, such as electrical
  or mechanical excitation.
