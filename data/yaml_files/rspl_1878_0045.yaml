revised_title: Investigating Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids and the Discovery
  of Anomalous Molecular Changes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author develops an improved apparatus to study the thermo-electric properties
  of liquids and discovers several exceptions to the usual effect of acid and alkaline
  liquids. He concludes that electric currents are produced purely by heat and suggests
  the use of this method to detect anomalous molecular alterations in conducting liquids.
topics:
- Thermo-electricity
- Thermo-electric properties
- Molecular structure
- Electric potential
