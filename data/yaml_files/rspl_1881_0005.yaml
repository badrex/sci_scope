revised_title: Investigation of Coefficients of Expansion in Lead Di-Iodide and Lead
  Silver Iodide Alloy
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The authors study the coefficients of expansion in lead di-iodide and an alloy
  of lead iodide and silver iodide, finding that the iodide of lead has three coefficients
  of expansion, while the lead silver iodide alloy exhibits unique contraction and
  expansion behaviors.
