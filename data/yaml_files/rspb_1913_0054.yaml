scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the morphology and distribution of the trypanosome causing
  disease in man in Nyasaland, focusing on the Mzimba strain. They find that the trypanosome
  is identical to the species found in Uganda and is an important disease for domestic
  animals. The primary carrier is G. morsitans, and the reservoir is wild game in
  "fly-country." The authors recommend measures to prevent the spread of the disease
  through infected animals.
