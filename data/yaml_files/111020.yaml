  and Plastron

scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: Professor Owen investigates the development and homologies of the carapace and
  plastron in Chelonian Reptiles. He examines various hypotheses and concludes that
  the carapace and plastron consist of both endoskeletal and dermal bones, with the
  former being haemapophyses or abdominal ribs. The study is supported by observations
  on the development of the skeleton in different Chelonian species and comparisons
  with birds and crocodiles.
