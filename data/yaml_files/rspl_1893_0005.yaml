revised_title: The Bactericidal Action of Light on Bacillus Anthracis and Other Microorganisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The author investigates the bactericidal effects of light on Bacillus anthracis
  and other microorganisms, discovering that the rays of higher refrangibility in
  the blue-violet spectrum are most effective in destroying the life of the spores.
  The study also shows that the inhibitory and deadly effects of direct insolation
  are not limited to Bacillus anthracis, but extend to other bacteria and fungi as
  well.
