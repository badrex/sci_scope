tldr: The author, William Julian Evans, examines the structure and function of the
  spleen in humans and animals. He identifies the spleen as a multilocular reservoir
  with elastic contractility, which serves as a receptacle for blood during temporary
  circulation obstructions. The spleen contains splenic corpuscles and a network of
  lymphatic vessels, contributing to the lymphatic system.
