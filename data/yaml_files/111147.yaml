revised_title: 'Symbolical Physics: Translation of Directed Magnitude and Principles
  of Statics'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author, M. O'Brien, introduces a new approach to symbolical physics by representing
  the translation of a directed magnitude as a product. He applies this concept to
  the principles of statics, the parallelogram of forces, and the effects of forces
  on a rigid body.
topics:
- Symbolical Physics
- Directed Magnitude
- Static Principles
- Parallelogram of Forces
- Rigid Body Mechanics
