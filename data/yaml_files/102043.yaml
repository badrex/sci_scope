scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Pathology
tldr: The author describes a unique polypus found in the heart of a person who died
  from epilepsy. The polypus was firmly rooted in the right ventricle and extended
  into the veins of the arms, legs, and other parts of the body. The author discusses
  the possible causes and nature of these strange concretions and debates the question
  of whether they form suddenly after death or are produced over a longer period of
  time.
