revised_title: Observations on Light Sources and Velocities
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents observations on the relative velocities of various light
  sources, indicating that more refrangible light sources have greater velocities.
  The findings suggest an excess of velocity for blue light over red light, exceeding
  1% of the whole, supporting the view that the velocity of light is related to its
  refrangibility.
