revised_title: On the Osmotic Force and its Relation to Diffusion
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the osmotic force and its relationship
  to diffusion, focusing on the movement of water and salt molecules through porous
  membranes. He concludes that osmotic force is a powerful force capable of supporting
  a column of water, and that liquid diffusion alone cannot fully explain osmotic
  phenomena.
