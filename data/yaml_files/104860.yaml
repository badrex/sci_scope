revised_title: The Rediscovery of Archimedes' Burning Mirrors by Buffon and Nicolini
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The Marquis Nicolini shares Buffon's discovery of a method to recreate Archimedes'
  burning mirrors using 168 small mirrors. They successfully set fire to wooden boards
  at 150 feet distance, and Buffon hopes to increase the distance to 900 feet. The
  device has potential for measuring light intensity and heat of burning bodies, but
  challenges remain in establishing a method for marking degrees and fixing a point
  of comparison.
