  and the Application of Compensating Magnetometer Principle
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the temperature coefficient of a Kew collimator magnet
  and the application of the compensating magnetometer principle. He discusses the
  effects of temperature on the magnet and the potential for a high degree of sensitivity
  in needle galvanometers using this principle.
