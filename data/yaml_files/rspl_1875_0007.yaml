revised_title: The Effect of Oxygenated Blood on the Liver and Glycosuria
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Internal Medicine
tldr: The author investigates the production of glycosuria by causing animals to breathe
  oxygen and perform artificial respiration. The results show that deep and active
  respiration, as well as artificial respiration, can lead to the production of glycosuria,
  suggesting a connection between oxygenated blood and liver function.
