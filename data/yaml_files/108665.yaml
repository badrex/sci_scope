revised_title: Investigating the Conductivity of Metals and Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Material Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors develop a new method to determine the conducting power of metals
  and alloys, allowing them to examine the influence of different metals and their
  proportions on conductivity. They also explore the potential chemical nature of
  alloys and amalgams, aiming to determine if they are simple mixtures or definite
  compounds.
