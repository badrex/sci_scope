revised_title: 'Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations: A Method for Reducing and
  Analyzing Tidal Data'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents a method for analyzing tidal observations using harmonic
  analysis, focusing on the reduction and evaluation of tidal data. The method is
  demonstrated through an example of Bombay's tidal observations, and the author discusses
  the impact of various factors on tidal analysis, such as the moon's position and
  the sun's influence.
