revised_title: 'The Germicidal Action of Ultra-violet Radiation and its Correlation
  with Selective Absorption: Addendum'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the germicidal action of ultra-violet radiation and
  its correlation with selective absorption. They find that the most germicidal region
  of the ultra-violet spectrum of the tungsten arc lies between wave-lengths 2940
  and 2380, and that the extent of bactericidal action depends on the particular organism.
  The correlation between germicidal action and selective absorption of lethal radiations
  by suspensions of bacteria, solutions of protein, etc., has not been experimentally
  tested.
