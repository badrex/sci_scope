revised_title: Influence of Temperature on Harmonium Reeds Pitch
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Music Technology
tldr: The author investigates the impact of temperature on the pitch of harmonium
  reeds and finds that heat flattens and cold sharpens the pitch, with a similar effect
  to tuning forks. The pitch of harmonium reeds is affected by about 1 in 10,000 vibrations
  for each degree Fahrenheit, making it difficult to play harmonium and organ together
  at different temperatures.
