scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Petrology
tldr: The author investigates the differences between Amblygonite and Montebrasite,
  two minerals with similar physical and chemical properties. Through detailed crystallographic
  and optical analysis, the author distinguishes the two minerals as distinct species,
  with Amblygonite being anhydrous and sodiolithic, and Montebrasite being hydrated
  and lithic.
