revised_title: Investigating the Absorption of Radiant Heat by Atmospheric Components
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The authors study the absorption of radiant heat by the atmosphere, focusing
  on the role of water vapor and dry air. They find that the total absorptive power
  of the atmosphere is primarily due to water vapor, while dry air has a negligible
  effect. The authors also discuss the potential variations in the quality of solar
  radiation and the need for further research on this topic.
