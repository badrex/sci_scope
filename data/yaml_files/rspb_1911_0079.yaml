scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathogen Biology
tldr: The author examines the morphology of Trypanosoma gambiense, a species of parasitic
  protozoa, and finds that it is dimorphic and has distinct differences in size and
  shape compared to Trypanosoma brucei. The study provides insights into the structure
  and characteristics of this species, which can aid in understanding its biology
  and potential medical implications.
