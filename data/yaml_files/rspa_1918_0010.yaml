scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author examines the Rankine trochoidal wave, a geometric representation
  of water waves, and explores its properties and applications. The article discusses
  the wave's behavior in various conditions, such as when walls are introduced into
  the water, and how the wave motion can be extended and optimized for different scenarios.
