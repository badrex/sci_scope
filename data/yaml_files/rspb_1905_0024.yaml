revised_title: The Effect of Carbon Dioxide on Geotropic Curvature of Pisum sativum
  Roots
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the impact of varying carbon dioxide concentrations
  on the geotropic curvature of pea (Pisum sativum) roots. The research finds that
  roots exposed to carbon dioxide exhibit a more rapid curvature response compared
  to those in regular air. The optimal partial pressure for this response is determined
  to be around 1-2% carbon dioxide.
