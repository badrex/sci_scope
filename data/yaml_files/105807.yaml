revised_title: Investigating the Lateral Force of Electrical Explosions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, investigates the lateral force produced by electrical
  explosions and discovers that it is not due to the attraction of electric matter.
  Instead, he proposes that the expulsion of air from the place of the explosion causes
  a concussion to nearby objects.
