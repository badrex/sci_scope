revised_title: The Specific Heat of Water and the Mechanical Equivalent of the Calorie
  at Temperatures from 0째C to 80째C
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The authors investigate the specific heat of water and the mechanical equivalent
  of the calorie at temperatures ranging from 0째C to 80째C using an electrical heating
  method. They develop a novel mercury resistance thermometer and discuss the challenges
  and improvements made in their experimental setup. The results contribute to the
  understanding of water's specific heat and the mechanical equivalent of heat.
