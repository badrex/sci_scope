revised_title: The Periodicity of Rainfall and its Relation to Sunspot Activity
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between rainfall patterns and sunspot activity
  using data from the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. The results show a correlation
  between the two, supporting the Meldrum theory, and suggesting that stations with
  large rainfall are suitable for testing the theory.
