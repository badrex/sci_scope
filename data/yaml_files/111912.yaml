scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author, John Allan Broun, investigates the lunar semidiurnal variation of
  atmospheric pressure using two stations, one at Trevandrum and the other on the
  Agustier peak. The study reveals that the oscillation occurring while the moon is
  above the horizon has twice the amount at the lower station compared to the upper
  station, which is difficult to explain by any theory depending solely on the attraction
  of gravitation.
