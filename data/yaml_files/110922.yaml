scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Comparative Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the lumbar spine structure and motion in birds, challenging
  the prevalent opinion that the dorsal and lumbar portions of the spine form a rigid
  structure. Through observations and analysis, the author concludes that some degree
  of lateral flexion actually takes place, and discusses the adaptations that prevent
  pressure on the spinal cord during this motion.
