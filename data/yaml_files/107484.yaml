tldr: Colonel William Lambton measured an arc on the meridian spanning over 9 degrees,
  providing valuable data for understanding the Earth's shape and the compression
  at the poles. The measurements were taken using triangulation techniques and various
  base lines, contributing to the development of geodesy and surveying methods.
