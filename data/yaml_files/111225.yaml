scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author examines the anatomy of antennae in a small crustacean species, focusing
  on the unique structure of the male's right antenna. The study reveals sexual dimorphism
  in the antennae, with the male's right antenna having a hypertrophied condition
  and a prehensile organ composed of 25 segments. The paper also discusses the crustacean's
  locomotion and the muscles that move the complex antenna apparatus.
