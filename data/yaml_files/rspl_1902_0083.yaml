revised_title: The Electrical Criterion for Diagnosing the Living State in Hen's Eggs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the use of an electrical criterion, or 'blaze reaction,'
  to distinguish between living and non-living hen's eggs. The study finds that the
  presence of a living embryo can be diagnosed by observing the presence or absence
  of blaze-currents, providing valuable information for understanding embryonic development.
