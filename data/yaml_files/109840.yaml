tldr: John Pond, the Astronomer Royal, presents a catalogue of the North Polar Distances
  and proper motion of thirty fixed stars. The catalogue is an improvement over his
  previous work, with the estimated error not exceeding one-fourth of a second. A
  comparative catalogue of the same stars' positions in 1756, as deduced from Dr.
  Bradley's observations, is also provided, along with a column of annual proper motions
  for each star.
