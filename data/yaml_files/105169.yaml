revised_title: Observations of Mercury's Transit and the Effects of Atmospheric Conditions
  on Telescope Images
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Instrumentation
tldr: The author describes the observations of the transit of Mercury and discusses
  the effects of atmospheric conditions on the images produced by reflecting telescopes.
  He concludes that atmospheric agitation can cause indistinctness in telescope images,
  and that the use of a well-made reflecting telescope can minimize this issue.
