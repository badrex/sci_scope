tldr: The authors investigate the sexuality and development of the ascocarp in Humaria
  granulata, a common fungus found on animal dung. They observe that the ascocarp
  develops without fertilization by an antheridium and find that the ascogonium undergoes
  a process of parthenogenesis, with female nuclei fusing in pairs to form ascogenous
  hyphae. This research contributes to the understanding of sexual reproduction in
  fungi and the development of the ascocarp in Ascomycetes.
