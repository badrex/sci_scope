revised_title: Restoration of Co-ordinated Movements and Interchange of Cerebral Cortical
  Centres after Nerve Crossing
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author investigates the restoration of co-ordinated movements and the interchange
  of function of cerebral cortical centres after nerve crossing in dogs. The experiments
  show that animals can regain the power of performing voluntary co-ordinated movements
  with the affected muscles and reveal changes in the cerebral cortical centres affected
  by the crossing.
