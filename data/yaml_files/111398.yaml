scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Alkaloids
tldr: The author investigates the properties and reactions of thialdine, a prototype
  of an important class of alkaloids containing sulfur. Through a series of experiments,
  Hofmann establishes that thialdine is a tertiary base and a nitrile-base, and provides
  evidence that it does not transform into leucine as previously claimed.
