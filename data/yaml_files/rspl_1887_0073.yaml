revised_title: Investigation of Mucilage Secretion in Blechnum Occidentale and Osmunda
  Regalis Ferns
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors study the structure and function of mucilage cells in Blechnum occidentale
  and Osmunda regalis ferns, discovering that mucilage secretion occurs intraprotoplasmically
  and that the mature cells are full of the secretion, which takes up water and becomes
  very bulky.
