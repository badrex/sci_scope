scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neuropsychology
tldr: The author investigates the sensory nerves of eye muscles and finds that the
  ophthalmic division of the trigeminus nerve does not innervate the sensorial musculo-tendinous
  organs of the eye muscles. The study also confirms the importance of peripheral
  apparatus of muscular sense in coordinating eye movements.
