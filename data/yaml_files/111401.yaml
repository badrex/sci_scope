revised_title: 'Density of Ozone: Experimental Determination and Allotropic Relation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: Thomas Andrews and P. G. Tait experimentally determine the density of ozone
  and find that it is nearly four times less dense than oxygen, assuming ozone is
  an allotropic form of oxygen.
topics:
- Ozone
- Allotropy
- Gas Density
- Experimental Chemistry
- Atmospheric Pressure
