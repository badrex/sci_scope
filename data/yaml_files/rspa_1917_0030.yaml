revised_title: Magnetic Inertia and Its Applications
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the concept of magnetic inertia, proposing that a magnetized
  body possesses magnetic inertia similar to how an electrified body has electric
  inertia. The author calculates the magnetic inertia of a sphere and discusses its
  implications for the Earth, the Sun, and the theory of electrons and magnetons.
