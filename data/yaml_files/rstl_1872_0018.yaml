revised_title: Experiments on the Directive Power of Large Steel Magnets and Galvanic
  Coils
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the directive power of large steel
  magnets, magnetized soft iron bars, and galvanic coils on external small magnets.
  They investigated the magnetic force exerted by these objects and the effect of
  galvanic currents on the magnetic power. The study provides insights into the distribution
  of magnetic power in steel magnets and the influence of galvanic currents on soft
  iron.
