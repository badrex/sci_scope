revised_title: Effects of Pressure on Polarization and Crystallization in Jellies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: David Brewster investigates the effects of pressure on the polarization and
  crystallization of substances like animal jellies and isinglass jelly. He discovers
  that pressure can cause depolarization and the formation of complementary colors
  in these materials, which revert to their original state when the pressure is removed.
