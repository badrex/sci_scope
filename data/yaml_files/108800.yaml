tldr: The authors analyze the chemical composition of narcotine and its decomposition
  products, opianic acid and cotarnine. They determine that narcotine has a formula
  of C22 H23 NO7 and that cotarnine has a formula of C12 H13 N3. The study provides
  a better understanding of the chemical nature of these substances and their transformations.
