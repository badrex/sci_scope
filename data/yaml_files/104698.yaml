tldr: The author, William Arderon, documents the excessive heat in Norwich during
  July 1749, providing daily thermometer readings and describing the effects of the
  heat on people and objects. He compares the heat to previous years and concludes
  that the heat wave was more gradual in onset compared to 1748, which may have contributed
  to its perceived intensity.
