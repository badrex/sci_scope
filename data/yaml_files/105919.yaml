revised_title: The Effect of Aberration of Light on the Time of a Transit of Venus
  Over the Sun
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: Richard Price discusses the effect of the aberration of light on the time of
  a transit of Venus over the Sun. He explains that the aberration of both Venus and
  the Sun affects the phases of a transit, causing a retardation in the observed time.
  Price also corrects a previous mistake in his calculations and provides a more accurate
  estimation of the error caused by aberration.
