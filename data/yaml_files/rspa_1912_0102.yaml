revised_title: The Absorption of Beta-Rays and the Exponential Law
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiation Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the absorption of beta-rays using radium E and finds
  that the exponential law of absorption is only approximate, as beta-rays become
  more absorbable after passing through a certain thickness of matter.

- Beta-Rays Absorption
- Exponential Law
- Radiation Physics
- Radium E
