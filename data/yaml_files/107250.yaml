revised_title: Experiments on the Voltaic Apparatus and Its Effect on Conductors
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author investigates the most advantageous method of constructing a Voltaic
  apparatus for chemical research and compares its effects on various conductors.
  The study confirms Mr. Davy's theory of the mode of action of the Voltaic battery,
  showing that the intensity increases with the number of plates and the quantity
  with the extent of the series.
