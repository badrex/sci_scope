revised_title: Synthesis and Analysis of Lactic Acid Derivatives
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the synthesis of new lactic acid derivatives by replacing
  one atom of dyad oxygen in oxalic acid with two atoms of monad alcohol radicals.
  They successfully produce a new member of the lactic series, ethylic diethoxalate,
  and provide a detailed analysis of its composition and formation.
