revised_title: The Continuity of Effect of Light and Electric Radiation on Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the effects of light and electric radiation on matter,
  proposing that the observed effects are due to molecular strain. The study employs
  methods that measure conductivity variation and the similarities between mechanical
  and radiation strains, providing evidence for the fundamental unity of effects caused
  by visible and invisible radiation.
topics:
- Molecular Strain
- Electric Radiation
- Conductivity Variation
- Photographic Action
- Molecular Mobility
