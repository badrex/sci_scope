revised_title: Temperature and the Rate of Action of Drugs on Muscle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the rate of action of various
  drugs, including alcohol, chloroform, quinine, and aconitine, on muscle. They find
  that the rate of action increases with temperature and that the temperature coefficient
  of increase ranges from 2.0 to 2.52 per 10°C. The study provides insights into the
  relationship between temperature and drug action, with implications for drug dosing
  and treatment.
