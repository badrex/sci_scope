revised_title: Observations of Nebulous Stars and Their Potential Nature
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Object Observation & Analysis
tldr: The author, W. Derham, observes nebulous stars through an eight-foot reflecting
  telescope and concludes that they are not clusters of stars or emitting bodies like
  the Sun and Moon. He suggests that they could be vast regions of light or possibly
  chasms leading to an immense area beyond the fixed stars.
