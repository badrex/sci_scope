scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: This paper by David Ferrier and Gerald F. Yeo details the effects of localized
  brain lesions in various regions of the cerebral hemispheres on vision, hearing,
  motor function, and sensory processing in monkeys. The study uses anatomical descriptions
  and illustrations to classify the lesions and their resulting effects, providing
  insights into the functions of different brain regions.
