scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of active protozoa in soil and their potential
  role in soil health. They develop a method to extract and culture protozoa from
  soil samples, finding various species in active states in cucumber beds and seedling
  beds. This research sheds light on the importance of protozoa in soil ecosystems
  and their potential impact on soil sickness.
