  of Bodies in Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Mechanics

  the force of bodies in motion. He argues that the experiment does not support Leibniz's
  notion and demonstrates that the resistance theory aligns with the common understanding
  of motion.
