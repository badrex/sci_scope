revised_title: Investigating Electricity in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts experiments in a vacuum to study the behavior of electricity
  and its effects on non-electric substances. The results demonstrate that the atmosphere,
  when dry, is the agent responsible for accumulating electricity on non-electrics,
  and reveal insights into the nature of electrical repulsion and the role of air
  in electrical phenomena.
