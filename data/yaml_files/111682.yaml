tldr: Joule and Thomson conducted experiments to determine the thermal effects of
  various elastic fluids, such as air, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid,
  in motion. They found that the thermal effect varies depending on the type of gas
  and its pressure, with mixtures of gases generally showing a smaller cooling effect
  than pure gases.
