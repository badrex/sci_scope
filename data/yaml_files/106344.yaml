revised_title: Calculations and Measurements of the Base at Schehallien to Determine
  Earth's Mean Density
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Surveying
tldr: Charles Hutton describes the calculations and measurements taken at Schehallien
  to determine the mean density of the Earth. He outlines the methods used, including
  the use of theodolites and measuring rods, and provides detailed tables of measurements
  and calculations. The results contribute to a better understanding of the Earth's
  density and the techniques used in geodesy and surveying.
