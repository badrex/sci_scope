revised_title: Investigating the Influence of the Condenser on Ruhmkorff Coil Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The author investigates the impact of a condenser on the efficiency of a Ruhmkorff
  coil, finding that the energy stored in the magnetic field and the energy lost in
  the spark at the interrupter significantly affect the coil's performance. The study
  also reveals that the efficiency of the coil is lower than 45% under the tested
  conditions.
