scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: Sir G. B. Airy investigates the tides at Malta using a tide-gauge and records
  the data from 1871 to 1877. He discovers that the non-tidal undulations, or Seiches,
  at Malta are formed by waves reflected from opposite shores, creating stationary
  waves between them. Airy also examines the effects of the moon's declination on
  the mean height of tides and the influence of Seiches on tidal measurements.
