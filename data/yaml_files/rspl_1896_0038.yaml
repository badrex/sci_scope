  in the Cerebellum

tldr: This study investigates the effects of interrupting afferent and efferent tracts
  of the cerebellum on motor control, sensory processing, and ocular displacements.
  The results suggest that the cerebellum may play a role in sensory processes, and
  that some motor defects following cerebellar lesions may be due to the interruption
  of afferent impulses rather than the loss of efferent impulses to spinal centers.
