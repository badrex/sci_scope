revised_title: Faraday's Experiments on Regelation and Ice Adhesion
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cryology & Glaciology
tldr: James Thomson analyzes Faraday's experiments on ice adhesion and regelation,
  discussing the role of capillary action and the flexibility of ice under tension.
  He argues that his own theory of ice plasticity aligns with the experimental results,
  contrary to Faraday's interpretation.
