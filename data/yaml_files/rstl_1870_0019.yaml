revised_title: On the Chemical Action of High Refrangibility Rays on Gaseous Matter
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the chemical effects of high refrangibility rays on
  gaseous matter, specifically the decomposition of nitrite vapour. He discovers that
  the shorter, more powerful ether waves can cause chemical reactions by accumulating
  infinitesimal impulses at the proper intervals, leading to the breaking of molecular
  bonds.
