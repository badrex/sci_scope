revised_title: Properties of Matter in Gaseous and Liquid States under Varying Temperature
  and Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the properties of gaseous and liquid mixtures, particularly
  nitrogen and carbonic acid, under varying temperature and pressure conditions. The
  study reveals deviations from Dalton's law of gaseous mixtures, a lowered critical
  point of temperature with admixture, and an increase in the volume of mixtures under
  high pressure.
topics:
- Gas Mixtures
- Critical Point of Temperature
- Diffusion
