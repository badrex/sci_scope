revised_title: On Reversed Photographs of the Solar Spectrum Beyond the Red
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Captain J. Waterhouse investigates the reversed photographs of the solar spectrum
  beyond the red using a collodion plate and discovers that the extreme red rays have
  the ability to neutralize the action of white light on sensitive plates. This finding
  could have practical applications in spectroscopic photography, particularly for
  mapping difficult-to-observe parts of the spectrum.
