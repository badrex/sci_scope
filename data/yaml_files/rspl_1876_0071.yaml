revised_title: Investigating the Changes of Fixed Corpuscles in Corneal Inflammation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the changes of fixed corpuscles in corneal inflammation
  and concludes that the process primarily consists of the penetration of colorless
  corpuscles (migratory cells) into the cornea's cell spaces, undergoing cell division.
  The fixed corpuscles remain unaltered, refuting the claim of their proliferation
  during inflammation.
