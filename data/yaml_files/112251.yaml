revised_title: On the Exact Form and Motion of Waves in Deep Water
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the exact form and motion of waves in deep water, proving
  that the trochoidal form fulfills the mathematical and dynamic conditions of wave
  motion, regardless of the size of the wave's displacement. This study also explores
  the relationship between wave profiles, pressure surfaces, and particle orbits,
  as well as the impact of friction between a wave and a wave-shaped solid.
