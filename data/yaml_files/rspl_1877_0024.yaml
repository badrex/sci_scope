revised_title: The Cause of Bright Lines in the Spectra of Irresolvable Star Clusters
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Evolution
tldr: The author proposes a theory that the appearance of bright lines in the spectra
  of irresolvable star clusters is due to the light from the gaseous envelopes surrounding
  the stars. As the distance from the observer increases, the light from the gaseous
  envelopes becomes more dominant, resulting in a linear spectrum similar to that
  of our sun's gaseous surroundings.
