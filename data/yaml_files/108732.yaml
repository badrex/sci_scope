revised_title: On the Effect of Compass Needle Length and Arrangement on Deviations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of compass needle length and arrangement
  on deviations in iron ships. They discover that the length of the compass needle
  and its position relative to nearby iron can introduce errors in deviation correction,
  which can impact the accuracy of navigation.
