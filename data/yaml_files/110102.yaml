revised_title: Investigating Annual Variations in Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: J. Pond examines the annual variations of 23 principal fixed stars using observations
  from Dr. Brinkley and the Astronomer Royal. The results show mixed southern and
  northern deviations, with some stars indicating greater deviations than previously
  thought. Pond acknowledges the difficulty in determining such small quantities through
  astronomical observations and hopes for a resolution in the near future.
