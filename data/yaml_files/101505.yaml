revised_title: 'A New Frigorifick Experiment: Producing Cold Without Snow, Ice, Hail,
  Wind, or Niter'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author describes a new experiment that produces a considerable degree of
  cold without the use of snow, ice, hail, wind, or niter. The experiment involves
  mixing sal armoniack with water and demonstrates the production of cold through
  a chemical reaction. The duration and intensity of the cold can be adjusted by varying
  the mixture's ingredients and method of application.
