revised_title: Improving the Accuracy of Freezing Point Determination
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors present a new method for accurately determining the freezing point
  of liquids using a thermostat and cooler system. The method allows for consistent
  results and is applicable to all types of thermometers. The authors also describe
  a platinum thermometer and bridge capable of indicating a change of 0.0001Â°, providing
  a more accurate control of the freezing process.
