scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolites
tldr: The author describes a process to isolate a crystalline fatty acid from human
  urine and discusses its properties. The fatty acid is found to be white, crystalline,
  and has a melting point of 54Â°C. It is insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol

  acid.
