revised_title: The Emission of Electricity from Various Substances at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the emission of electricity from various substances
  at high temperatures, such as alkaline earths, metals, and oxides, using a carbon
  resistance-furnace. They found that all tested substances emitted copious streams
  of negative electricity at high temperatures, with some materials increasing the
  ionization current more than others.

- High-temperature physics
- Ionization currents
