  and Vaso-Motory Symptoms

scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of refrigeration on the ulnar nerve and
  its sensory, motory, and vaso-motory symptoms. The study reveals that cold application
  to the nerve causes hyperesthesia, followed by anesthesia, increased excitability,
  and eventually paralysis. Temperature changes are also observed, with the inner
  fingers experiencing a rise in temperature as the nerve becomes paralyzed.
