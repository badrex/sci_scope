tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of monacid polyamines,
  specifically cyantriethyl-diamine and carbotriethyltriamine, through reactions involving
  cyanate of ethyl and ethylate of sodium. The transformation of cyanuric ether into
  ethylamine is also explored, revealing the role of water molecules in these reactions.
