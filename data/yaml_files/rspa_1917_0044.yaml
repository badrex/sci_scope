revised_title: Tidal Influence on Oceanic Level Disturbances and Geodynamical Discrepancy
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of oceanic tides on the Earth's surface and
  its potential influence on the lunar attraction discrepancy. They calculate the
  effects of tidal forces on the surface level and vertical deflection, concluding
  that the tilting effect of the tide is more significant than the attraction effect.
