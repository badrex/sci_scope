revised_title: Clairaut's Theorem and Applications in Astronomy and Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates Clairaut's Theorem and its applications in astronomy
  and mechanics. He proves the existence of principal axes for any point of a body
  and demonstrates how the theorem can be applied to the case of the Earth, considering
  the attraction of a spheroid on a point on its surface.
