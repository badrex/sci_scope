  Study'

tldr: A body discovered in a vault in Staverton church, England, was found to be remarkably
  well-preserved, with skin, hair, and limbs still in good condition after over 80
  years. The preservation is attributed to a combination of factors, including the
  use of pitch-cloths and water, which protected the body from external elements and
  maintained its integrity. Various theories, including supernatural causes, have
  been proposed to explain the phenomenon, but the authors argue that natural agents
  are responsible for the preservation.
