scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Instrumentation
tldr: The authors describe the development and theory of the katharometer, an instrument
  capable of detecting the presence of hydrogen in air. The katharometer works by
  measuring the change in thermal conductivity of a gas due to the admixture of hydrogen.
  The authors also discuss the heat losses and end corrections in the katharometer,
  which are essential for accurate readings.
