revised_title: The Impact of Dissolved Substances on Yeast Autofermentation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the effect of dissolved substances, particularly salts,
  on the autofermentation of yeast. It finds that molar sodium chloride significantly
  increases the rate of autofermentation, while other salts also show similar effects.
  The research concludes that this acceleration is not due to a direct action of the
  salt on the enzymes but may be related to plasmolysis or the removal of inhibitory
  substances within the cell.
