revised_title: On the Proportions of Acid and Base in Binacid Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the proportions of acid and base in binacid salts, specifically
  super-oxalates and sub-carbonates, and discovers a consistent pattern of simple
  multiples in their composition. This observation supports Dalton's theory of chemical
  combination and suggests that a geometrical understanding of atomic arrangement
  may be necessary for a more complete explanation of chemical reactions.
