revised_title: Densities of Solid Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Hydrogen at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Cryogenics
tldr: This article presents experiments on the solid densities of oxygen, nitrogen,
  and hydrogen at low temperatures. The author measures the volumes of gases condensed
  into a cooled space and calculates the densities of the condensed gases. The results
  provide insights into the physical constants and properties of these elements at
  low temperatures.
