revised_title: Investigating the Properties of Light and its Flexion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the properties of light, focusing on flexion
  and the formation of fringes. They discover that the flexion of light is in proportion
  to the breadth of the colored fringes formed and that these fringes are real images
  of the light source. The author also observes that the fringes' breadths and positions
  vary depending on the color of light.
