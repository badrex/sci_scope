revised_title: Experimental Researches on Electric Conduction and Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry
tldr: Faraday's research explores the conduction and decomposition of electricity
  in various substances. He discovers that some substances, when solid, do not conduct
  electricity from a voltaic battery, but when liquefied, they become conductors and
  are decomposed. The study also reveals that fluidity is not essential for decomposition
  and that no distinction can be made between the conducting powers of elementary
  and compound substances.
