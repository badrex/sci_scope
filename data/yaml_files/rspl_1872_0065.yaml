revised_title: 'On the Heating of a Disk by Rapid Rotation in Vacuo: Further Experiments
  and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: 'The authors conduct experiments to investigate the heating effect of a rotating
  disk in a vacuum. They find that the heating effect is independent of the density
  and chemical composition of the residual air and gas surrounding the disk. The results
  suggest that there may be two effects contributing to the overall heating: a gas
  effect and a residual effect.'
