revised_title: The Nature and Mechanism of Muscular Motion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: The author discusses the nature of muscular motion, distinguishing it as an
  original rather than communicated motion. He also refutes the idea that nerves play
  a role in muscle contractions, providing evidence that stimuli can act on distant
  muscles without the involvement of nerves.
