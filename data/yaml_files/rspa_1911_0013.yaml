revised_title: Improved Method for Measuring Absolute Expansion of Mercury
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors improve upon Regnault's method for measuring the absolute expansion
  of mercury, using a more accurate apparatus and techniques. They find that the mean
  coefficient of expansion is consistent with previous findings, and their results
  are used to refine the boiling point of sulfur on the constant pressure air thermometer
  scale.
