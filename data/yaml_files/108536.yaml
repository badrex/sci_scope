revised_title: On the Electro-Chemical Polarity of Gases and Their Effects on Electrodes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the electro-chemical polarity of gases and their effects
  on electrodes. They discover that gases do not conduct electricity in a similar
  manner to metals or electrolytes and that the polarization of dielectrics can be
  chemical in nature. The author also observes a new mode of transmission of electricity
  that is intermediate between the voltaic arc and the Franklinic discharge.
