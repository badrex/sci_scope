revised_title: The Vertical Temperature Distribution in the Atmosphere over England
  and its Relation to Local and General Circulation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author analyzes temperature data from 200 free balloon ascents over England
  to understand the vertical temperature distribution in the atmosphere. The study
  reveals that temperature is largely dependent on barometric height, with a noticeable
  annual temperature variation. The findings contribute to the understanding of local
  and general atmospheric circulation patterns.
