scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on the brains of monkeys, focusing
  on the effects of ablation and destruction of localized brain regions. The results
  indicate that the frontal lobes play a significant role in controlling movement,
  sensation, and behavior, while other regions remain less understood in terms of
  their functions.
