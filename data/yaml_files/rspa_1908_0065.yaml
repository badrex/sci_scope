revised_title: A New Method for Counting Alpha Particles from Radioactive Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear Physics & Radioactivity
tldr: Rutherford and Geiger develop a method to count alpha particles from radioactive
  substances by using gas ionization and a Dolezalek electrometer. The method involves
  magnifying the electrical effect of a single alpha particle by producing fresh ions
  through collisions in a low-pressure gas exposed to an electric field.
