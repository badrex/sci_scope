revised_title: 'The Formation of Ripplemarks: A Study of Wave and Current Interactions'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geomorphology
tldr: The author investigates the formation of ripplemarks, concluding that they are
  primarily formed by the alternate action of waves rather than tidal currents or
  sea beaches. The study examines wave and current interactions on the bottom of Torbay
  and the English Channel, providing evidence that supports this conclusion.
