scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the development of semilunar valves in the chick heart,
  providing insights into the division of the truncus arteriosus and the formation
  of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The study contributes to understanding congenital
  malformations of the heart and sheds light on the development of semilunar valves
  in humans and mammals.
