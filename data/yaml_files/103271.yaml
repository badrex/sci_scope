revised_title: An Experiment on Sound Propagation in a Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducts an experiment to investigate sound propagation in a vacuum.
  He encloses a bell in a receiver and exhausts the air between the receivers. When
  the bell is struck, the sound is still vigorous, indicating that sound can propagate
  through a vacuum.
