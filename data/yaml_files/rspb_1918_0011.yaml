revised_title: The Galvanometric Investigation of Emotive Physiological Changes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Psychology
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between emotional states and electrical
  responses in the body using a galvanometer. The author finds that strong emotional
  stimuli, such as loud sounds, painful thoughts, and disagreeable smells, can cause
  noticeable changes in electrical conductivity, suggesting a connection between emotions
  and physiological responses.
