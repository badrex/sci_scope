scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author examines the influence of the moon on magnetic declination at Toronto,
  St. Helena, and Hobarton, analyzing hourly observations of the declination over
  several years. The study reveals a systematic variation in the magnetic direction
  depending on the moon's hour-angle, suggesting a magnetic influence of the moon
  on Earth's surface.
