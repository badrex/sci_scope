revised_title: On the Consequences of Ohm's Law and the Electromotive Force in Voltaic
  Circuits
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: John Frederic Daniell discusses the consequences of Ohm's law and the electromotive
  force in voltaic circuits. He applies this theory to verify previous conclusions
  and suggests additional experiments to clarify ambiguities. Daniell also provides
  practical remarks on various voltaic battery arrangements and explains the principles
  behind his own cylindrical battery design.
