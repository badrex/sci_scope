tldr: The authors, Ezerel Tonge and Francis Willoughby, conduct experiments and observations
  on the motion of sap in trees, focusing on the effects of weather, temperature,
  and season on sap flow. They discuss various factors that may influence sap movement
  and explore the potential implications for tree growth, fruitfulness, and climate.
