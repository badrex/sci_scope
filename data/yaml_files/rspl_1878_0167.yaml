revised_title: Investigating Molecular Changes in Electrically Conducting Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author explores the relationship between molecular structure and the production
  of electric currents in conducting liquids. They discover that irregular molecular
  changes can affect the direction and amount of electric currents, suggesting new
  methods for detecting anomalous molecular alterations and physical and chemical
  changes in electrically conducting liquids.
