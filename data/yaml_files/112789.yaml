revised_title: On the Values of Integrals and their Application to the Theory of Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates integrals related to Laplace's coefficients and their
  application in the theory of radiation. They provide a solution for a uniform conducting
  sphere exposed to heat from a radiant point and generalize the solution for a sphere
  exposed to any kind of radiation from a distance. The study reveals that the effect
  of odd-order harmonic terms in radiation is nil, with the exception of the first-order
  term.
