revised_title: Physiological Classification of Protozoa and Their Evolutionary Relationships
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Protozoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines the physiological classification of protozoa and their evolutionary
  relationships, discussing their habits of life, modes of nutrition, and potential
  origins. The study suggests that certain protozoa may have evolved from other types,
  such as the cestoid worms possibly derived from the Gregarinida, and provides insights
  into the possible relationships between different groups of protozoa.
