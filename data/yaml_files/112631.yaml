scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The author isolates oxalurate of ammonia from human urine and investigates its
  properties, finding that it decomposes into oxalic acid and urea. The presence of
  this compound may explain the formation of oxalate of lime in urine over time.
