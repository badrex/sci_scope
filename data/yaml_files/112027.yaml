scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates Newton's rule for discovering imaginary roots in algebraic
  equations and provides a rigorous demonstration for equations up to the 5th degree.
  The study also introduces the concept of conjugate equations and their significance
  in understanding the behavior of imaginary roots.
topics:
- Algebraic Equations
- Imaginary Roots
- Mathematical Analysis
- Newton's Rule
- Conjugate Equations
