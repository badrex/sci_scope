revised_title: The Tubercular Swellings on the Roots of Leguminosae and the Role of
  Parasitic Fungi
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author, H. Marshall Ward, discovers that the tubercular swellings on the
  roots of Leguminosae plants are caused by a parasitic fungus. He successfully infects
  healthy roots, identifies the infecting agent, and observes its growth inside the
  tubercles. The fungus's role in inducing root hypertrophy and its potential impact
  on agriculture is discussed.
