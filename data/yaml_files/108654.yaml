scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the partitions of an r-pyramid, focusing on the first
  class of r-gonous x-edra, and provides a method for determining the number of different
  r-gonous (r+K+1)-acral (r+k+1)-edra that can be made by partitioning the base and
  vertex of the r-pyramid.
