revised_title: On the Polarisation of Light by Reflexion from Transparent Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the laws that regulate the polarization
  of light by reflection from transparent bodies. He discovers a simple law stating
  that the index of refraction is the tangent of the angle of polarization. This research
  helps to establish a scientific foundation for understanding the behavior of polarized
  light and its applications.
