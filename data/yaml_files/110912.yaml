tldr: C. Handfield Jones investigates the liver's secretory apparatus and function,
  confirming Mr. Bowman's view that there are no real tubercular ducts in the lobules.
  He describes the process of secretion starting in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding
  the central axis of the lobule, and how the fluid is further elaborated and transmitted
  to the surrounding ducts.
