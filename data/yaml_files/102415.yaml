revised_title: Experiments on Concave Specula and Parabolic Figures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: In this letter, Stephen Gray describes his experiments on creating concave specula
  nearly of a parabolic figure. He explains how a linen cloth, when suspended, forms
  a regular concave surface suspected to be parabolical. Gray also discusses the potential
  for creating mutable specula with adjustable focal lengths for various purposes.
