revised_title: 'Measurements of the Absolute Indices of Refraction in Strained Glass:
  A New Method and Results'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the absolute indices of refraction
  in strained glass and apply it to two types of glass, borosilicate and Uviol. They
  calculate stress-optical coefficients for various spectrum lines and discuss the
  implications of their findings.
topics:
- Stres
- Glass Refraction
- Borosilicate Glass
- Uviol Glass
- Optical Properties of Materials
