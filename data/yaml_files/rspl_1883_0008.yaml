revised_title: A New Method for Determining the Atomic Weight of Manganese
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the atomic weight of manganese using silver permanganate
  and various reducing agents. They find that the use of silver permanganate provides
  a stable and accurate method for determining the atomic weight of manganese, with
  results that are less affected by secondary causes of variation.
