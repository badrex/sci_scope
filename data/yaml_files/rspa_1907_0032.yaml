scientific_subdiscipline: Chemistry of Materials & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: Morris W. Travers investigates the absorption of water by cotton and wool, finding
  that the curves do not exhibit a tendency to bend to the right, unlike the results
  of Professor Trouton's experiments. Travers suggests that absorption of vapors by
  amorphous substances involves the formation of solid solutions.
