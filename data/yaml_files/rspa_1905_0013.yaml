revised_title: An Investigation of Atmospheric Conductivity and Electric Charge Dissipation
  During Nor'westers
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the rate of dissipation of electric charges in the open
  air during nor'westers, a type of weather phenomenon known for their dry and hot
  winds. The study reveals that the conductivity of the air for both positive and
  negative electricity is irregular, with distinct double maxima and minima values.
  The author also finds that nor'westers have a negative potential relative to the
  earth, contrary to the usual condition.
