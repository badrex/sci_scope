  Machine
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the determination of cup anemometer constants using
  a whirling machine and proposes a method to improve the accuracy of the measurements
  by comparing two similar anemometers and accounting for friction. The method involves
  recording and measuring brake friction during observations to account for variations
  in wind and other factors.
