revised_title: On the Density of the Earth and the Irregularities of its Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the density of the Earth and the irregularities of its
  surface, focusing on the effects of compression and elasticity. The study concludes
  that the general law of compression can explain the greater density of the Earth's
  internal parts, and that the resistance of solids to compression is not significantly
  affected by lateral expansion.
