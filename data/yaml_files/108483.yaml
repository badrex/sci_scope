revised_title: On the Transpiration of Gases and the Properties of Capillary Tubes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the transpiration of various gases through capillary
  tubes and discovers that the transpiration velocity of gases is influenced by factors
  such as resistance, tube length, and gas properties. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of gases and the importance of capillary tubes in understanding
  gas dynamics.
