scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Development
tldr: The author discusses the role of the placenta and chorion in animal reproduction,
  particularly in preventing confusion when different species interbreed. He also
  explains that the period of utero-gestation depends on the structure of the placenta
  or chorion, and that hybrid offspring are born at the end of the longest utero-gestation
  period of the involved species. Lastly, the author proposes a new classification
  of animals based on placenta structure.
