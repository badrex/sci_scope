tldr: Captain H. G. Lyons and Professor RÃ¼cker conducted magnetic observations in
  Egypt from 1893 to 1901, using a Declinatorium and Kew Magnetometer. They recorded
  declination, dip, and horizontal force at various locations, including Cairo, the
  Lybian Desert, and the Nile Valley. The study aimed to understand the magnetic field
  variations and the impact of geological features on the observations.
