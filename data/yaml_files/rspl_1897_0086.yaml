revised_title: Investigation of the Electromotive Force of Clark Standard Cells and
  Their Temperature Coefficients
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the electromotive force and temperature coefficients
  of various forms of the Clark standard cell, aiming to improve their accuracy and
  reliability for use in electrical measurements. They develop a simple modification
  to the Board of Trade form of the cell and create hermetically sealed cells with
  improved durability. The study also examines the effects of solution strength on
  the cell's electromotive force.
