revised_title: Experimental Proof of Blood-Platelets' Cellular Nature through Vacuolation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author demonstrates the cellular nature of blood-platelets through the process
  of vacuolation. By observing the effects of morphine on blood cells, the author
  concludes that blood-platelets are cells and not fragments of other cells, supporting
  the theory that they are derived from a common source.
