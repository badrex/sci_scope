revised_title: Investigation of Astronomical Aberration of Light through Refracting
  Medium
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author presents the collected results of observations on y Draconis made
  with the water-telescope in 1871 and 1872. The uniformity of results proves the
  correctness of the coefficient of aberration used in the Nautical Almanac. The author
  plans to reverify the scale of the micrometer and dismount the instrument for further
  study.
