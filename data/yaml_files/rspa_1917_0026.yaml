revised_title: On Residual Magnetism and Magnetic Shielding Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the residual magnetism in relation to magnetic shielding
  efficiency and find that a complete demagnetization of a mass of iron requires the
  absence of external magnetic fields, such as the Earth's field. They also develop
  a method to measure very small values of magnetic induction accurately and demonstrate
  the importance of surrounding the shield with a current to neutralize external fields
  during the demagnetization process.
