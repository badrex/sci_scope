revised_title: A New Quartz Thread Gravity Balance for Measuring Gravitational Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics and Instrumentation
tldr: The authors develop a new quartz thread gravity balance to measure gravitational
  force, overcoming the limitations of previous methods. They successfully test the
  balance in various locations, achieving high accuracy and sensitivity in measuring
  small variations in gravitational force.
