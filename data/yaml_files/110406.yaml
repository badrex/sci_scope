revised_title: The Connection between Refracted and Diffracted Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Paul Cooper, explores the connection between refracted and diffracted
  light, demonstrating that white refracted light is formed by the superposition of
  fringes of colors or uniformly refracted rays that compensate each other. He also
  shows that diffracted white light is formed by the superposition of fringes that
  are not uniformly refracted but still maintain mutual compensation.
