revised_title: Repetition and Analysis of Arago's Experiments on Magnetism in Rotating
  Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Babbage and Herschel recount their replication of Arago's experiments on magnetism
  in various substances during rotation. They found that substances like copper, zinc,
  and silver exhibited magnetism when rotated with a powerful horse-shoe magnet. The
  authors also investigated the effect of solution of continuity on metals and the
  law of diminution of the magnetic force by increase of distance.
