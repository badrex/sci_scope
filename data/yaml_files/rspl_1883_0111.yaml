scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: Edward Schunck investigates the separation and properties of chlorophyll components
  using carbon disulfide and acid decomposition. He finds that chlorophyll is not
  a glucoside and suggests that the accompanying glucoside may belong to the xanthophyll
  group.
