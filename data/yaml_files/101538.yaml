revised_title: A Method for Determining the Diameters of Planets and Parallax of the
  Moon
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Planetary Science
tldr: M. Auzout describes a method for measuring the diameters of planets and determining
  the parallax of the Moon using observations of their vertical and horizontal diameters.
  He also discusses the effect of refraction on these measurements and the increase
  in the Moon's diameter during a solar eclipse.
