scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author refutes the claims made by Professors King and Rowney that the structure
  of Eozoon Canadense is solely the result of chemical and physical agencies. The
  author argues that the evidence of organic origin is still valid and that the structure
  of the Canadian Eozoon supports the claim of an organic origin.
