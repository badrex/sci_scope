revised_title: 'Sulphonic Acids and Sulphuric Acid as Hydrolytic Agents: A Discussion
  of the Constitution of Sulphuric and other Polybasic Acids and the Nature of Acids'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Acid-Base Chemistry
tldr: The authors discuss the constitution of sulphuric and other polybasic acids,
  arguing that they are not true dibasic acids and proposing a new understanding of
  their structure and properties. They also explore the nature of acids and their
  hydrolytic agents, including sulphonic acids and sulphuric acid.
topics:
- Sulphonic Acids
- Sulphuric Acid
- Hydrolytic Agents
- Acid Constitution
- Polybasic Acids
