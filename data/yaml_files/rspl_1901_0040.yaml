revised_title: Investigating the Electrical Conductivity of Air and Salt Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity of air and salt vapours,
  focusing on the relationship between temperature and conductivity. They find that
  the energy required to ionize air and salt vapours is of the same order of magnitude,
  suggesting that the ions involved are of the same nature in both cases.
topics:
- Electrical Conductivity
- Air Ionization
- Salt Vapour Conductivity
- Temperature Dependence
- Ionization Energy
