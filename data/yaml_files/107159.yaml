revised_title: Investigating the Cohesion of Fluids and Capillary Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The author examines the cohesion of fluids and capillary phenomena, exploring
  the principles behind the behavior of fluids in tubes and their interaction with
  solid surfaces. The study focuses on the tension at the surface of fluids and the
  effects of curvature on the forces acting on them.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Capillary Action
- Surface Tension
- Cohesion
- Fluid-Fluid Interactions
