revised_title: Optimal Construction of Water-Wheels for Maximum Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the most advantageous construction of water-wheels,
  focusing on the size and dimensions of float-boards to maximize their efficiency.
  The study considers factors such as the stream's velocity, the weight of the water,
  and the depth of the wheel, providing equations to determine the optimal dimensions
  for the greatest possible effect.
