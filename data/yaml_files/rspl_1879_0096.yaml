revised_title: On the Induction of Electric Currents in Infinite Plates and Spherical
  Shells
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the electric currents induced in infinite plates and
  spherical shells when exposed to varying magnetic systems and when rotating near
  a constant magnetic system. The study provides mathematical expressions for the
  vector potential and currents in these cases, contributing to the understanding
  of electromagnetic phenomena.
