revised_title: 'Short Period Solar and Meteorological Changes: A Study of Pressure
  Variations and Solar Activity'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors investigate short period solar and meteorological changes, focusing
  on pressure variations and their relationship with solar activity. They find a close
  connection between the frequency of solar prominences and changes in pressure, suggesting
  that solar activity influences atmospheric pressure and circulation, affecting the
  global meteorological conditions.
