scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This Croonian lecture by Benjamin Ward Richardson explores the phenomenon of
  muscular irritability after systemic death, examining the effects of cold, motor
  forces, blood supply, and chemical agents on muscle function. Richardson discusses
  the importance of understanding these processes to determine the cause of muscular
  motion and the factors that influence muscle irritability.
