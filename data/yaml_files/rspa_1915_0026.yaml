revised_title: 'Aerodynamics of Bent Planes: Lift and Drift in Fluid Motion'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerodynamics & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the fluid dynamics of bent planes, specifically in relation
  to aeroplane problems. They find that bent planes have a higher lift-to-drift ratio
  and are more efficient than their chords. The lift and drift also increase with
  the length of the front plane.
