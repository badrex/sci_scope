scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Naval Architecture
tldr: This paper investigates the wave-making resistance of ships through a systematic
  study of model experiments. The author analyzes the effects of wave interference
  at the bow and stern, proposing a formula for the resistance and examining the impact
  of various factors such as the length, displacement, and shape of the models. The
  results provide insights into the behavior of ships in water and help improve our
  understanding of their resistance and propulsion.
