revised_title: Investigating the Relative Distances of Clusters of Stars and the Power
  of Telescopes in Space
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geography & Star Clusters
tldr: Sir William Herschel investigates methods to determine the relative distances
  of star clusters and the limits of telescopes in space. He uses the equalization
  of starlight to ascertain distances and applies this method to various star clusters,
  including the Milky Way, to measure their depth in space.
