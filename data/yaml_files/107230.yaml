revised_title: Investigating the Precession of the Equinoxes through Compound Rotatory
  Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, investigates the precession of the equinoxes by
  examining compound rotatory motion and its effects on the Earth's spheroidal figure.
  He calculates the angular velocities and annual precession, providing a new approach
  to understanding this celestial phenomenon.
