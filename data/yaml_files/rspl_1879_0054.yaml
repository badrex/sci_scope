revised_title: 'On the Solubility of Solids in Gases: A Study of Critical Points and
  Gaseous Solutions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: This investigation examines the solubility of solids in gases and the behavior
  of substances at critical points. The authors develop a new apparatus to study the
  solubility of solids in liquids near their critical points and discover that solids
  can remain in solution or diffusion in the gaseous state even when the temperature
  is raised significantly above the critical point.
topics:
- Chemical Equilibria
- Phase Transitions
- Critical Points
- Gaseous Solutions
- Solubility
