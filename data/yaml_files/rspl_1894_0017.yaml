revised_title: The Decomposition of Ethylene under Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of ethylene under heat and finds that
  it yields hydrogen, methane, and liquid products. The results challenge previous
  theories on ethylene decomposition and provide insights into the actions taking
  place in the manufacture of coal gas and other processes of destructive distillation.
