scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geology
tldr: John Davy reports on the changes in the Mediterranean volcano's crater since
  his last communication to the Royal Society. He concludes that the crater was formed
  entirely by loose materials from volcanic action and not by rock from the sea bed.
  He also notes the close and oppressive heat in the area but believes it is not directly
  related to the volcano.
