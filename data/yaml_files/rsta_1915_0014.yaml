tldr: The paper investigates the conformal representation of regions in the plane
  with partially curvilinear boundaries, focusing on the extension of solvable problems
  in two-dimensional liquid motion. The author introduces conformal curve-factors
  and discusses their characteristics, linear range, and angular range, with applications
  to hydrodynamics.
