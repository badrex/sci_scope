revised_title: Confirmation of the Identity between Columbium and Tantalum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Wollaston's experiments confirm that columbium and tantalum are the same metal,
  providing a detailed analysis of their chemical properties and comparing them to
  other minerals. The specific gravities of the two minerals differ, but Wollaston
  concludes that this difference cannot be explained by variations in their chemical
  composition.
