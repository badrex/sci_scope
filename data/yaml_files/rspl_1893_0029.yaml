revised_title: Investigating the Thickness and Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid
  Films
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the thickness of black soap films
  formed from various liquid solutions using both optical and electrical methods.
  They found that the specific resistance of a film is not affected by its tenuity,
  and the specific conductivity is the same whether the liquid is examined in bulk
  or in the form of a thin film. The study also revealed that the electrical thickness
  of black films increases significantly when the proportion of dissolved salt is
  reduced.
