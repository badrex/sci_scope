revised_title: Determination of the British Association Unit of Resistance in Absolute
  Measure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author describes experiments conducted to determine the value of the British
  Association unit of resistance in absolute measure. The study involves a new, larger
  ring apparatus and improvements in the setup to reduce disturbances caused by air
  currents and magnetic influences. The results provide a more accurate determination
  of the unit of resistance.
