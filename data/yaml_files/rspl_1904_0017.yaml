scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace Engineering
tldr: This article investigates the longitudinal stability of aerial gliders, focusing
  on the effects of the angle of incidence and velocity. The authors develop equations
  to determine the conditions for stability and apply them to various glider configurations,
  including single-plane and two-plane systems. They find that the glider's velocity
  and angle of incidence play crucial roles in maintaining stability.
