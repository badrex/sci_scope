scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: Charles S. Wood's research on a new class of organic bases led to the discovery
  of ninaphthylamine, a substance formed through a unique substitution process involving
  binoxide of nitrogen. This finding expands the understanding of nitro-derivatives
  of aromatic monamines and offers new possibilities for further research in organic
  chemistry.
