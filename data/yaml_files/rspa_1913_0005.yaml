revised_title: A New Approach to Determining the Radiation Constant
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors describe a new experimental setup and method for determining the
  radiation constant, using a Heraeus furnace as an emitter and an aniline thermometer
  as a receiver. They discuss the challenges of creating a full radiator and receiver,
  and present preliminary results for further refinement.
topics:
- Radiation Constant
- Stefan-Boltzmann Law
- Furnace Design
- Thermal Radiation
- Energy Exchange
