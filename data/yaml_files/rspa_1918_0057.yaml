revised_title: The Polarization and Intensity of Light Scattered by Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the polarization and intensity of light scattered by
  gases, using a novel experimental setup and photographic methods. The results show
  that the scattered light is almost completely polarized, indicating that gas molecules
  have preferential directions of vibration.
