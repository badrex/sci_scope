revised_title: 'Experiments on the Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis: The Effects
  of High and Low Temperatures and Solar Rays'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Virology
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the effects of high and low temperatures,
  as well as direct solar rays, on the survival of Bacillus anthracis spores. The
  results show that spores are not killed by temperature alone, but are effectively
  inactivated by direct sunlight. Further research is being conducted to explore the
  connection between solar rays and bacterial inactivation.
