tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments conducted in the West Indies
  and North America to determine the relative magnetic forces in the years 1831, 32,
  and 33. The experiments were performed by James Napier, and the findings were used
  to compute the relative forces at different locations and create a table of the
  results.
