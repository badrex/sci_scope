revised_title: Condensation Nuclei Produced in Gases by the Action of Röntgen Rays,
  Uranium Rays, Ultra-Violet Light, and Other Agents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the formation of condensation nuclei in gases through
  various agents, such as Röntgen rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. The
  study reveals that nuclei produced by these agents require similar degrees of supersaturation
  for water to condense on them, and that they behave differently in an electric field,
  suggesting that they are either charged particles or uncharged nuclei.
