revised_title: The Ascent of Water between Two Glass Planes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Hydraulics
tldr: The author describes an experiment involving the ascent of water between two
  glass planes, which he believes can help determine the proportions of fluid attractions.
  He observes that the shape of the water's ascent approaches a hyperbola, but his
  apparatus was not precise enough to confirm this exactly.
