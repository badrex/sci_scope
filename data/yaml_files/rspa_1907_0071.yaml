revised_title: The Dispersion of Double Refraction in Relation to Crystal Structure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of double refraction in relation to crystal
  structure, examining the effects of mechanical stress, electric fields, and natural
  crystals. The study focuses on the optical properties of a homogeneous assemblage
  of molecules and their influence on the refractive indices of the medium.
