scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Numerical Methods
tldr: The author presents a new method for solving numerical equations of all orders
  using continuous approximation. This method is a universal instrument of calculation
  that can be applied to the composition and analysis of functions of every kind,
  particularly useful in solving equations.
