revised_title: Theorems on the Attraction of Ellipsoids for Various Laws of Force
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the attraction of ellipsoids for various laws of force,
  including inverse square and other power laws. They derive theorems and formulas
  for potential and attraction in different scenarios, such as homogeneous and heterogeneous
  ellipsoids, and provide examples and applications of their findings.
