scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Design
tldr: Walter Churchman presents a new water-raising engine that eliminates power loss
  and allows for adjustable stroke lengths. The engine is designed for animal-drawn
  mechanisms, enabling greater efficiency and productivity. The innovative design
  reduces friction, water waste, and maintenance costs, making it a valuable addition
  to water management systems.
