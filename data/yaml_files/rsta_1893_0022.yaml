revised_title: Differential Covariants of Plane Curves and Their Operators
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates the differential covariants of plane curves and their
  operators, focusing on the conditions that make a function a covariant function.
  They explore the relationship between covariants and matrices, and the transformation
  between reciprocal covariants.
