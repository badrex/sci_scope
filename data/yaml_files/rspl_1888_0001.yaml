revised_title: 'Suggestions on the Classification of Heavenly Bodies: Nebulae, Stars,
  and Their Variability'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Object Classification & Study
tldr: The author discusses the classification of various celestial bodies, such as
  nebulae, stars, and their variability, based on their forms and the meteoritic origin
  of these celestial bodies. He suggests that the luminosity of meteorites depends
  on collisions, and that visibility in space indicates the presence of matter and
  collisions.
