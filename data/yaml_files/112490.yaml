tldr: This study compares the results of atmospheric electricity observations at Kew
  Observatory and Windsor, Nova Scotia, revealing significant differences in diurnal
  and annual curves between the two locations. The research also presents the mean
  hourly values of electrical potential for each month and discusses the reduction
  of the obtained curves using harmonic series.
