tldr: Dr. Charles Preston and Monsieur Du Linier perform an autopsy on a nine-year-old
  boy who died suddenly from vomiting. They discover a polypus in the boy's heart
  and brain, as well as an inflamed pleura and a distended bladder. The cause of the
  boy's vomiting and death is conjectured to be related to these findings.
