revised_title: Comments on the Duration of Geological Periods and the Wobble of Earth's
  Axis
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author discusses the rate at which the Earth's axis wobble would be destroyed
  by ocean friction and the implications for determining the duration of geological
  periods. He also presents a geometrical proof that the axis of rotation will move
  on a cycloid if the axis of figure moves uniformly.
