  and Chemical Composition'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science
tldr: This study examines the electrical resistance of glass and its relationship
  with temperature, density, and chemical composition. The research finds that the
  specific resistance of glass decreases with increasing temperature and that the
  conductivity increases with age. The density of the glass also plays a significant
  role in its electrical resistance.
