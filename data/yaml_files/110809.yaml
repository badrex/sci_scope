tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Sir John F.W. Herschel describes an extraordinary
  luminous band in the sky, visible towards the southwest, stretching obliquely westward
  and downwards. The band remained fixed among the stars and was visible for over
  an hour. Herschel discusses the possibility of the phenomenon being the tail of
  a comet, whose head was below the horizon at the time of observation.
