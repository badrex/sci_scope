scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Physics & Observational Astronomy
tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates nebulous stars and their relationship
  to star clusters and cosmic objects. He discovers that some nebulous stars are not
  clusters of stars but rather distant, remote objects, challenging the previously
  held belief that all visible objects in the heavens were star clusters.
