revised_title: Influence of Cathode Material on Crookes Dark Space Length
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of various cathode materials on the length
  of the Crookes dark space in gas discharge tubes, finding that magnesium produces
  the shortest dark space and requires the lowest potential difference.
topics:
- Cathode dark space
- Cathode materials
- Electrical discharge
