revised_title: The Specific Heats of Metals and the Atomic Heat at Absolute Zero
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the specific heats of metals like aluminum, nickel,
  cobalt, silver, and platinum, and concludes that the assumption of constant atomic
  heat at absolute zero is not valid. The study also includes the specific heats of
  nickel and silver sulfides, providing evidence for the difference in their specific
  heat temperature influences.
