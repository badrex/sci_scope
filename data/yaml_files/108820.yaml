revised_title: 'The Aquiferous and Oviducal System in Lamellibranchiate Mollusks:
  A Study on Anodon and Unio Species'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the aquiferous and oviducal systems in lamellibranchiate
  mollusks, specifically Anodon and Unio species. They find that the orifices on either
  side of the foot lead to a system of tubes spread throughout the entire foot, and
  that the blood-vascular system does not directly communicate with this system or
  the punctated depressions along the foot-edge.
