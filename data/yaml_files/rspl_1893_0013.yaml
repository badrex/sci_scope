revised_title: 'The Electrolysis of Steam: A Reexamination of Perrot''s Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electrolysis of steam using an improved experimental
  setup and finds that the excess of hydrogen appears at the negative electrode, and
  the excess of oxygen at the positive electrode. The results differ from previous
  experiments, suggesting that the discharge through gases may involve chemical changes
  similar to those in electrolytes conveying currents.
