revised_title: 'Thermal Properties of Carbonic Acid at Low Temperatures: Throttling
  Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments to measure the thermal properties
  of carbonic acid at low temperatures. They use throttling experiments to check the
  accuracy of the gas-limit curve and constant-pressure curves, providing valuable
  data for refrigeration calculations.
topics:
- Thermal properties
- Carbonic acid
- Low temperatures
