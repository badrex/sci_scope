revised_title: Anatomical and Optical Structure of Animal Crystalline Lenses
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the structure and optical properties of crystalline lenses
  in various animals, observing complex arrangements of fibers and septa. He suggests
  that these structures may correct spherical aberration, but the purpose of other
  properties remains a mystery.
