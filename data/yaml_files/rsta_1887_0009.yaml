revised_title: 'Transmission of Sunlight through the Earth''s Atmosphere: A Study
  of Color Photometry'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere
  using color photometry and a modified spectroscope. The study reveals that the accuracy
  of readings can reach within 1% of the mean, and that the neighborhood of a big
  city like London is not unsuitable for making sunlight observations when the wind
  is in a suitable quarter.
