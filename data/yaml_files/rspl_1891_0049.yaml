revised_title: Determination of Critical Curves and Their Limiting Points in Ternary
  Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the properties of ternary alloys and their critical
  curves, determining the conditions under which mixtures separate into two different
  fluids. The study focuses on the graphical representation of these critical curves
  and the factors affecting their formation, such as the proportions of the constituents
  and the temperature.
