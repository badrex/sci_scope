scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The authors, George Rolleston and Charles Robertson, present their findings
  on the anatomy of the aquiferous and oviductal systems in Lamellibranchiate Mollusks.
  They argue against the commonly-received opinion on the outlet of the ovarian system
  and propose new views on the true oviducts. The paper is supported by detailed dissections
  and illustrations of the freshwater mussel, Anodonta cygnea.
