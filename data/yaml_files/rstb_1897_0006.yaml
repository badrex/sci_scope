revised_title: A Study of Decussating Tracts in the Mid- and Inter-Brain and the Pyramidal
  System in the Mesencephalon and Bulb
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The authors investigate the decussating tracts in the mid- and inter-brain and
  the pyramidal system in the mesencephalon and bulb using the Marchi method. They
  describe the upper and lower decussations of Forel and their relationship to the
  arcuate system of fibres, providing insights into the neural connections and pathways
  in the brain.
