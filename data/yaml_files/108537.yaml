scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author investigates the periodical laws in larger magnetic disturbances
  and finds a correspondence with the variation in frequency and magnitude of solar
  spots. The study examines the disturbances of magnetic declination and inclination
  at Toronto and Hobarton, revealing consistent patterns in the occurrence and aggregate
  values of the disturbances.
