revised_title: Anatomical Observations of the Alimentary Canal and Lymphatic Vessels
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The authors investigate the minute anatomy of the alimentary canal, focusing
  on the connective tissue and lymphatic vessels. They discover that connective tissue
  corpuscles are present among the epithelium, and the lining endothelium of lymph
  vessels is in anatomical continuity with the reticulum of nucleated cells. The study
  also reveals the process of fat absorption through connective tissue and its transportation
  to lymph vessels.
