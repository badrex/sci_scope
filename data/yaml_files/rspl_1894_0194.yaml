revised_title: 'Specific Resistance of Copper: A Study on Hard and Annealed Varieties'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the specific resistance of copper in both hard and annealed
  varieties, concluding that the limit of electrolytic purification has been reached.
  The mean specific resistance of pure copper is found to be 0.00415 C.G.S. units
  at 0Â°C.
