revised_title: 'On the Light Radiated by Heated Bodies: An Extension of Prevost''s
  Theory of Radiation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between heat radiation and light absorption
  in various materials, extending Prevost's theory of radiation and demonstrating
  that the radiation emitted by a substance is proportional to its absorptive capacity
  for heat and light of the same temperature.
topics:
- Heat Radiation
- Thermal Radiation
- Prevost's Theory of Radiation
- Melloni's Experiments
- Light Absorption and Emission
