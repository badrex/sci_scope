revised_title: A Reassessment of the Specific Heat of Water and the Position of the
  Minimum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors analyze the specific heat of water and compare their findings with
  previous studies, particularly focusing on the position of the minimum specific
  heat. They argue that their results, which indicate a minimum at around 4°C, are
  more accurate and consistent with other observations than those of Callendar and
  Barnes.
