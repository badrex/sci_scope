tldr: The author investigates the transparency of the atmosphere and the law of extinction
  of solar rays in passing through it. He discusses the difficulties in measuring
  light and heat and the historical context of the problem, concluding that the intensity
  of light is reduced in a logarithmic curve as it passes through the atmosphere.
