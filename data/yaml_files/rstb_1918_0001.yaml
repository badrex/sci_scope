  System and Circulation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Pharmacology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of cobra venom on the peripheral nervous
  system and central nervous system, as well as its impact on circulation and respiratory
  failure. They find that small doses of venom cause slow peripheral paralysis similar
  to curare, while larger doses lead to rapid paralysis and circulation failure. The
  study provides insight into the complex actions of cobra venom and its potential
  applications in pharmacology.
