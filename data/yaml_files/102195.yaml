revised_title: 'Dr. Papin''s New Water-Engine: A Proposed Improvement by W. Tenon'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machines
tldr: W. Tenon presents an alternative design for Dr. Papin's water engine, suggesting
  a modification to the existing design that utilizes a cylindrical vessel, pipes,
  and bladders to create a perpetual pumping motion. The improved water engine would
  continuously pump water into the inner vessel and force air out through pipes, creating
  a steady stream of water.
