tldr: The author describes the removal and preservation of the Newtonian Dial, a historical
  monument located at Woolsthorpe, the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton. The dial was
  marked on a stone at the Manor-house of Woolsthorpe and had the name 'NEWTON' inscribed
  on it. The gnomon, however, had disappeared many years prior to the author's account.
