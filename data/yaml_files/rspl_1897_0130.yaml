revised_title: Investigating the Extra Lines in Helium Stars Spectra and Oxygen Comparison
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author examines the extra lines in the spectra of helium stars and compares
  them to the oxygen spectrum. The study reveals a close correspondence between the
  extra lines and the oxygen spectrum, suggesting that the first division of helium
  stars' spectra is due to hydrogen, helium, and oxygen.
