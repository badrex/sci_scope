revised_title: A Method for Accurately Determining the Time of Tides
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the precise time of tides based
  on the moon's position, providing a more accurate approach than existing methods
  that rely solely on the moon's distance from the sun or compass direction. This
  method can be used to create tide tables for any location, improving navigation
  and understanding of tidal patterns.
