  of Folds in Flexible Materials

scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the instability of tubes subjected to end pressure and
  the formation of folds in flexible materials. The study reveals that tubes can become
  unstable by crumpling up their walls, while plates may experience instability when
  pressure is applied to opposite edges. The author also explores the formation of
  symmetrical folds in tubes and the potential energy involved in their deformation.
