scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments on the brains of monkeys, focusing
  on the effects of localized brain lesions on various functions and sensory systems.
  The author details 25 experiments and their outcomes, including the effects of ablation
  on intelligence, motor function, sensory perception, and more. The study provides
  insights into the localization of brain functions and the role of specific brain
  regions in sensory processing.
