revised_title: In-depth Study of Excised Mammalian Heart's Action and Electrical Properties
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the action and electrical properties of excised mammalian
  hearts, focusing on spontaneous and excited contractions, the role of temperature,
  and the direction of electrical currents. The research reveals that excised hearts
  can have longer contractions and latent periods, and that electrical variations
  can be detected even after visible contractions have ceased.
