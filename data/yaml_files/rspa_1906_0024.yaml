scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of light on galvanic cells, exploring the
  chemical statics and dynamics of reversible and irreversible systems. The research
  demonstrates that the velocity of chemical reactions and chemical equilibrium in
  homogeneous systems follow the laws of mass action under the influence of light.
  Additionally, the study provides evidence that the electromotive force (EMF) produced
  by light in these systems consists of two components: one created by light at a
  constant temperature due to the variation of chemical potential, and a thermo-EMF
  produced by the effect of temperature on the chemical potential.'
