revised_title: On X-rays and the Theory of Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The author discusses the nature of X-rays and the processes resulting in their
  emission, focusing on scattered radiation, fluorescent X-rays, and primary X-rays.
  The experimental results support the transverse wave theory and provide evidence
  against the energy quantum theory. The author also explains the constitution of
  atoms and the scattering of X-rays by electrons.
