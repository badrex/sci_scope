tldr: The author introduces the concept of complete differential coefficients and
  determinants in lines, and applies them to analytical mechanics. The article demonstrates
  how these concepts can be used to represent velocity and acceleration in terms of
  differential coefficients of the radius vector, and provides formulas for calculating
  these coefficients.
