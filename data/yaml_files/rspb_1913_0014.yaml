revised_title: 'Distinguishing Between Trypanosoma brucei Strains: Zululand and Uganda'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors examine two strains of Trypanosoma brucei, Zululand and Uganda,
  and find that they have distinct morphological differences. The Zululand strain
  is monomorphic, while the Uganda strain is dimorphic, with both long and stumpy
  forms present. This distinction has implications for understanding the distribution
  and characteristics of the disease caused by these parasites.
