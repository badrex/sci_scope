  Blood Changes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of sugar on muscle energy production and
  the changes in blood composition during acute local inflammations. The study shows
  that sugar increases muscle energy production and alters the blood's cellular composition,
  including the number and ratios of hemiacellular leukocytes.
