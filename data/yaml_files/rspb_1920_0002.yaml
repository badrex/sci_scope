scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates the vegetative morphology of Pistia Stratiotes and the
  Lemnaceae, concluding that the leaf-limb of Pistia represents a petiolar phyllode,
  and the distal part of the frond of the Lemnaceae is also a petiolar phyllode, similar
  to Pistia. The author also examines the development of buds in Pistia and the Lemnaceae,
  finding that they form in pockets within the plant's structure.
