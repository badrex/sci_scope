scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Respiratory System
tldr: The author examines the role of the lungs in cooling and condensing blood, analyzing
  the capacity of pulmonary vessels and the heart. The study suggests that while blood
  is indeed cooled during inspiration, it is also mixed, attenuated, and expanded
  during expiration, challenging the traditional view of the lungs' function.
