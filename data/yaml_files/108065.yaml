tldr: 'The author, W. Snow Harris, investigates the elementary laws of electricity
  and presents two new electrical instruments: an electroscope that acts on the principle
  of divergence and an electrometer that measures the attractive force of an electrified
  body. These instruments help improve our understanding of electrical phenomena and
  contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.'
