  Germination
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the role of the endosperm in the germination process
  of Hordeum vulgare, discovering that the endosperm is a passive storehouse of reserve
  materials, with the embryo being responsible for the digestion and depletion of
  these materials.
