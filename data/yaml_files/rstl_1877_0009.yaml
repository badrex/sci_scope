revised_title: The Action of Light on Selenium and Its Thermoelectric Properties
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of light on selenium and discover that exposure
  to light reduces its electrical resistance. They also find that selenium can be
  used as a thermometer due to its sensitivity to temperature changes. The change
  in resistance is found to be proportional to the square root of the illuminating
  power of the light.
