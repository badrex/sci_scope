revised_title: A Method for Raising Infinite Multinomials to Any Given Power or Extracting
  Any Given Root
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a method for raising an infinite multinomial to any given
  power or extracting any given root, extending the concept of the binomial theorem
  to multinomials. The method involves dividing products into classes, multiplying
  and dividing by specific terms, and considering the sum of units in the indices
  of the letters.
