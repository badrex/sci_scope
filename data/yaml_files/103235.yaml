tldr: The author discusses the discovery of Roman coins in Yorkshire and their potential
  significance for understanding the Roman Empire's presence in the region. The coins,
  dating back to the reigns of Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian, provide evidence
  of the Roman Via Vicinalis passing through the area and suggest that the region
  may have been inhabited during the Roman Empire's prime.
