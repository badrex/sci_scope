revised_title: 'Interference Bands and Tree Growth: A Novel Method for Measuring Girth
  Expansion'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Forestry & Tree Biology
tldr: The author develops a method using interference bands to measure the growth
  of trees, finding that growth is most rapid when temperatures are lowest and is
  affected by rain. This method could provide valuable insights into tree growth and
  environmental factors.
