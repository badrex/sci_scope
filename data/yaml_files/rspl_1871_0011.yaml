revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Refracting Medium on Astronomical Aberration
  of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to examine the effect of a refracting medium
  on the amount of astronomical aberration of light. Using a vertical telescope filled
  with water, the author observes the meridional zenith distance of y Draconis and
  finds that the hypothesis of Professor Klinkerfues is not supported, as the true
  aberration is the same as the received aberration.
