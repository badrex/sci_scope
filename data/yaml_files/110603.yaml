scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Psychology
tldr: Charles Wheatstone investigates the phenomenon of binocular vision and demonstrates
  how two dissimilar perspective projections can be combined by the mind to create
  a three-dimensional perception. He also invents the stereoscope, an apparatus that
  allows the observer to view these combined projections without strain or fatigue,
  and discusses its implications for understanding visual perception.
