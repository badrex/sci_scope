revised_title: Investigation of Homogeneous Röntgen Rays Passage through Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author develops a new Röntgen ray bulb to study the passage of homogeneous
  rays through gases. The research investigates the absorption of these rays, the
  variation of ionization with pressure, and the ionization, relative to air, produced
  in a gas by rays of different hardnesses.
