revised_title: Direct Measurement of the Chemical Action of Sunlight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: Bunsen and Roscoe developed a method to measure the chemical action of sunlight
  by using photographic paper and a pendulum device. They found that equal shades
  of blackness produced by light of different intensities acting for different times
  cannot be used as a basis for their measurement method.
