  Line Analogy
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Statistics
tldr: The author, John Robertson, provides an explanation of Dr. Halley's demonstration
  of the analogy between logarithmic tangents and the meridian line in navigation.
  He discusses the proportional spiral, logarithmic spirals, and the relationship
  between rhumb lines and logarithmic tangents in a Mercator's chart.
