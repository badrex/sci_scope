scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author analyzes magnetic declination observations made at the Government
  Observatory in Bombay from 1859 to 1865. The study reveals systematic diurnal variations,
  a semiannual inequality, and a solar-diurnal inequality in declination. The findings
  contribute to understanding the magnetic field's behavior and its variations over
  time.
