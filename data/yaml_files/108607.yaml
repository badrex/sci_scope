  Variations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the existence of the decennial inequality in solar-diurnal
  and lunar-diurnal magnetic variations using Hobarton's magnetic observations. The
  study confirms the existence of the decennial period in solar-diurnal variations
  and its non-existence in lunar-diurnal variations.
