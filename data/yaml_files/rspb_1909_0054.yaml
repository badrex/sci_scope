revised_title: A Critical Examination of Sachs' Method for Measuring Carbon Dioxide
  Assimilation in Leaves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the accuracy and limitations of Sachs' dry-weight method
  for measuring photosynthesis in leaves, finding that the method is not entirely
  reliable due to errors from asymmetry and changes in leaf area. However, the method
  is still useful for measuring total photosynthetic activity in leaves under natural
  conditions.
