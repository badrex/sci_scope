revised_title: 'Dynamic Osmotic Pressures: A New Method for Measuring Osmotic Pressures'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring osmotic pressures by observing
  the rate at which water flows into a solution. They find that the rate is proportional
  to the equilibrium osmotic pressure and can be used to measure osmotic pressures
  in dilute solutions. The method involves using a semi-permeable membrane and applying
  hydrostatic pressure to the solution.
