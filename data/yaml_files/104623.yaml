revised_title: Investigating the Phenomenon of Glass-Drops and the Principle of Tempering
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author explores the phenomenon of glass-drops, or Lacrymae Batavicae, and
  investigates the process of tempering and annealing glass. He discovers that the
  key to understanding the behavior of glass-drops lies in the glass-making process
  and the management of the glass particles and their interactions with heat and air.
