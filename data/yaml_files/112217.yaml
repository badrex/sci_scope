revised_title: Mechanico-Chemical Explanation of Distorted Skulls at Wroxeter
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Chemistry & Archaeology
tldr: The author investigates the distorted skulls found at Wroxeter and concludes
  that pressure alone cannot explain the deformities. He suggests that the acidity
  of the soil, specifically the presence of carbonic and nitric acids, plays a significant
  role in dissolving and softening the bones, leading to the distortion.
