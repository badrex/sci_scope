scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of waves in liquids, focusing on the relationship
  between wave height, horizontal disturbance, and virtual depth. The study demonstrates
  that the velocity of wave advance is equal to the velocity acquired by a body falling
  through half the virtual depth, regardless of the type of wave or the depth of the
  liquid.
