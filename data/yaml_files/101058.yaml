  of Sap
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Science & Botany
tldr: The authors investigate the bleeding of trees, particularly sycamores, and the
  circulation of sap in trees. They explore the effects of frost and weather on sap
  movement and discuss possible explanations for these phenomena. They also examine
  the anatomy and physiology of plants, including the structure of plant vessels and
  the behavior of sap in different parts of a plant.
