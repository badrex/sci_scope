tldr: In 1601, a large area in Pembroke-shire, Wales, was suddenly covered in a mysterious
  green worm-like creature. These creatures moved en masse up a hill, consuming the
  grass and attracting birds and crows that eventually devoured them. The author,
  Edward Floyd, shares this account from a historical document by George Owen.
