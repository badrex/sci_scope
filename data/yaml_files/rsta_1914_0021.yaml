revised_title: Investigating the Capacity for Heat of Metals at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the heat capacity of metals at low temperatures using
  a constant temperature enclosure and the Joule-Thomson cooling effect. They focus
  on the specific heats of metals such as silver, lead, and sodium, and compare their
  experimental results with theoretical predictions based on the quantum theory.

- Low Temperature Physics
- Heat Capacity
