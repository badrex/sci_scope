scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Vision Science
tldr: Dr. Wells investigates the effects of belladonna on eye adaptation and vision,
  discovering that the power of adapting the eye to different distances is not dependent
  on external muscles but rather the crystalline lens. He also observes that the sympathy
  between the eyes is actually sympathy of the retina.
