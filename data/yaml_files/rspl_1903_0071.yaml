revised_title: Correction to the Radium Spectrum Paper
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: Sir W. Crookes corrects his previous paper on the spectrum of radium, identifying
  that a faint line previously attributed to radium was actually due to aluminum.
  He also discusses the inability of radium stimulation to elicit characteristic line
  spectra from bromine or radium molecules, and suggests further experiments on helium
  molecules.
