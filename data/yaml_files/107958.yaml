revised_title: On the Simplification of Physical Astronomy and the Perturbations of
  Planets
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of planetary perturbations on the elliptic
  orbit of a disturbed planet, proposing a new method to simplify physical astronomy
  by using the principles of dynamics and reducing the need for complex formulas.
topics:
- Celestial Mechanics
- Planetary Perturbations
- Differential Equations
- Orbital Mechanics
- Astronomy
