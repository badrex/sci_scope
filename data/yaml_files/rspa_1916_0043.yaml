revised_title: Investigating the Bunsen Flame Spectra of Metallic Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the Bunsen flame spectra of metallic vapours, focusing
  on the fundamental frequencies emitted by elements such as mercury, zinc, cadmium,
  magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium. They find that the Bunsen flame can stimulate
  the fundamental frequencies of these elements, with the exception of zinc.
