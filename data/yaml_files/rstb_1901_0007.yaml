scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of fossil plants from the Palaeozoic
  rocks, specifically the seed-like fructification of Lepidocarpon, a genus of lycopodiaceous
  cones from the Carboniferous formation. The discovery of this strobilus challenges
  previous understanding of plant reproduction and evolution.
