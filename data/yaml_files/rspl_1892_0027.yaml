revised_title: On the Simultaneity of Magnetic Variations and Earth Current Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author investigates the simultaneity of magnetic variations at different
  locations during magnetic disturbances and examines the relationship between magnetic
  and earth current phenomena. The study compares the times of initial magnetic movements
  at various observatories and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding
  the relationship between magnetic disturbances and earth currents.
