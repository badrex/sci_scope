scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Henry Cavendish investigates the composition of air and the nature of phlogiston
  through a series of experiments. He finds that phlogistication does not produce
  fixed air and that the diminution of common air is not due to the generation or
  separation of fixed air. He also examines the conversion of nitrous and vitriolic
  acids into dephlogisticated air and the solubility of selenite in water.
