revised_title: Experiments on the Formation of Volatile Alkali and the Affinities
  of Phlogisticated and Light Inflammable Airs
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Alkali Formation
tldr: The author investigates the formation of volatile alkali and the affinities
  of phlogisticated and light inflammable airs through a series of experiments. The
  findings suggest that the combination of these two airs and the formation of volatile
  alkali depend on the proximity of their particles and their attraction to each other.
