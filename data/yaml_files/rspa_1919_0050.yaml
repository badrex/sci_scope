scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between wind and pressure distribution,
  focusing on the effects of friction and other factors on the deviation of actual
  wind from the geostrophic wind. The results show that friction is the dominant cause
  of the difference between the two, and that the vertical distribution of turbulence
  plays a significant role in this relationship.
