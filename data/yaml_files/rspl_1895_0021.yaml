tldr: This paper by General J.T. Walker summarizes the geodetic operations in India,
  focusing on the Great Trigonometrical Survey and the influence of local deflections
  on the plumb line. The author discusses the discrepancies between astronomical and
  geodetic determinations and suggests combining astronomical observations in groups
  to eliminate errors caused by deflections.
