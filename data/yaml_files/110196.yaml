tldr: The author describes a differential barometer capable of measuring small differences
  in barometric pressure. The instrument can be used for various purposes, including
  determining the force of heated air in chimneys and as an anemometer to measure
  wind speed. The sensitivity of the instrument can be adjusted by mixing alcohol
  with water.
