tldr: This study examines the relationship between stature and brain weight, finding
  that shorter individuals have a larger proportion of brain mass compared to their
  height. The research also shows that the influence of sex, age, occupation, education,
  and disease on brain weight must consider the effect of stature to avoid errors
  in estimates.
