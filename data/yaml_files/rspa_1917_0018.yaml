revised_title: 'Selective Properties of Copper Ferrocyanide Membrane: Experimental
  Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloidal Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the selective properties of the copper ferrocyanide
  membrane by immersing it in cane-sugar solutions of varying concentrations. The
  results confirm the adsorption hypothesis, as the membrane is permeable to water
  and not to cane sugar due to selective adsorption.
