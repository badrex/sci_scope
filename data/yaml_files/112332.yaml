tldr: The author extends their previous research on peroxides of organic radicals,
  investigating new peroxides of nitro-benzoyl, cumenyl, butyl, and valeryl. They
  also study the reaction of barium peroxide on bibasic anhydrides, revealing powerful
  oxidizing properties and providing insights into the properties of organic compounds
  and their analogies to inorganic substances.
