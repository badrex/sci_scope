scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the conditions for multiple contact between quadrics
  and other surfaces, focusing on the cases of three-, four-, five-, and six-pointic
  contact. The paper also discusses the corresponding problem for cubics and the existence
  of points of four-, five-, and six-pointic single contact.
