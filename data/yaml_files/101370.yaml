revised_title: Effluviums, Flame, and the Perviousness of Glass
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author discusses the nature and effects of effluviums, experiments to make
  fire and flame stable and ponderable, and the perviousness of glass to ponderable
  parts of flame. The experiments provide insights into the properties of fire, the
  potential corporeality of light, and the behavior of substances when exposed to
  fire.
