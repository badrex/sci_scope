revised_title: The Chromatophore Structure and Color Changes in Higher Crustacea
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the chromatophore structure and color changes in higher
  crustaceans, particularly in Hippolyte. The authors describe the formation of pigments
  and the presence of colorless globules of fat in the chromatophores, which serve
  as a reserve food material. They also discuss the animals' sensitivity to light
  and their ability to change color based on their environment.
topics:
- Chromatophores
- Color Physiology
- Crustacea
- Light Sensitivity
- Color Change Mechanism
