revised_title: Investigating the Conducting Powers of Metallic Substances in Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author, William Snow Harris, examines the conducting powers of various metallic
  substances in electricity. He proposes a principle to estimate these powers based
  on the heat evolved during the passage of an electric charge through them. The experiments
  involve comparing the conducting powers of copper, silver, gold, zinc, platinum,
  iron, tin, and lead, as well as their alloys. The results show that the conducting
  powers of metals are affected by their alloys and that very small quantities of
  alloy can significantly influence the conducting power.
