revised_title: The Impact of Marshy Situations on Mortality Rates
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Health & Epidemiology
tldr: In a letter to Dr. Horsley, Dr. Richard Price presents evidence from a 15-year
  mortality rate study in a marshy parish in Switzerland, showing that inhabitants
  in this area have significantly lower life expectancy and higher mortality rates
  compared to those in hilly areas. Price suggests that establishing similar mortality
  registers in the UK could help determine the impact of different environments on
  life expectancy.
