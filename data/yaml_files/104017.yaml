revised_title: A New Design for a Catoptric Microscope
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author, Robert Barker, presents a new design for a catoptric microscope
  that addresses the limitations of dioptric microscopes. The new microscope, modeled
  after the Newtonian telescope, offers improved magnification, better visibility,
  and the ability to observe small parts of large objects without division.
