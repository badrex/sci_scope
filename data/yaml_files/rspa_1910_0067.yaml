revised_title: The Effect of Wall Surface on Heat Loss in Gaseous Explosions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the effect of wall surface on heat loss in gaseous explosions
  by comparing the cooling rates of silver-lined vessels with polished and blackened
  surfaces. The results show that polished surfaces have a slower cooling rate, indicating
  that radiation plays a significant role in heat loss.
