revised_title: 'Spectroscopic Observations of the Sun: The Discovery of a New Solar
  Envelope'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics
tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, investigates the solar spectrum using a new spectroscope
  and discovers a new solar envelope containing bright lines coinciding with the Fraunhofer
  lines. This envelope is found to be uniform in thickness, except in regions with
  prominences, and helps clarify the behavior of the F line in the solar spectrum.
