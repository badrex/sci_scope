revised_title: Investigation of Secondary Cathode Particle Velocities in Röntgen Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiation & Particle Physics
tldr: This study examines the velocities of secondary cathode particles ejected by
  characteristic Röntgen rays and compares experimental curves for different cathode
  materials. The results suggest that the velocities are constant and related to the
  nature of the cathode.
