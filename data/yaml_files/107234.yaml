revised_title: Investigation of the General Term in the Inverse Method of Finite Differences
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The authors investigate the general term of a series in the inverse method of
  finite differences, providing a simple law of progression and a formula for the
  case of n=1. The findings can be applied to the summation of series, investigation
  of recurring series, and other mathematical purposes.
