revised_title: 'The Continuity of Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter: A Study on
  Carbonic Acid'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the continuity between the gaseous and liquid states
  of matter, specifically focusing on carbonic acid. By applying high pressure and
  varying temperatures, Andrews demonstrates that carbonic acid can be partially liquefied,
  and discusses the implications of this finding on the understanding of phase transitions
  and the properties of gases and liquids.
