revised_title: A Further Investigation of Voltaic Action and Electromotive Forces
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the difference of potential in metals in contact and
  proposes a theory that the observed potential is due to the chemical action of a
  film of condensed vapor or gas on the metal surfaces. The author also discusses
  the design and use of a bi-metallic quadrant electrometer to measure the potential
  differences.
