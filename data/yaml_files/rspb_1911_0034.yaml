scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the development of Trypanosoma gambiense, the parasite
  responsible for sleeping sickness, in the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis. They discover
  that the trypanosomes undergo a complex developmental process within the fly, with
  varying success rates in different individuals. The study provides insights into
  the life cycle of the parasite and potential avenues for controlling its transmission.
