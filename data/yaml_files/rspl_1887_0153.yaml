  Study with Spinal Nerves'

scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the structure, function, and distribution of cranial
  nerves, comparing them to spinal nerves. They find that cranial nerves have anterior
  and posterior roots, similar to spinal nerves, and that their ganglia conform to
  the same plan. The study provides insights into the evolutionary relationship between
  cranial and spinal nerves and their functions in the nervous system.
