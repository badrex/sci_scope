revised_title: Chemical Combination and Toxic Action in Hemolytic Sera
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical combination and toxic action of hemolytic
  sera, focusing on immune-bodies and complements. They find that the efficiency of
  different complements in haemolytic reactions depends on both their combining affinities
  and toxicity, and that the highest dosage of complement occurs when used against
  its own corpuscles.
