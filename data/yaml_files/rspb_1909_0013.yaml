  of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Development
tldr: This study investigates the cholesterol content in eggs and newly-hatched chicks,
  finding that there is no significant increase in cholesterol during the transition
  from egg to chick. The researchers conclude that cholesterol is not synthesized
  in the animal organism and is likely conserved throughout the animal's life.
