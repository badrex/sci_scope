revised_title: The Analogy between Lesage's Theory of Gravitation and the Repulsion
  of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Gravitation
tldr: The author investigates the analogy between Lesage's theory of gravitation and
  the repulsion of light, considering the bombardment of particles and the pressure
  on surfaces. The study reveals the effects of normal and tangential components of
  the momentum communicated by impacts, and the pressure on surfaces exposed to bombardment.
