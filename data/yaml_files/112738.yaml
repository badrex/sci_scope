revised_title: Magnetic Disturbances and Terrestrial Galvanic Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between magnetic disturbances and terrestrial
  galvanic currents using data from the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. He finds a
  close agreement between the irregularities of the two phenomena, with galvanic irregularities
  usually preceding magnetic ones. The study also reveals a constant turn towards
  the north and a larger force towards the west in the galvanic currents.
