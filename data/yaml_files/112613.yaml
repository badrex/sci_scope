revised_title: Anatomy and Function of the Fovea Centralis in the Human Retina
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Vision Science
tldr: This study examines the structure and function of the fovea centralis in the
  human retina, including the roles of cones and rods, the primitive bacillary fibers,
  and the relationship between the inner granules and ganglion cells. The findings
  suggest that the fovea centralis is highly sensitive due to the increased number
  of cones and rods, and the structure of the retina supports efficient light reception
  and processing.
