  Animals

tldr: This article explores the relationship between muscle innervation, posture,
  and reflex movements in spinal animals. Sherrington observes that the direction
  of reflex movements can be influenced by the initial posture of the limb, suggesting
  that the spinal condition and reaction are affected by the posture already present
  in the limb at the time of stimulus application.
