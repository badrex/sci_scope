  of Venous, Arterial Pressure, and Pulse Rate'

scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the dog's heart to determine the maximum
  volume of blood sent out by the left ventricle in a single beat and studied the
  influence of variations in venous pressure, arterial pressure, and pulse rate on
  the heart's work. They found that the most important factor in calculating the work
  done by the heart is the quantity of blood forced from the ventricles at each systole.
