scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author examines the muscular fibers of fish, specifically cod and perch,
  and discovers a complex network of small vessels within the fibers. These vessels
  are responsible for nourishing the muscles and connecting them to bones, providing
  a unique structure compared to land animals.
