revised_title: 'Decomposition of Muriatic Acid: Effects of Electricity on Muriatic
  Acid Gas'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of muriatic acid using electricity
  and discovers that the electric fluid can separate water components and promote
  the union of evolved oxygen with muriatic acid. The experiments reveal that the
  hydrogenous gas evolved has its origin from the water attached to the muriatic acid,
  and the electric fluid's agency plays a role in the oxidation of mercury.
