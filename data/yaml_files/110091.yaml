revised_title: Influence of Nerves and Ganglions on Animal Heat
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Neurobiology
tldr: Sir Everard Home investigates the relationship between nerves, ganglions, and
  animal heat. He observes that animals with ganglions have a higher temperature than
  those without, and suggests that ganglionic nerves may play a role in generating
  heat. He also notes the connection between the abundance of placental nerves and
  the potential for the uterus to generate heat during labor.
