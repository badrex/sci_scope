  Waters

scientific_subdiscipline: Aquatic Ecology & Water Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effects of vegetation, animal life, and season on
  the composition of carbonate-of-lime waters in an aquarium. The study reveals that
  the presence of submerged vegetation helps maintain waters rich in carbonate of
  lime in a softened state, while the respiration of fish generates carbonic acid,
  which is absorbed by the plants under sunlight. The findings have implications for
  maintaining healthy water sources for domestic and aquatic life.
