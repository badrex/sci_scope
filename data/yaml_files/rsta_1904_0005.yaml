revised_title: Investigating the Mechanical Forces Acting on a Charged Electric Condenser
  Moving Through Space
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanical forces acting on a charged electric condenser
  moving through space to determine if there is a relative motion between the earth
  and the aether. They design and conduct experiments to eliminate various disturbances
  and measure the effects of the condenser's orientation and the time of day on its
  movement.
