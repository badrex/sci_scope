tldr: The authors investigate the morphology, length, and distribution of Trypanosoma
  pecorum in domestic animals in Nyasaland, finding that it affects various species
  and has an average length of 14.2 microns. They also note the presence of Trypanosoma
  brucei in a mixed infection, which may have broken down the rat's immunity to T.
  pecorum.
