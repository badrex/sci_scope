scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Telecommunications & Signal Processing
tldr: The author proposes a new telegraphic system using a regulated galvanic battery
  and a modified galvanometer for rapid signaling. The system aims to increase the
  speed of communication, especially for long submarine lines, and could potentially
  reach up to five or six distinct letters per second.
