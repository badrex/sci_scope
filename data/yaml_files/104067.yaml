  and Hyacinths
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author describes an experiment where tulips, narcissus, and hyacinths are
  grown on glasses of water and in soil to study their flowering process. The results
  show that water-grown plants flower earlier and have a faster evaporation rate when
  soil is added. Tulips and narcissus require more time to flower compared to hyacinths.
