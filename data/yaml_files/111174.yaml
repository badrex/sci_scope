revised_title: Examination of Diffraction Experiments and their Implications on the
  Undulatory Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Wave-Optics
tldr: The author, Baden Powell, examines various diffraction experiments and their
  implications on the undulatory theory. He discusses the experimental evidence and
  concludes that the phenomena presented are generally consistent with the undulatory
  theory, but further analytical investigations are needed for a more precise quantitative
  explanation.
