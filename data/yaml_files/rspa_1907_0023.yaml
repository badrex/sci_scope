revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Heat Loss in Explosions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The author develops a recording calorimeter using a continuous copper strip
  to measure heat loss during and after explosions. The device records the rise in
  resistance of the copper strip, allowing for the calculation of heat loss without
  relying on specific heat values. This method can be applied to various types of
  explosions and has implications for understanding combustion processes.
