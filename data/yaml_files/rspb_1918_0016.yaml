revised_title: The Effect of Rhythm and Stimulus Intensity on Reflex Nervous Discharge
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the response of spinal reflex centers to single and
  rhythmic nerve stimulation, finding that reflex nervous discharge can be both single-volley
  and repetitive depending on the stimulus intensity. They also discover that the
  reflex center can follow the full frequency rate of afferent nerve stimulation up
  to 55 per second.
