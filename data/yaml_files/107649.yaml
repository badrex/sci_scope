revised_title: On the Application of Condensed Gases as Mechanical Agents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the potential of condensed gases, such as muriatic acid
  and sulphuretted hydrogen, as mechanical agents. They find that these gases can
  exert immense elastic forces when subjected to small changes in temperature, making
  them useful in various applications, including steam engines and mechanical power
  generation.
