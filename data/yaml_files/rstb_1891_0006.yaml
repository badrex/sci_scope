revised_title: 'On the Mammalian Nervous System and its Functions: Localisation Determined
  by an Electrical Method'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the mammalian nervous system's functions and localisation
  using electrical methods, focusing on the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. They
  employ Lippmann's electrometer and galvanometer to study the excitatory processes
  in nerve fibers and determine the relationship between cortical centers, efferent
  fibers, and bulbo-spinal centers.
