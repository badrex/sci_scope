revised_title: The Behavior of Scattering Media in Fully Diffused Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of scattering media in fully diffused light,
  focusing on the rejectance, transmittance, and obstructance properties. They develop
  equations to describe the relationships between these properties and explore their
  implications for practical photometry.
