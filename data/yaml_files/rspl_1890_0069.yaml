revised_title: 'Magnetic Action on Light: A Theoretical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of magnetism on light using non-metallic
  substances and develops a theoretical explanation based on Professor Rowland's electromagnetic
  theory. The study reveals that the reflected light is elliptically polarized, and
  the results agree with Dr. Kerr's experiments in several aspects.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Magnetism and Light
- Polarized Light
- Reflection and Refraction
- Magnetic Materials
