revised_title: 'Contribution to the Theory of Attraction: Attraction Law Varying as
  the Power of Distance'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The authors investigate the potential at a point due to an attracting mass with
  a density varying as the power of the distance. They develop a theorem that determines
  the potential at a point on the axis of symmetry for various cases, expanding on
  the understanding of attraction laws.
