revised_title: Electrical Insulation and Phenomena in High Vacua
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromechanics
tldr: The author investigates electrical insulation and phenomena in high vacua using
  gold leaves and a bulb. The experiments reveal that the excited ebonite has a greater
  effect on the gold leaves at high vacua, and the divergence of the leaves is due
  to their mutual repulsion and attraction to the electrified glass.
