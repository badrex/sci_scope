tldr: Dr. Edward Tyson presents a case study of a patient with a rare bladder condition
  involving multiple cysts filled with a nutrient-rich fluid. The patient's bladder
  was distended with these cysts, which prevented the normal flow of urine. The condition
  was likely caused by the tenacity of the matter between the bladder membranes.
