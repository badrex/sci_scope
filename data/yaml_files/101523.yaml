tldr: The author presents a case of petrification in an elm tree in Wadley, near Farrington
  in Berks. The tree has a hollow trunk and a petrified crust on the inside, which
  is believed to have formed due to the flow of sap being petrified by the air. The
  phenomenon is discussed in relation to the surrounding environment and geological
  context.
