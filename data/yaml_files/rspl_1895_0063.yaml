revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of 8 Cephei Class Variable Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the spectra of five variable stars in the 8 Cephei class
  and finds that they all have identical spectra, indicating a common origin. The
  stars are found to be increasing in temperature and are believed to be meteor-swarms
  not yet fully condensed. The study also reveals that there is a general weakening
  of the continuous spectrum as the light of the star decreases.
