revised_title: Investigation of Sea-Water Specific Gravity, Temperature, and Salinity
  in Different Ocean Regions
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Chemistry
tldr: Alexander Marcet examines the specific gravity and temperature of sea-water
  from various parts of the ocean and particular seas, as well as their saline contents.
  He finds that the Southern Ocean is saltier than the Northern one, and that saltiness
  generally decreases near land and ice. Inland seas are usually less salty than the
  ocean, with the Mediterranean being an exception. The study also reveals that the
  density of water in different depths of the ocean remains consistent, and that salt
  separates from freezing sea-water.
