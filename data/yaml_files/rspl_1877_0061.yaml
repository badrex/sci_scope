revised_title: Investigation of the Increase in Resistance of Wires due to Stretching
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the increase in resistance to the
  passage of an electric current and stretching force in various wires. The study
  aims to determine the proportion of increased resistance due to length and section
  changes. The results show that the increase in resistance is directly proportional
  to the stretching force for all types of wires tested.
