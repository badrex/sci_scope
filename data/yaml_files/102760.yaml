scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the mechanics of the heart's motion and contraction, exploring
  the role of fluid matter, nerves, and muscle fibers in the heart's function. The
  author also investigates the alternate motion of the heart's auricles and ventricles,
  concluding that the heart's structure and function are closely related to those
  of other muscles in the body.
