revised_title: Temperature Coefficient of Iron and Cerebral Lesions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Properties
tldr: The author investigates the temperature coefficient of iron and discovers that
  it ranges from 0.0048 at ordinary temperatures to 0.018 at temperatures just short
  of 855Â°C. Additionally, the paper discusses descending degenerations in the central
  nervous system resulting from lesions of the cerebral cortex.
