revised_title: 'On the Induction of Electric Currents in Infinite Plates and Spherical
  Shells: A Study of Maxwell''s Theory'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the induction of electric currents in infinite plates
  and spherical shells, expanding on Maxwell's theory and providing a comprehensive
  analysis of the conditions required for current induction. The study includes a
  detailed examination of the vector potential, current, and electric distribution
  in various scenarios, such as thin and thick plates, and solid spheres or shells.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Maxwell's Equations
- Electric Currents
- Conductivity
