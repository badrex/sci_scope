revised_title: The Discovery of the Nervous System in Actinia
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author investigates the nervous system of Actinia, discovering that the
  bourses marginales, or chromatophores, are compound eyes and organs of sense. They
  are pyriform diverticula of the body-wall, containing layers of structure that resemble
  a retina, including lenses and nerve fibers. This finding advances the understanding
  of the nervous system in Coelenterata.
