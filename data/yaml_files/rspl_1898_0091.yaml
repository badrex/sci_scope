scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The authors analyze the densities of atmospheric nitrogen, pure nitrogen, and
  argon, and find that the calculated densities from various sets of data are in good
  agreement, confirming the density of atmospheric nitrogen and providing further
  evidence that argon is a pure substance.
