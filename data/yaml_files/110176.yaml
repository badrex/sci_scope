revised_title: Diurnal Changes of Magnetic Intensity in Dipping and Horizontal Needles
  at Treurenburgh Bay, Spitsbergen
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Captain Henry Foster conducted experiments using dipping and horizontal needles
  at Treurenburgh Bay in Spitsbergen to study diurnal changes in magnetic intensity.
  The results suggest that the primary cause of these changes is the sun, with the
  magnetic pole inflexing towards it during the day. The study also implies that changes
  in the general magnetic intensity of the Earth may be occurring.
