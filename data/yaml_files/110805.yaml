scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author argues that the primary function of the skin is to eliminate water
  from the body, and that interference with this process, such as through exposure
  to cold or moisture, can lead to illness and even death. He also explains the importance
  of skin secretion in maintaining the balance of fluids and nutrients in the body.
