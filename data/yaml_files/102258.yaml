scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author discusses a book that challenges the traditional belief of snail
  reproduction through eggs. The book presents evidence of snail eggs being white
  and small, similar to pepper grains. The author also refutes the arguments against
  this new theory, including those from Aristotle, and supports the idea of univocal
  generation in snail reproduction.
