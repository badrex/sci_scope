revised_title: On the Change of Refrangibility of Light and Internal Dispersion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the change of refrangibility and internal dispersion
  of light using solutions of sulphate of quinine and fluor-spar. The study reveals
  that the phenomenon of internal dispersion is not due to polarization but rather
  a change in refrangibility, supporting the undulatory theory of light.
