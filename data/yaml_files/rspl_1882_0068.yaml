revised_title: Infectivity of Blood and Fluids in Septic Disease and Virulence in
  Successive Inoculations
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Infectious Diseases & Pathology
tldr: The author investigates the infectivity of blood and other fluids in septic
  diseases and the alleged increase in virulence during successive inoculations. The
  study focuses on the blood of animals intoxicated with putrid matter and the transmission
  of symptoms to other animals. The author discusses previous research and experiments,
  questioning the widely accepted idea of an increase in infective virulence in successive
  inoculations.
