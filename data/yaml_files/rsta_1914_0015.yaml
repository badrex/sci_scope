revised_title: A Determination of the Electromotive Force of the Weston Normal Cell
  in Semi-absolute Volts
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors determine the electromotive force of the Weston normal cell using
  a modified Weber bifilar electrodynamometer, finding discrepancies in recent methods
  of absolute current determination. Their method offers a higher order of accuracy
  and provides a valuable comparison for other methods.
