scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Compounds & Reactions
tldr: C.F. Shoenbein, a professor of chemistry, presents evidence supporting his theory
  that ozone is a simple body and a constituent of nitrogen. He believes that nitrogen
  is a compound of hydrogen and ozone, and explains the release of ozone during various
  chemical processes, such as electric discharges in air, water electrolysis, and
  phosphorus reacting with atmospheric air.
