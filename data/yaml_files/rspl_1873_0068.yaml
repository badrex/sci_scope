revised_title: Molecular Structure of Vapours and Spectral Analysis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the molecular structure of various chemical elements'
  vapors and their densities using spectroscopic observations. The results show that
  the order of vapor densities in the sun's atmosphere does not agree with modern
  atomic weights, but more closely aligns with older atomic weights.
topics:
- Spectroscopy
- Molecular Structure
- Atomic Weights
- Vapor Densities
- Spectral Analysis of Elements
