tldr: The authors investigate the composition and formation of Egyptian blue, an artificial
  blue pigment used in ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire. They confirm that it is
  a crystalline silicate of copper and calcium, and establish that the presence of
  calcium carbonate is essential for its formation.
