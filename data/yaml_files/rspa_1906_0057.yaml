revised_title: The Foam-Structure of Matter and the Transition from the Liquid to
  the Solid State
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the foam-structure of various substances, including
  water, benzene, and salts, during the transition from the liquid to the solid state.
  The study reveals that solid bodies exhibit a foam-like structure, with phenomena
  similar to those observed in ice formation. The research also highlights the importance
  of surface tension and volume changes during the solidification process.
topics:
- Foa
- Solidification
