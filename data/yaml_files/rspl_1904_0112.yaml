revised_title: Physical Properties and Melting Point Determination of Sodium Borates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the physical properties of sodium borates, particularly
  focusing on the crystallization and glass formation of various mixtures of boric
  anhydride and sodium carbonate. They develop a new and rapid method for determining
  melting points, which they use to study the composition of the richest sodium borate
  obtainable by fusion.
