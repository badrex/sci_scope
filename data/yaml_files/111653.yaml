revised_title: 'Volatile Alkaloids and Putrefaction: A Study on the Chemical Composition
  of Noxious Products'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Toxicology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of noxious products given off
  during putrefaction. They discover that the volatile alkaloids contain carbon, hydrogen,
  nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, challenging the notion that these elements are
  released in simple forms like ammonia, and sulfur and phosphorus hydrogen compounds.
  The research also reveals that different volatile bodies are released during various
  stages of putrefaction.
