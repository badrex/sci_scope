revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Radiant Heating Effects from Terrestrial
  Sources
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, Baden Powell, conducts experiments to understand the nature of radiant
  heating effects from terrestrial sources. He discovers that heat radiated from luminous
  hot bodies is divided into two portions by a glass screen, one being stopped by
  the screen and the other passing through without raising its temperature. The author
  also finds that the non-transmissible portion of heat is absorbed more readily by
  blackened surfaces, while the transmissible portion is equally absorbed by black
  and white surfaces.
