revised_title: Geometrical Representation of Logical Class-Frequencies Consistency
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Logic & Statistics
tldr: The authors explore the theory of consistence of logical class-frequencies and
  its geometrical representation. They develop a general formula for any case and
  provide illustrations of the conditions using tetrahedra and congruence-surfaces.
  The paper also discusses the approximation towards the syllogism as conditions of
  the 'universal' type are approached.
