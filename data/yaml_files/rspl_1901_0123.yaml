revised_title: The Application of Kinetic Theory to the Electric, Magnetic, and Optical
  Properties of Diatomic Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author applies the kinetic theory of gases to the electric, magnetic, and
  optical properties of diatomic gases, focusing on the behavior of molecules with
  unequal mass and opposite electrical charges. The study examines the distribution
  of molecules in different classes, their magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constant,
  and optical effects, providing insights into the properties of gases and their potential
  applications.
