revised_title: Investigating the Phenomena of Thin Plates of Solid and Fluid Substances
  Exposed to Polarized Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author explores the optical phenomena of thin plates and films exposed to
  polarized light, specifically examining the modification of Newton's rings and the
  effects of varying angles of incidence. The study includes experiments with the
  Iriscope, a device that utilizes a plate of black glass to observe the deposition
  of colored rings of vapor.
