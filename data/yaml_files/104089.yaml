tldr: The case study examines the post-mortem examination of a woman who died from
  a large umbilical rupture. The woman had a history of abdominal pain and swelling,
  which was exacerbated by her diet and diarrhea. Upon autopsy, it was found that
  her small intestines, colon, and part of the stomach were contained in a sac, with
  the remaining organs in the abdomen. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing
  and treating abdominal hernias in the 18th century.
