scientific_subdiscipline: Mammalogy & Paleontology
tldr: The author describes the unique teeth of the extinct marsupial Sceparnodon,
  which have rootless, ever-growing scalpriform incisors. The teeth provide insight
  into the probable Marsupial fossil fauna of Australia and are compared to other
  marsupials and rodents. The author hopes to further study the extinct species through
  the analysis of more specimens and the reconstruction of its skeleton and dentition.
