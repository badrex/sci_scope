scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the thickness and constitution of the Earth's crust,
  considering factors such as precession, nutation, and the effects of temperature
  and pressure on solidification and fluidity. The study also explores the determination
  of isothermal surfaces within the Earth.
