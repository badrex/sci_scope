revised_title: Investigating the Weight of Hydrogen Desiccated by Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: Lord Rayleigh investigates the weight of hydrogen desiccated using liquid air
  instead of phosphoric anhydride. The results show that the weight is not significantly
  different, suggesting that phosphoric anhydride is an effective drying agent for
  hydrogen.
