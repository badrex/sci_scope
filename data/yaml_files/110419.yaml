tldr: Walter Adam's appendix to his previous paper on human osteology presents linear
  representations of various bone dimensions in both male and female humans. The author
  aims to facilitate comparison of the human frame with other animals and establish
  definite laws. He finds that many dimensions are multiples of the breadth of the
  cranium over the external ear passage, with seven or its multiples providing the
  most accurate measurements.
