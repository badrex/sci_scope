tldr: This study investigates the diphasic erosive action of salts on cholate gels,
  revealing that gel stability is determined by the action of multiple factors. The
  results indicate that the presence of various salts affects the erosion of the gel,
  with lithium chloride showing the strongest effect, followed by sodium, magnesium,
  and potassium chlorides. The findings suggest that understanding the interactions
  between salts and gels could help explain the biological actions of salts in living
  cells.
