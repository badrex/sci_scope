scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the infectivity of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina
  palpalis and find that the trypanosomes can retain their virulence for up to two
  days after being ingested by the tsetse fly. They also discover that the period
  of infectivity coincides with the time when the infected fly is unable to transmit
  sleeping sickness through biting.
