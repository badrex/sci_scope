revised_title: A Thermal Telephone Transmitter Using a Platinum Wire
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Telecommunications & Electronics
tldr: The author, Prof. George Forbes, demonstrates a thermal telephone transmitter
  that uses a wooden cylinder with a platinum wire stretched across a slit. When the
  wire is heated, it cools and changes electrical resistance, allowing for the transmission
  of speech through a telephone. The experiment shows promise but is not likely to
  lead to practical applications.
