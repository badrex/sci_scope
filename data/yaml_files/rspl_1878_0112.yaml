revised_title: The Chemical Composition and Solubility of Aleurone Grains in Leguminous
  Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: 'The author investigates the chemical composition of aleurone grains in leguminous
  plants, specifically the blue lupin, and discovers that they consist of two types
  of proteins: hemialbumose, soluble in water, and globulins, soluble in 10% NaCl
  solution. The study provides insights into the process of germination and the extraction
  of proteins from seeds.'
