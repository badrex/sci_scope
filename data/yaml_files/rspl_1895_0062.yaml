revised_title: Investigating the Origin of Lines and Bands in the Spectra from Swedish
  Bessemer Works

scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines the origin of lines and bands observed in the spectra from
  Swedish Bessemer works, suggesting that silicon hydride may be the cause of certain
  bands rather than phosphorus. The study also discusses the importance of accurately
  determining the width of the instrument's slit for consistent observations.
