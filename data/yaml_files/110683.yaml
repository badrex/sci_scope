revised_title: Chemical Constitution of Resins and Their Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Polymer Science
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition and molecular structure of
  various resins, analyzing their formulas and the effects of heat on their decomposition.
  He concludes that resins are not a single compound but rather a group of analogous
  compounds with similar radicals, and that heat causes partial decomposition and
  changes in atomic constitution.
