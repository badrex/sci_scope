revised_title: Observations of Southern Nebulae Spectra
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: John Herschel examines the spectra of various southern nebulae using a telescope
  and spectroscope. He observes distinct lines in some spectra, while others show
  only continuous streaks or no visible lines. He also studies the spectrum of lightning
  and notes numerous bright lines, including the blue nitrogen line and a suspicion
  of the red hydrogen line.
