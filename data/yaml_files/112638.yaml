revised_title: Investigating the Heating Effect of Rapid Rotation in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors, Balfour Stewart and P. G. Tait, investigate the heating effect
  of a rotating disk in a vacuum and conclude that it is not due to rotation under
  the Earth's magnetic force or heat conducted from the bearings. They also explore
  the possibility of other causes, such as friction, and discuss the role of the ebonite
  washer in protecting the aluminum disk from heat.
