scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author, William Hirst, describes his observation of a fire-ball in Hornsey
  on February 26, 1753. The fire-ball moved quickly across the sky, had a distinct
  shape with a nucleus and tail, and was not accompanied by any noise or explosion.
  Hirst compares his observation to another reported in the Gentleman's Magazine,
  suggesting that the fire-ball's height in the atmosphere must be considerable.
