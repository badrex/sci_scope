scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author conducts magnetic experiments using an iron bar and demonstrates
  that when struck, the bar can transfer its magnetic properties. The upper end of
  the bar attracts the north end of a compass needle, while the lower end attracts
  the south end. This phenomenon occurs regardless of the direction of the blow, as
  long as the bar is in a vertical position when receiving the impact.
