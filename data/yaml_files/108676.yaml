revised_title: Influence of the Nervous System on Arterial Contractions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the role of the nervous system, specifically the sympathetic
  nerve and spinal cord, in regulating arterial contractions in frogs. The experiments
  show that while these systems do influence arterial contractions, the effects are
  not permanent and can be replaced by other nerve functions.
