scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: William Herschel investigates the nature of the sun to understand the causes
  and symptoms of its variable emission of light and heat. He proposes a new nomenclature
  for solar phenomena and suggests that the sun's atmosphere contains luminous clouds
  that affect its emission of light and heat, which can be used to predict seasons.
