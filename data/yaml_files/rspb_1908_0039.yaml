revised_title: Investigating the Secretion of Hydrochloric Acid in Gastric Contents
  of Mice and Rats in Cancer
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cancer Biology & Oncology
tldr: This study examines the variations in hydrochloric acid secretion in the gastric
  contents of mice and rats compared to humans, specifically in cancer cases. The
  researchers found an increase in hydrochloric acid in mice with transplanted tumors,
  contrary to the expected decrease. This suggests that the absence or reduction of
  hydrochloric acid in human cancer patients may not be applicable to mice models.
