scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author extends Professor Casey's work on the fourfold generation of bicircular
  quartic curves and inscribed quadrilaterals. By considering infinitesimal variations
  of these quadrilaterals, the author establishes monomial equations for the arcs
  and the relations between the parameters. The paper further develops the theory
  of transformation to elliptic integrals.
