revised_title: 'The Physiological Cost of Muscular Work: Measuring Energy Output of
  Dock Labourers'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Biomechanics
tldr: This study investigates the energy output of dock labourers during heavy work
  by measuring their carbon dioxide discharge. The research compares two methods for
  determining energy output and discusses the physiological cost of muscular work,
  including the rapid establishment of a constant regime during physical exertion.
topics:
- Muscular Work
- Energy Output
- Carbon Dioxide Discharge
- Physiology of Exercise
- Laborers' Workload
