revised_title: A Study of Space Coverage and Interstices in Arrangements of Equal
  Circles
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the arrangement of equal circles on a plane surface
  and calculates the proportion of space covered by the circles to the space occupied
  by their interstices. The study involves determining the ultimate proportion when
  the circles are infinitely small and the space they are disposed upon is of finite
  magnitude.
