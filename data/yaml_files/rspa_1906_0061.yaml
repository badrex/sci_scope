revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Electric Fields on Spectral Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of electric fields on spectral lines using
  various experimental setups. They find that the passage of Rontgen rays and changes
  in the electric field do not significantly alter the wavelengths of spectral lines.
  The study also reveals that the Doppler effect is present in canal rays, and the
  Zeeman effect is masked by line broadening under certain conditions.
