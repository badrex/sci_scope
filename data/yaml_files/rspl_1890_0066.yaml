revised_title: Reevaluation of the Generic Identity of Sceparnodon and Phascolonus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines fossil specimens from the Pleistocene deposits of Australia
  and concludes that the genera Sceparnodon and Phascolonus are not distinct, as previously
  believed. The specimens show that both genera share similar upper incisors, supporting
  their generic identity.
