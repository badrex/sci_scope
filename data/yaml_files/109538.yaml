revised_title: New Galvanic Combinations and Apparatus
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Batteries
tldr: Humphry Davy investigates new galvanic combinations using single metallic plates
  and fluids, similar to Mr. Volta's galvanic apparatus. He demonstrates that these
  combinations can produce a galvanic battery, with the wire from the oxidizing surface
  evolving hydrogen and the non-oxidizing surface depositing oxide. The experiments
  show that these effects are more noticeable when using metallic substances oxidizable
  in acids and capable of acting on solutions of sulfurets.
