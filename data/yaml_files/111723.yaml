  with Triangular Numbers
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theorem that proves every odd number can
  be composed of four squares, with the algebraic sum of their roots equal to 1. Additionally,
  the author demonstrates that if an odd number can be divided into four squares,
  then it can also be composed of not more than three triangular numbers.
