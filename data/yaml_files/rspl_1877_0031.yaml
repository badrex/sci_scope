revised_title: Further Observations on the Modification of Motor Nerve Excitability
  after Injury
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of nerve injury on the excitability of motor
  nerves using a modified method of varying the intensity of the voltaic current.
  The results show that after injury, the excitability of motor nerves increases,
  with the anodic make and kathodic break being more sensitive to stimulation.
