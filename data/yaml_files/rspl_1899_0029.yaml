revised_title: 'Discovery of Victorium: A New Element Associated with Yttrium'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: Sir William Crookes investigates phosphorescent spectra and discovers a new
  element, Victorium, associated with Yttrium through a complex process of chemical
  fractionation. The research involves multiple methods of separation and spectroscopic
  analysis to isolate and study the properties of this new element.
