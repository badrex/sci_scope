revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Fog on Sound Signals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates the effectiveness of sound signals in foggy conditions
  and challenges the prevailing belief that fog significantly obstructs sound propagation.
  The study reveals that fog does not have a uniform impact on sound and that other
  factors, such as air currents and temperature, play a more significant role in the
  attenuation of sound.
