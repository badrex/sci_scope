revised_title: The Influence of Mirror Flexure on Resolving Power in Reflecting Telescopes
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering & Design
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of mirror flexure on the resolving power
  of reflecting telescopes due to the weight of the mirror and its support methods.
  They calculate the distortion caused by the weight for various support types and
  analyze the effect on the resolving power, determining whether there is a critical
  aperture size for practical applications.
