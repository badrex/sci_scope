tldr: Captain Clarke revisits Archdeacon Pratt's paper on the effect of local attraction
  on the English arc, using updated data and calculations from the Trigonometrical
  Survey. The results show that errors in the original data led to incorrect calculations,
  and the paper provides corrected values for the ellipticity and local attraction
  at the stations.
