revised_title: Ionization of Various Gases by the Beta-Rays of Actinium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The author investigates the ionization of various gases by the beta-rays of
  actinium and compares the results with those of uranium rays. The study reveals
  that the ionization in gases is primarily a measure of the number of S-rays produced,
  which are rays with insufficient velocity to create further ions. The results provide
  further insight into the nature of ionization in gases by beta-rays.
