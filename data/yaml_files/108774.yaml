revised_title: On the Reconciliation of Brinkley's and Herschel's Formulae for the
  General Term in the Development of Lagrange's Expression for the Summation of Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between Dr. Brinkley's and Sir J.F.W.
  Herschel's formulae for the general term in the development of Lagrange's expression
  for the summation of series. By analyzing the formulae and their applications, the
  author demonstrates their reconcilability and provides a new method for expanding
  series of functions.
