revised_title: The Antagonistic Action of Calcium on the Inhibitory Effect of Magnesium
  in Animal Physiology
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pharmacology
tldr: The authors demonstrate that calcium neutralizes the inhibitory effects of magnesium
  in animal physiology, suggesting that their actions within the body are antagonistic
  rather than similar in character.
