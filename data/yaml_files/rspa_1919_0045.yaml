revised_title: Determination of the Rydberg Constant for Spectral Series
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors analyze the wavelengths of the first six lines of the Balmer series
  of hydrogen and determine the corrected value of the Rydberg constant for spectral
  series, taking into account the composite structure of the lines and recent accurate
  determinations of the refractive index of air.
