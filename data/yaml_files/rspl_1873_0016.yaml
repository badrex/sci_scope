revised_title: Investigation of Sound Transmission in the Atmosphere and Fog-Signals
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Acoustics
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the transmission of sound through the atmosphere and
  tests various fog signals, including horns, whistles, and guns. He discovers that
  the effectiveness of these signals varies greatly depending on atmospheric conditions
  and that the acoustic transparency of the air can change rapidly. Tyndall also observes
  that audible echoes can be reflected from an optically transparent atmosphere.
