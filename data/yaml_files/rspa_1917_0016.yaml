revised_title: The Initial Wave Resistance of a Moving Surface Pressure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the initial wave resistance of a moving surface pressure,
  focusing on the effects of sudden establishment and initial acceleration. The study
  provides a general expression for wave resistance and explores various methods for
  calculating wave resistance in non-steady states.
