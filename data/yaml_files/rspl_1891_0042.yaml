revised_title: Audibility of Single Sound Waves and the Number of Vibrations Necessary
  to Produce a Tone
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The authors investigate the audibility of single sound waves and find that they
  can be heard separately up to a rate of about forty vibrations per second. They
  also discover that the fusion of vibrations into a musical tone is distinct from
  the audibility of individual vibrations.
