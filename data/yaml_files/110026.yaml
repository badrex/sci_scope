revised_title: Discovery and Properties of Metallic Titanium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: Wollaston discovers metallic titanium in small cubic crystals found in iron
  furnace slag. He describes its hardness, resistance to acids, and its ability to
  conduct electricity. Titanium's extreme infusibility leads Wollaston to propose
  a new mode of formation for metallic crystals.
