revised_title: Investigation of Light Scattering and Absorption in Gaseous Media
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the scattering and absorption of light in gaseous media,
  with applications to the intensity of sky radiation. They introduce a second term
  in the differential equation for loss of intensity in a beam of radiation, accounting
  for attenuation by absorption without scattering. They also consider the effect
  of self-illumination on the intensity of sky radiation and apply their findings
  to problems of solar radiation attenuation and sky radiation intensity.
