revised_title: The Role of Modified Plant Pigments in Lepidopterous Larvae Coloration
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: The author investigates the role of modified plant pigments in the coloration
  of certain Lepidopterous larvae. By feeding larvae with different types of plant
  parts, the author demonstrates that the larvae's colors are largely due to modified
  chlorophyll derived from their food, supporting the theory that these pigments play
  a significant role in their coloration.
