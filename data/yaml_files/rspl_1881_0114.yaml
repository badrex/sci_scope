revised_title: 'Impact Phenomena on Liquid Surfaces: Solid and Liquid Spheres'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Rheology
tldr: The authors study the impact of solid and liquid spheres on liquid surfaces,
  using improved apparatus and techniques. They observe and describe the resulting
  splashes and disturbances, providing insights into the role of surface properties,
  velocity, and liquid mobility in the phenomena.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Splash Phenomena
- Surface Tension
- Impact Mechanics
- Drop Impact
