scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the structure and function of various muscles in the upper
  extremity, specifically the pectoralis major, coraco-brachialis, deltoid, teres
  major, and latissimus dorsi. They explore the mechanical advantages and disadvantages
  of each muscle's position and action, and propose the use of a Daniell battery for
  measuring muscle strength.
