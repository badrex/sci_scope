scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic & Organometallic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reaction between dibromide of ethylene and triethylphosphine,
  leading to the formation of diphosphonium compounds. These compounds are stable
  and have unique properties, such as being unaffected by high temperatures and forming
  a powerful alkaline liquid when dissolved in water.
