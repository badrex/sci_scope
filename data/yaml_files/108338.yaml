revised_title: Microscopic Observations on Vesicular Vapours of Water
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the structure of water vapor using microscopy and challenges
  the widely accepted theory of vesicular vapors. Through experiments and observations,
  the author concludes that the vesicular structure of water vapor particles is erroneous
  and suggests alternative explanations for the observed phenomena.
