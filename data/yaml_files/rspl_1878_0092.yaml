  of Arctic Sea-Water and Ice
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Glaciology
tldr: The author investigates the specific gravity, temperature, and composition of
  Arctic sea-water and ice during an expedition. They find that the water has a low
  specific gravity and temperature, and the ice has a disturbed proportion of chlorides
  and sulfates. The author also examines the structure of the ice, noting its horizontal
  stratification and the varying salinity levels within it.
