revised_title: Observations on the Height of the Barometer and the Effect of Altitude
  on Atmospheric Refraction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Dr. Nettleton investigates the relationship between the height of the barometer
  and elevation above sea level. He finds that atmospheric refraction affects the
  accuracy of observations made at high altitudes, and provides a method to correct
  for this error.
