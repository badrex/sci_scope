  Muscle of the Frog'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the gastrocnemius muscle
  of the frog, challenging Du Bois-Reymond's law of muscle-current and revealing inconsistencies
  in the electrical properties of muscle-cylinders. The study shows that the contracting
  parts of the muscle become positive, and the electrical state during contraction
  is different from that at rest.
