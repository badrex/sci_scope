  Sources'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: Charles Hatchett discovers that tannin, a substance found in plants, can be
  artificially produced from vegetable, mineral, and animal coals through chemical
  reactions with nitric acid. This finding expands the understanding of tannin's sources
  and properties, as it can be created from various materials and has significant
  chemical effects.
