revised_title: Magnetization of Iron and its Effects on Metal Rods
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments on various types of iron and
  steel, including cast iron, malleable cast iron, wrought iron, and other steels.
  The electrical resistance and magnetic properties are measured, with a focus on
  the high resistance of cast iron and the non-magnetic properties of manganese steel.
  Practical applications of these findings are discussed, as well as the effects of
  magnetization on the length of iron, steel, and nickel rods.
topics:
- Magnetization
- Iron
- Magnetic Properties
- Manganese Steel
- Electrical Resistance
