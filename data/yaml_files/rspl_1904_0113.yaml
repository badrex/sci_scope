revised_title: Investigating the Group IV Lines of Silicium and Their Relation to
  Stellar Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Elemental Analysis
tldr: The authors examine the Group IV lines of silicium and their presence in stellar
  spectra. They find that these lines are consistently present in silicium-based spectra
  and match the wavelengths of strong lines in the spectra of belt stars of Orion
  and other celestial bodies. The authors argue that the Group IV lines are genuine
  silicium lines, despite challenges to their authenticity.
