revised_title: 'Thermo-Electric Currents of Ritterian Species: A Study on Electromotive
  Force and Metal Tensions'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author, C.K. Akin, investigates the electromotive force of thermo-electric
  couples and the role of metal tensions in their function. He demonstrates that the
  electromotive force can be expressed as the difference between two quantities, dependent
  on the temperature and the nature of the circuit. Akin also explores the influence
  of the texture and chemical nature of substances on thermo-electric function and
  discusses the possibility of thermo-electric inversions.
