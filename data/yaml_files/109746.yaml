revised_title: Further Investigations on the Muriatic and Oxymuriatic Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Dr. William Henry conducts additional experiments on muriatic and oxymuriatic
  acids, focusing on their electrization and the evolution of hydrogen. He finds that
  the presence of mercury affects the outcome of the experiments, as it removes oxymuriatic
  acid and allows for more hydrogen evolution. Henry also discusses the two prevailing
  theories on the reaction between muriatic acid, oxygen, and hydrogen, and suggests
  further research on the proportions of gases involved.
