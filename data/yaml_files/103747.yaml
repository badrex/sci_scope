revised_title: The Effect of Body Position on Human Stature
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the change in human stature due to body position and
  weight distribution. He explains that the spine's cartilage compresses under the
  weight of the upper body, causing a decrease in height when standing and an increase
  in height when lying down. This phenomenon is more significant in younger individuals,
  as cartilage becomes less elastic with age.
