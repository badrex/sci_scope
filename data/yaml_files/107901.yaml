scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Instrumentation
tldr: The author examines the accuracy of Captain Kater's pendulum method, considering
  various factors that can affect the measurement of a simple pendulum's length. The
  study provides a comprehensive analysis of the errors that can arise from deviations
  in the knife edges and offers suggestions for improving the method's precision.
