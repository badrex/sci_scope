revised_title: Correcting Correlation Coefficients between Pressure and Temperature
  in the Free Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between pressure and temperature at
  the same level in the free atmosphere, using statistical methods to correct correlation
  coefficients and account for errors in observations. The study provides insights
  into understanding atmospheric conditions and weather patterns.
