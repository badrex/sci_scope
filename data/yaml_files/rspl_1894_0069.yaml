revised_title: 'Researches on Modern Explosives: Preliminary Communication'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the properties and chemical reactions of modern explosives,
  particularly smokeless gunpowders, focusing on nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin.
  They discuss the development of these explosives, their composition, and their potential
  applications in firearms. The authors also describe their experimental methods and
  findings, including the heat generated by explosions, the volume and composition
  of gases produced, and the pressure exerted by these explosives.
topics:
- Explosives
- Smokeless Gunpowder
- Nitrocellulose
