revised_title: Investigating the Phenomena of Photo-Chemical Induction
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study examines the phenomena of photo-chemical induction, specifically
  the interaction between light and chemical reactions. The authors investigate the
  effects of light on the reaction between chlorine and hydrogen, discovering that
  the duration of the reaction is influenced by the volume of exposed gas and the
  intensity of the light source. They also explore the role of foreign gases in altering
  the reaction and propose that the resistance to chemical combination can be overcome
  by photo-chemical induction.
