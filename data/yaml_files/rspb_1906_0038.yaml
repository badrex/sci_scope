revised_title: The Role of Ovaries and Uterus in Mammary Gland Growth and Activity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Endocrinology
tldr: The authors investigate the factors that determine the growth and activity of
  mammary glands, concluding that the ovaries and uterus play a significant role in
  their development. They argue that the connection between these organs and the mammary
  glands is chemical rather than nervous, and that the secretion of milk is triggered
  by the removal of certain stimuli from the pregnant animal, rather than the absorption
  of substances from the ovaries or involuting uterus.
