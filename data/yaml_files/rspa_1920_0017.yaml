revised_title: A New Method for the Direct Determination of Stress in Plane Strain
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials
tldr: The authors propose a new method for the direct determination of stress in plane
  strain, using plane harmonic functions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. This
  method allows for the synthesis of stress solutions and provides a more efficient
  approach to solving stress equations in various coordinate systems.
