revised_title: The Role of Inorganic Catalysts in Photosynthesis and Light-Induced
  Organic Synthesis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the role of inorganic catalysts, such as iron and uranium
  compounds, in photosynthesis and light-induced organic synthesis. They find that
  these catalysts absorb sunlight energy and transform it into chemical energy, which
  is then used to produce formaldehyde from water and carbon dioxide. This process
  demonstrates the importance of inorganic catalysts in photosynthesis and the potential
  for light-induced organic synthesis.
