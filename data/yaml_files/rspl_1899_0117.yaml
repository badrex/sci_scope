revised_title: Investigating Electromotive Phenomena in Non-medullated Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author examines the electromotive phenomena of non-medullated nerve, specifically
  the olfactory nerve of the pike, and compares the resting current with that of medullated
  nerves. The results show a higher electromotive force for non-medullated nerves,
  and the author discusses the response of the nerves to various stimuli.
