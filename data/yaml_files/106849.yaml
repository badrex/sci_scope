revised_title: Investigating Spherical Motion and the Properties of Natural Axes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Mechanics
tldr: The author, Charles Wildbore, investigates the motion of a sphere and the properties
  of natural axes in relation to the work of other mathematicians, such as D'Alembert
  and Euler. He explores the velocity of points on the surface of a revolving sphere
  and the effects of different motions on the sphere's natural axis.
