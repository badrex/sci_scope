tldr: This article presents a case study of a woman who, despite not having a womb,
  carried a fetus outside her body in a bag-like structure. The fetus was found to
  be in a bended posture with its head projecting forward, forming a prominence near
  the navel. The case study provides insights into the development and positioning
  of the fetus, as well as the anatomy and pathology involved.
