revised_title: The Synthesis of Calcium Silicalcyanide and a New Felspar
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author synthesizes a stable compound, Calcium Silicalcyanide, and a new
  felspar, Anorthite, through the reduction of silica and alumino-silicates using
  metallic magnesium. This supports the idea that aluminum may play a role in silicides
  similar to nitrogen in organic compounds.
