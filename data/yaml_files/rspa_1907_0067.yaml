revised_title: 'The Annealing Process of Copper: A Study on Dilatation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the annealing process of copper and its dilatation.
  The authors develop an extensometer to measure the changes in length of copper bars
  at various temperatures. They find that copper expands during the annealing process,
  and the expansion is related to the temperature and the transformation of the metal
  from a hard to a soft state.
