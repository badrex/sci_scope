revised_title: 'Experiments on the Tourmalin: Determining the Nature of Electricities'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the Tourmalin, or Ashstone, and concludes
  that glass is permeable by electricity, challenging Dr. Franklin's theory that glass
  has a constant quantity of electrical fire. The experiments also help determine
  which of the electricities is truly plus and which is minus.
