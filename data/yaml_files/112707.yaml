revised_title: The Critical Point and Continuity of Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the critical point of carbonic acid and its transition
  from a gaseous to liquid state under varying temperatures and pressures. The findings
  suggest that the gaseous and liquid states are part of a continuous spectrum of
  matter, with the critical point marking a transition between the two states.
