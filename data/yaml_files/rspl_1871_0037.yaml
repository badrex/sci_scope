revised_title: Investigating the Directive Power of Large Steel Magnets, Magnetized
  Soft Iron Bars, and Galvanic Coils
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to study the directive power of large steel
  magnets, magnetized soft iron bars, and galvanic coils. They observe the force exerted
  by these magnetic objects and compare their effects on a small compass. The results
  show that the core of a galvanic coil has a much greater force than the coil alone,
  and the law of force at different parts of the coil differs from that of a magnet
  or core.
