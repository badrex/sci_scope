scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Applied Mathematics
tldr: This article explores the ellipsotomic problem and the third elliptic integral,
  providing a solution to the division and transformation of elliptic functions. It
  also discusses various applications of the third elliptic integral in dynamical
  problems, such as Poinsot's herpolhode, the spinning top, the spherical catenary,
  the velarium, and the elastica under uniform normal pressure.
