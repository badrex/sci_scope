revised_title: An Investigation into the Peripheral Distribution of Fibres in the
  Posterior Roots of Spinal Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study examines the peripheral distribution of fibers in the posterior roots
  of spinal nerves, focusing on the cranial and cervico-brachial nerve roots. The
  author investigates the skin and motor distribution of these nerves, as well as
  the segmental scheme of innervation in the limbs. The research also explores spinal
  reflex action and its implications for understanding the nervous system.
