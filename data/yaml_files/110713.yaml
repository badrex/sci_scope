revised_title: Theoretical Explanation of a New Polarity in Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: George B. Airy investigates the apparent new polarity in light and explains
  the phenomena using the undulatory theory of light. He also addresses the case when
  the spectrum is viewed in focus, reconciling seemingly conflicting statements and
  clearing the obscurity surrounding the subject.
