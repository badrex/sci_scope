  Methide'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic & Organometallic Chemistry
tldr: The author, Edward Frankland, investigates new series of compounds containing
  boron, specifically boric ethide and boric methide. He describes their formation,
  properties, and reactions with various substances, including ammonia, acids, and
  alkalis. These compounds represent a significant contribution to the understanding
  of organometallic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.
