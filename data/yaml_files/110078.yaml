revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of α Lyrae
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Astrometry
tldr: Dr. Brinkley examines the parallax of α Lyrae using observations from the Dublin
  and Greenwich observatories. He finds inconsistencies in the data, suggesting that
  the instruments may not have been accurate enough to determine the parallax with
  certainty.
