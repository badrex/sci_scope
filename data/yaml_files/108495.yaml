scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author investigates a class of differential equations and demonstrates that
  they can be used to solve dynamical problems, including those involving partial
  differential coefficients and the concept of a 'principal function.' The study has
  implications for the fields of mathematical physics and Hamiltonian mechanics.
