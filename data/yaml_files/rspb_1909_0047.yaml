revised_title: 'The Elasticity of Rubber Balloons and Hollow Viscera: An Investigation
  into the Behavior of Rubber and Its Implications for Biological Structures'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biomechanics & Biophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the elasticity of rubber balloons and hollow viscera,
  discovering that the pressure inside a balloon rises quickly to a maximum and then
  falls slowly during inflation. They propose that a 'disturbing factor' called initial
  rigidity may explain this behavior, and discuss its implications for biological
  structures.
