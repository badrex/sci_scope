scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive indices of elements, focusing on mercury,
  phosphorus, and sulfur. They find that the refractivities of these elements conform
  to the rule that in each chemical group, the refractivities of elements are in the
  ratios of small integers. The authors also observe a relationship between refractivity
  and valency, with the power to retard light increasing as valency increases.
