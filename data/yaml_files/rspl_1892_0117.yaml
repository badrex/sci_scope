revised_title: On the Coagulation of Peptone Plasma
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the coagulation of peptone plasma and suggests that
  it may be due to a precipitation of cell-fibrinogen under the influence of an excess
  of weak acid, similar to the process that occurs when peptone is injected into the
  blood.
