revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Absorption in Metallic and Metalloidal Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the absorption of thick metallic and metalloidal vapours
  and finds that increasing thickness does not necessarily cause a continuous spectrum.
  Instead, the spectrum approaches the continuous state by either widening lines or
  adding more lines. The author also demonstrates this through experiments using hydrogen
  and iodine vapours.
