revised_title: The Detection of Gaseous Products from Radioactive Bodies Using the
  Radiometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: Sir James Dewar investigates the use of the radiometer in detecting small gas
  pressures and gaseous products produced by radioactive bodies. He demonstrates that
  the radiometer can be used as an efficient instrument for research in this area,
  with potential applications in detecting monadic gases and studying radioactivity.
