revised_title: Investigation of Wave-Length Variations in Oscillations Generated by
  Three-Electrode Thermionic Tubes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors study the effects of altering variables in oscillating circuits
  with three-electrode thermionic tubes, focusing on the changes in wave-length and
  the conditions required for producing continuous waves of constant frequency.
topics:
- Thermionic tubes
- Oscillatory circuits
- Wav
- Electron tubes
- Frequency control
