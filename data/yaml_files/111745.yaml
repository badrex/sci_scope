scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the attraction of ellipsoids, demonstrating that the
  attraction on a point on the surface or within the ellipsoid is proportional to
  the distance from its principal planes. The paper also explores the preservation
  of ellipsoid form under certain conditions and provides a theorem on the attraction
  of concentric spheres.
