  in Plants'

scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The Stomatograph is a self-recording device invented by W. Lawrence Balls and
  Francis Darwin to measure the mean stomatal aperture of a given leaf by recording
  the velocity of air passing through the tissues under constant pressure. The device
  was specifically designed for field research on stomatal movement in the cotton
  plant in Egypt, with the aim of understanding the plant's relationship to water
  and soil conditions.
