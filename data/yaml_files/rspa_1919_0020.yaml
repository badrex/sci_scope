revised_title: Temperature Variations in the Elasticity of Metals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the elasticity of various
  metals, finding that more infusible metals are less affected by temperature. The
  study suggests a possible relationship between a metal's melting point and the rate
  at which its rigidity changes with temperature.
