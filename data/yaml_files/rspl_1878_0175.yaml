scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of a stable reducing substance in the blood,
  besides sugar, which remains unaffected by advanced putrefaction. This substance
  amounts to 0.200 to 0.300 per 1,000 and suggests that previous figures representing
  sugar levels in the blood should be adjusted accordingly.
