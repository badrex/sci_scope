revised_title: A New Optical Experiment to Create Apparitions and Representations
  on Walls
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author describes a new optical experiment that creates vivid and distinct
  representations of objects, pictures, and even landscapes on walls using sunlight
  or artificial light. The experiment involves using a hole or window, a convex glass,
  and reflecting and refracting glasses to project the image onto the desired surface.
  This technique can be used to create various effects, such as magnification or the
  appearance of moving objects, and can be performed during the day or at night with
  the help of torches or lamps.
