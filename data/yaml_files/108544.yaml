revised_title: Investigating Electric States in Living Animals During Secretion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if any signs of electric current
  are present during the secretion process in living animals. Using a galvanometer,
  the author finds evidence of electric states between bile and blood, suggesting
  that these effects may be due to decomposition, catalytic actions, or thermo-electric
  actions.
