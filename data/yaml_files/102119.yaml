revised_title: Experiments on the Efficacy of Larger Coach Wheels
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Transportation & Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author conducts experiments to demonstrate that larger coach wheels are
  easier to draw over obstacles due to reduced friction and improved weight distribution.
  The findings suggest that high-wheeled wagons could be more efficient in various
  terrains and conditions.
