revised_title: On the Application of the Principle of Reciprocity to Acoustics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates the principle of reciprocity in acoustics, demonstrating
  how sound propagation and transmission can be affected by factors such as wind and
  temperature. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the behavior
  of sound sources and their interactions with obstacles.
