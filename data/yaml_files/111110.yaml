  Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the diffusion of various liquids and
  their relation to isomorphous substances. He examines the diffusion rates of different
  concentrations of acids and salts, and discusses the compatibility of diverse physical
  properties with equal diffusibility in isomorphous substances.
