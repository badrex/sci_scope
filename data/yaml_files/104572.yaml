scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Monsieur Buffon shares his re-invention of Archimedes' burning specula and its
  ability to burn wood at 200 feet, melt tin and lead at 120 feet, and silver at 50
  feet. He discusses the theory behind his discovery, which is based on the idea that
  heat is not proportional to the quantity of light and that rays do not come parallel
  from the sun.
