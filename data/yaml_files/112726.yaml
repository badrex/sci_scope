revised_title: The Action of Bromine on Ethylbenzol and the Influence of Iodine on
  Substitution
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author investigates the action of bromine on ethylbenzol and discovers that
  the position of the substituting bromine atom depends on the presence of iodine.
  When iodine is present, substitution occurs in the phenyl group, while in its absence,
  it occurs in the lateral group. This finding has implications for the synthesis
  of various organic compounds.
