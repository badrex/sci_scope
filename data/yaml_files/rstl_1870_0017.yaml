revised_title: Investigating the Relation between Sun's Altitude and Chemical Intensity
  of Total Daylight in a Cloudless Sky
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The authors conducted a series of measurements on the west coast of Portugal
  to determine the relationship between the sun's altitude and the chemical intensity
  of total daylight in a cloudless sky. They used sensitive paper to estimate the
  tint that the paper assumed when exposed to daylight and found that the relation
  between altitude and chemical intensity is accurately represented by a straight
  line.
topics:
- Sun's Altitude
- Chemical Intensity
