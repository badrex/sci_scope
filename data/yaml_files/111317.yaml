revised_title: Geometrical Isomorphism of Crystals
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: The author, Henry James Brooke, explores the geometrical isomorphism of crystals
  and presents new tables that reveal unexpected facts about crystallography. He discusses
  the six crystal systems, their elementary angles, and the nature of high indices.
  Brooke suggests that a geometrical isomorphism exists throughout each crystal system
  and that the oblique and anorthic systems may be varieties of prismatic crystals.
