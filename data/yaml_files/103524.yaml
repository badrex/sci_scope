scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author and other observers, including Sir Tho. Dereham, study the Ignis
  Fatuus, a mysterious glowing meteor, and find that it is not caused by insects or
  fireflies. They describe its appearance, behavior, and various locations where it
  can be observed, and discuss its properties and similarities to phosphorus. The
  Ignis Fatuus is found to be more common in wet and cold weather and does not cause
  fires or burn combustible substances.
