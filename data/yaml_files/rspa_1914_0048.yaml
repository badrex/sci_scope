revised_title: Improved Electromotive Force Determination of the Weston Normal Cell
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: This paper presents a determination of the electromotive force of the Weston
  Normal Cell using a modified form of the bifilar Weber electro-dynamometer. The
  author claims that the absolute accuracy of the value has been significantly increased,
  overcoming previous obstacles in using this type of dynamometer. The final value
  for the electromotive force of the international mean Weston normal cell is found
  to be 1.01831 semi-absolute volts at 20Â°C.
