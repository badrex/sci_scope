revised_title: Investigating the Capacity for Heat of Metals at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the heat capacity of various metals at low temperatures
  using a new method that maintains an enclosure at desired temperatures. They compare
  their findings with previous research and discuss the applicability of different
  heat capacity formulas, concluding that Debye's formula provides the closest approximation
  to experimental results.
