revised_title: Specific Gravity of Sea-Water in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Chemistry
tldr: The author, Philip P. King, conducted experiments to determine the specific
  gravity of sea-water in various locations during a voyage. He found that the density
  of ocean water is nearly identical in the Atlantic between 40° North and 40° South
  latitude, with exceptions due to local factors. The specific gravity of the South
  Pacific water between 10° and 40° is 1026.48, and between 40° and 60° it is 1026.13.
