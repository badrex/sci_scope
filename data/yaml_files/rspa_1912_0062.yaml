revised_title: Investigation of the Absorption and Reflection of β-Particles by Sheets
  of Matter of Different Thicknesses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Particle Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: 'The authors investigate the absorption and reflection of β-particles by sheets
  of matter of varying thicknesses, discovering that rays reflected by thin layers
  are more easily absorbed than those reflected by thicker ones. The results suggest
  that the reflected radiation can be roughly divided into two parts: an easily absorbed
  radiation and a more penetrating one.'
