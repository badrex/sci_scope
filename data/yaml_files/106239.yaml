revised_title: Optimal Composition and Process for Reflecting Telescope Speculums
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author describes a new composition for reflecting telescope speculums, using
  a mixture of Swedish copper and grain-tin, and outlines a process to prevent pores
  and maintain hardness and whiteness. The method involves melting the copper and
  tin together, casting the metal into an ingot, and then melting it again before
  pouring into molds. This composition and process improve the reflective powers and
  durability of the speculum.
