revised_title: Reconciling the Law of Mass Action with Conductivity Data for Strong
  Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors propose a hypothesis that ions in electrolytes are molecular aggregates
  in combination with water, and use this to reconcile the law of mass action with
  conductivity data for strong electrolytes. They also find that ionic volumes calculated
  from conductivities align with solution volumes calculated from densities, providing
  a confirmation of their hypothesis.

- Ionic Sizes
- Electrolyte Conductivity
- Ostwald's Law
- Ion Hydration
- Ionic Volumes
