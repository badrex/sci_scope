  Performance'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Astronomy
tldr: John Hadley's catadioptric telescope is a novel design that combines a mirror
  and lens to create a more compact and efficient instrument for astronomical observation.
  The device uses a concave metal speculum and an oval plane to focus light, allowing
  for improved magnification and clarity. This innovative design offers a new approach
  to telescope construction and has the potential to revolutionize the field of astronomy.
