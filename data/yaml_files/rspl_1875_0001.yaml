revised_title: Investigating Equipotential Curves and Surfaces Using Tinfoil Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author describes a series of experiments using tinfoil and electrodes to
  study equipotential curves and surfaces. By tracing the points where no current
  flows through a galvanometer, the forms of these curves and surfaces can be determined.
  The results provide insights into the distribution of electric potential and the
  behavior of electric currents in various configurations.
