revised_title: Thermal Properties and Vapour-Density of Ethyl Alcohol
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the thermal properties and vapour-density of ethyl alcohol,
  comparing its behavior to other substances. The research finds that alcohol vapour
  in contact with liquid acquires a normal density at about 50Â°C, and does not exhibit
  the same tendencies as other compounds when temperature and pressure are lowered.
