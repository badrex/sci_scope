scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the volatilisation of extremely thin radioactive deposits,
  focusing on thorium, and explore the factors that influence the process, such as
  the nature of the surface, thickness of the layer, period of heating, temperature,
  and pressure of the surrounding gas.
