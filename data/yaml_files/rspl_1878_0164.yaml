revised_title: 'Investigating the Physiology of Sugar in Relation to Blood: A Comparison
  of Analytical Methods'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: The author compares different methods for determining blood sugar levels and
  finds that the gravimetric method provides more accurate results than Bernard's
  potash process. The study also reveals that sugar can persist in decomposing blood,
  suggesting the presence of another reducing substance.
