scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: Benjamin Collins Brodie investigates the chemical composition of wax, specifically
  Cerin, and discovers that it is a hydrated acid, which he names Cerotic acid. He
  also finds that Cerotic acid is present in European beeswax but absent in Ceylon
  beeswax, highlighting the variation in an animal secretion under different conditions.
