scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Bonding
tldr: James Watt investigates the composition of water and dephlogisticated air through
  experiments involving the deflagration of a mixture of these two airs. He concludes
  that the deflagration produces a quantity of water equal in weight to the airs,
  suggesting that water may be composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived
  of their latent heat.
