tldr: This paper presents a third supplementary calculation of Euler's Constant using
  increasingly larger values of 'n'. The author, William Shanks, discusses the potential
  changes in the decimal places when 'n' is increased further and the relationship
  between Euler's Constant and the Infinitesimal Calculus.
