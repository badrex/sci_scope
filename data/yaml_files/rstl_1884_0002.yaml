revised_title: On the Circulation of Air in Kundt's Tubes and Allied Acoustical Problems
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the circulation of air in Kundt's tubes and related
  acoustical problems, focusing on the formation of vortices and the influence of
  the bottom of the tube on the motion. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of air currents and the formation of dust figures in the tubes.
