  Random in a Plane
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Probability & Statistics
tldr: The author investigates the application of local probability to straight lines
  drawn at random in a plane, developing a method to calculate the number of random
  lines meeting a given closed convex plane boundary and proving that the measure
  of this number is equal to the length of the boundary.
