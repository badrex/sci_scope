revised_title: The Influence of Atmospheric Pressure on Combustion Phenomena and Flame
  Luminosity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author investigates the effect of atmospheric pressure on combustion phenomena,
  particularly in time-fuses and gas flames. The results show that the rate of combustion
  in time-fuses is affected by pressure, while the luminosity of gas flames decreases
  with reduced pressure. The study also reveals that the light of flames is derived
  from the separation of carbon particles, which is influenced by the interpenetration
  of flame gases and exterior air.
