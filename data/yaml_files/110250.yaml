revised_title: Discovery of Chloro-Nitrous Gas and Its Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: Edmund Davy discovers a new gas, chloro-nitrous gas, formed by the combination
  of chlorine and nitrous gas. He examines its properties, reactions with various
  substances, and its formation from the mutual action of nitric and muriatic acids.
  Davy also compares chloro-nitrous gas to nitro-muriatic acid and discusses their
  similarities and differences in chemical reactions.
