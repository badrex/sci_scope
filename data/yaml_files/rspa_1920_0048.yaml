revised_title: The Inactivity of Electrolytically Deposited Copper as a Catalyst
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the catalytic activity of electrolytically deposited
  copper and finds that it is inactive for the formation of acetaldehyde from ethyl
  alcohol at temperatures between 20°C and 30°C. The study explores various methods
  of copper deposition and their effects on catalytic activity.
topics:
- Catalysis
- Copper Catalysts
- Catalytic Activity
- Chemical Reactions
- Temperature Dependence
