revised_title: On a Spherical Vortex and its External Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a fluid in a spherical vortex and its
  external motion. They find that the motion outside the sphere is continuous with
  the rotational motion inside the sphere, provided a certain relation is satisfied.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Vortex Theory
- Spherical Vortex
- Rotational Motion
- Ellipsoidal Motion
