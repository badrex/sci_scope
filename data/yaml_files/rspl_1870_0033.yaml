revised_title: Measurement of Internal Resistance in a Multiple Battery
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering
tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the internal resistance of a multiple
  battery by adjusting the galvanometer to zero. The formula R = S / (E - e) is provided,
  where R is the internal resistance, S is the resistance of the shunt, E is the number
  of cells tested, and e is the number of cells opposed.
