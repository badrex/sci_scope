revised_title: Investigations on the Production of Rare Gases through Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors attempt to produce rare gases like neon and helium through electric
  discharges in vacuum tubes. They find that while argon is produced in some experiments,
  they could not detect any neon or helium. The presence of argon is attributed to
  a possible leak in the apparatus, and the entire investigation is considered negative
  for the production of rare gases.
