scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author presents an improved electrical apparatus that increases electrical
  power, ensures operator safety, and enhances convenience for experiments. The design
  includes lining the glass cylinder with a specific composition, using a single wire
  instead of a chain for discharging jars, and a discharging frame that prevents the
  operator from receiving any shock.
