revised_title: 'Researches on the Theory of Vortex Rings: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics
tldr: This article investigates the more general case of vortex rings with different
  core densities and additional circulations. It explores the formation of hollows,
  the stability of the rings, and the effects of core density and additional circulations
  on the ring's behavior.
topics:
- Vortex Rings
- Fluid Dynamics
- Circulation
- Core Density
- Stability
