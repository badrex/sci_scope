tldr: The author describes a unique case of a human heart with a single auricle and
  ventricle, and an unusual arterial and venous arrangement. This heart had a single
  arterial trunk that divided into the aorta and pulmonary artery, bypassing the typical
  double-chambered structure. The child lived for seven days before passing away,
  and the heart was studied post-mortem to understand its structure and function.
