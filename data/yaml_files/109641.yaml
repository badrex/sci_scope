revised_title: Fairy-Ring Formation and Fungi
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mycology & Plant Biology
tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the formation of fairy-rings
  in grass and discovers that they are caused by certain fungi species. He explains
  that the fungi absorb all nutrients from the soil, causing the grass to die temporarily.
  As the fungi grow outward from a central point, the soil becomes enriched with their
  decayed roots, allowing the grass to grow vigorously again. Wollaston also observes
  that different species of fungi require the same nutrients, causing fairy-rings
  to be obliterated when they intersect.
