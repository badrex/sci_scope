revised_title: 'Osmotic Pressures of Calcium Ferrocyanide Solutions: Part II - Weak
  Solutions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the osmotic pressures, densities, and electric conductivities
  of weak calcium ferrocyanide solutions. They find that the observed osmotic equilibrium
  pressures are higher than those calculated from Boyle's law, suggesting ionization
  in the solutions. The study also reveals that the greater the dilution, the greater
  the ionization, indicating dissociation into three ions or molecules.
