tldr: W. Hopkins investigates the phenomena of precession and nutation, considering
  the Earth's interior as a heterogeneous fluid. He extends the inquiry to the case
  of both the interior fluid and external shell being heterogeneous, and discusses
  the implications for the Earth's history and past temperature changes.
