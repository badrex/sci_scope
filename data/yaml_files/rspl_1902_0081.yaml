tldr: This paper explores the application of quaternions in projective geometry, specifically
  focusing on transformation properties and line transformations. The author demonstrates
  the use of quaternions in expressing projective properties and discusses the decomposition
  of line transformations. Additionally, the paper covers the principle of reciprocity
  and its application to geodesics.
