revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Growths in Colloidal Silica Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Colloidal & Surface Chemistry
tldr: The author examines the growths in colloidal silica solutions and concludes
  that the organized bodies observed by Dr. Charlton Bastian were not living organisms
  but rather colloidal simulacra formed by the slow deposition of silica from the
  solutions.
