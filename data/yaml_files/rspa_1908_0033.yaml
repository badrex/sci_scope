revised_title: Comparison of the Board of Trade Ampere-Standard Balance with the Ayrton-Jones
  Current-Weigher
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Measurements
tldr: The authors compare the Board of Trade ampere-standard balance with the Ayrton-Jones
  current-weigher and find that the currents measured by the Board of Trade balance
  are approximately 0.3% smaller than their values in terms of the Ayrton-Jones balance.
  The results confirm the accuracy and consistency of the instruments and support
  the principle of the balance.
