scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Toxicology & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author, Dr. Joseph Del Papa, documents the strange effects of the Indian
  Varnish on human skin, causing inflammation, swelling, and itching. The exact cause
  of these effects remains unknown, but the author speculates that the Varnish may
  contain a substance that reacts with the skin's oils or glands. The Varnish is also
  found to be composed of a gummy and unctuous matter, possibly derived from a resinous
  herb or animal fat.
