tldr: Sir Humphry Davy conducts experiments on the combustion of diamonds and other
  carbonaceous substances, discovering that the gas produced in the process is chemically
  identical to that produced in the combustion of common charcoal. He also finds that
  diamonds do not produce any peculiar matter during combustion and that they lose
  their lustre rather than becoming black.
