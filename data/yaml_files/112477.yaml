  Urine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Organic Chemistry
tldr: The author discovers a crystalline fatty acid in human urine and describes its
  isolation and characterization process. The fatty acid exhibits properties similar
  to other fatty acids in its class, such as palmitic and stearic acid. However, the
  exact composition and quantity of the substance remain undetermined due to the limited
