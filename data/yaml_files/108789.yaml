revised_title: 'On the Strains in Beams: A New Theory by George Biddell Airy'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a new theory for calculating strains in the interior of
  beams, focusing on the weight of the beam and its load in use. The theory considers
  the effects of tension and compression on the beam's lamina and provides a method
  for calculating the forces acting on it.
