scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Sciences
tldr: 'The author, Thomas Boys, investigates the steam-wave phenomenon, which occurs
  during the motion of steam vessels on water. He explains that steam-waves are generated
  by two sets of waves: those caused by the vessel''s progressive motion and those
  resulting from the action of the paddles. The cumulative force of these waves creates
  a powerful impact against obstacles, posing a threat to small vessels.'
