revised_title: The Inhibitory Action of Rabbits' Sera on the Hemolysis of Blood by
  Saponin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the inhibitory effects of rabbit sera fed on different
  diets on the hemolytic action of saponin on blood. They find that cholesterol in
  the diet affects the inhibitory action of the sera, suggesting that cholesterol
  may play a role in the animal's metabolism.
