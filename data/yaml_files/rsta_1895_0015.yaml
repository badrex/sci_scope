revised_title: On the Specific Heats of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons and Their Monohalogen
  Derivatives
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the specific heats of unsaturated hydrocarbons and their
  monohalogen derivatives, finding that the ratio of specific heats remains constant
  for each compound. They also suggest that the configuration of a molecule plays
  a role in the distribution of energy, challenging the idea of an intrinsic heat
  capacity for atoms.
