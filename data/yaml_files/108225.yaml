revised_title: The Influence of Iodine on Photographic Paper Sensitivity and a New
  Method for Producing Sharper Images
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of iodine on photographic paper sensitivity
  and discovers a new method of producing sharper images by using a combination of
  heat and nitric acid treatment. This method allows for better control over the oxidation
  process, resulting in more precise and detailed images.
