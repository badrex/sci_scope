revised_title: 'The Life-History of Bacterium Termo and Micrococcus: Further Observations
  on Bacillus'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the life-history of Bacterium termo and Micrococcus,
  discovering that Bacterium termo undergoes a life-cycle similar to Bacillus anthracis,
  while Micrococcus appears to be a distinct organism or a phase in the life-history
  of another bacterium. The study also reveals that desiccation destroys bacterial
  rods but has no effect on spores or Micrococci, suggesting that these organisms
  can survive in the atmosphere and reanimate in suitable conditions.
