revised_title: 'Variation in Portunus Depurator: A Study of Crab Growth and Morphology'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Morphology
tldr: This study investigates the variation in the morphology of the crab species
  Portunus depurator, analyzing measurements of 2,300 crabs over a period of two years.
  The research focuses on seven dimensions and reveals that the mean values of these
  dimensions change throughout the crab's life, with the forehead becoming relatively
  shorter as the crab grows. The findings suggest that the generalised probability
  curve for the data is close to a normal distribution.
