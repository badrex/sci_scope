revised_title: 'Ionisation of Heavy Gases by X-Rays: A Study of Radiator Efficiency'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the ionisation of heavy gases by X-rays and determine
  the efficiency of various radiators. They find that the ionisation curves are straight
  lines, and calculate the ionisation efficiency for different gases and radiators.
