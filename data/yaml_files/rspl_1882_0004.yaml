  Various Conditions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the structure of liver cells in various animals and documents
  the changes that occur in the cells during fasting and digestion. The study reveals
  that the liver cells have a common structure in their resting state, but also exhibit
  minor differences depending on the animal species. The author also identifies the
  role of glycogen in the liver cells and its changes during different conditions.
