scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author, Arthur Hill Hassall, investigates the frequent occurrence of indigo
  in human urine and its chemical and physiological relations. He discovers that indigo
  is formed through a process of oxidation when urine is exposed to air and light,
  and that it is often accompanied by a brown extractive resembling hematin. Hassall
  also discusses the differences between indigo and other related compounds, such
  as cyanurine and apoglaucin.
