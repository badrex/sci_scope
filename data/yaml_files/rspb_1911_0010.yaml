  in Bacillus Lactis Aerogenes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the action of Bacillus lactis aerogenes on glucose and
  mannitol, focusing on the production of 2:3 butanediol and acetylmethylcarbinol.
  They explore the effect of free oxygen on their production and the organism's action
  on fructose.
topics:
- Bacterial Metabolism
- Butanediol
- Acetylmethylcarbinol
