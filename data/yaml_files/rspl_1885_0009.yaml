tldr: The authors present the results of the harmonic analysis of tidal observations,
  explaining the method of harmonic analysis and its application to determine the
  height of water due to specific tides at any given time. They also discuss the collected
  data from various ports and the importance of accurate observations for the analysis's
  success.
