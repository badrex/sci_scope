revised_title: Endophytic Adaptation in Erysiphe graminis under Cultural Conditions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Pathology & Mycology
tldr: The author investigates the endophytic adaptation of Erysiphe graminis under
  controlled conditions, finding that the fungus can penetrate internal tissues and
  produce haustoria in mesophyll, sheath cells of bundles, and lower epidermal cells.
  This adaptation allows the fungus to grow vigorously on wounded host-plants, demonstrating
  a departure from its normal strictly ectoparasitic habit.
