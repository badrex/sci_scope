revised_title: Elementary Considerations on Rotatory Motion and its Applications
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates rotatory motion using prime and ultimate ratios, applying
  the principles to the motion of a peg-top, the effect of the earth's rotation on
  a falling body, and the direction of flight of a cannonball. The author also critiques
  the Foucault experiment for proving the earth's rotation due to its minute errors
  and difficulty in avoiding them.
