revised_title: High-Pressure Gaseous Combustion Experiments
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the combustion of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide
  at high pressures, exploring the explosion behavior and oxygen distribution in these
  mixtures. Their findings provide insights into the affinities of these gases for
  oxygen and contribute to the understanding of the combustion mechanisms of hydrogen
  and carbon monoxide.
