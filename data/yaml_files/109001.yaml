revised_title: Investigating Diurnal and Annual Inequalities of Terrestrial Magnetism
  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: This article presents a continuation of the study on diurnal and annual inequalities
  of terrestrial magnetism at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1858 to 1863.
  The author discusses the changes in diurnal and annual inequalities, as well as
  the impact of temperature corrections on the results. The study reveals a striking
  change in the diurnal inequalities over the years, with the magnetic action of the
  sun increasing to its original energy levels.
