scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The authors examine over 300 rock and mineral specimens collected by Mr. W.
  M. Conway in the Karakoram-Himalayas. They provide a general summary of the findings
  and details of the most interesting rocks and minerals, including a dark green serpentine,
  hornblendites, and a black-garnet micaceous schist. The study also discusses the
  geological history of the region, noting that sedimentary rocks from various eras
  are folded among crystalline rocks, likely due to earth movements.
