revised_title: 'Vortices in Oscillating Liquid: A Study of Fluid Motion and Surface
  Effects'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the formation of vortices in oscillating liquid, particularly
  in deep water, and explores the effects of surface and bottom boundaries on the
  fluid motion. The study provides insights into the complex behavior of vortices
  and their relationship with the properties of the fluid and the boundaries.
