revised_title: The Persistent Electric Function of the Torpedo's Organ
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the electric function of the Torpedo's organ and discovers
  that it is not a temporary, nerve-driven function. Instead, the organ constantly
  circulates electricity in its environment, and its activity can be renewed through
  nerve stimulation. This research contributes to a better understanding of animal
  electromotive apparatuses.
