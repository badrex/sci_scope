revised_title: Investigating the Effects of a Magnetic Field on the Spectra of Iron
  and Other Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author examines the modifications of the spectra of iron and other substances
  when radiating in a strong magnetic field. They identify four types of effects on
  spectral lines and discuss the implications for understanding atomic and molecular
  vibrations.
topics:
- Magnetic Spectroscopy
- Iron Spectra
- Atomic and Molecular Vibration
- Spectral Line Modifications
- Magnetic Field Effects
