tldr: The author presents a theoretical framework for molecular mechanics, aiming
  to determine the intrinsic constitution of matter and the laws governing molecular
  systems. He discusses the principles of extension, inertia, and active powers, and
  proposes that all natural phenomena can be explained by mechanical forces.
