revised_title: 'Influence of Voltaic Currents on the Diffusion of Liquids: A Study
  of Electrolyte Boundary Phenomena'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effects of voltaic currents on the diffusion of
  liquids, observing phenomena such as the formation of distinct lines at the boundary
  surfaces of electrolyte solutions and the apparent movement of liquid masses. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of electrolytes and their interactions
  under electric current.
