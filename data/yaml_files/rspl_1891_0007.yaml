  Respiration
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the consumption of oxygen and formation of carbonic
  acid in human respiration, determining the proportions of oxygen transformed into
  carbonic acid and retained in the blood. The study aims to understand the effects
  of breathing air containing excess carbon dioxide on the interchange of pulmonary
  gases.
