scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a geometric method for investigating undevelopable uniquadric
  homographics, focusing on the properties of homographic systems of points on plane
  conics. The study is divided into eight chapters, with the main objective being
  the direct, general, and complete solution of a specific problem related to these
  systems.
topics:
- Geometry
- Homographic Systems
- Undevelopable Quadrics
- Conic Sections
- Projective Geometry
