revised_title: 'The Dual Force of the Dividing Cell: Part I - The Achromatic Spindle
  Figure Illustrated by Magnetic Chains of Force'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the dual force of the dividing cell, focusing on the
  achromatic spindle figure and its relation to magnetic chains of force. The study
  explores the role of centrosomes, spindle fibers, and the behavior of chromosomes
  during cell division, suggesting that cell force is of a 'dual' character similar
  to electrostatic force or magnetism.
