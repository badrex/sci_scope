scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author, Mrs. M. Somerville, investigates the effects of different spectral
  rays on vegetable juices. She finds that the action of the spectrum is capricious,
  with changes in color being irregular and unaccountable. The yellow and green rays
  have a powerful influence on vegetable substances, while the red rays have the least
  effect.
