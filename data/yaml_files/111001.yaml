revised_title: Chemical Analysis of a Wax from China and the Discovery of Cerotine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: 'The author, Benjamin Collins Brodie, investigates a wax from China and discovers
  that it is a secretion from an insect. He decomposes the wax using fusion with hydrate
  of potash, obtaining two substances: a wax acid and another body, which he names
  cerotine. Brodie also determines the formula of cerotine and its conversion to cerotic
  acid through oxidation. Additionally, he identifies a hydrocarbon in the wax, which
  he calls cerotine, and discusses its properties and reactions.'
