revised_title: Investigating the Passage of Röntgen Rays through Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Physics of Radiation & X-rays
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption, ionization, and secondary radiation
  produced by Röntgen rays passing through various gases and vapors. They develop
  an apparatus to measure these phenomena and find that the ionization produced in
  the gas is proportional to the pressure of the gas, while the energy of the penetrating
  secondary radiation is also simply proportional to the pressure.
