revised_title: On the Classification and Enumeration of Polyedra
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a method for classifying and enumerating polyhedra based
  on their symmetry, focusing on zoned and zoneless polyedra. The approach involves
  analyzing polar features, constructing perfect polar faces, and using reduction
  and effacement processes to determine the properties of various polyhedra.
