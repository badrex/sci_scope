revised_title: Interference of Light in Hollow Glass Prisms
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates interference patterns in a hollow glass prism filled
  with highly refractive liquids and discovers that the number and visibility of dark
  bands in the spectrum are dependent on the thickness of the glass plate and the
  properties of the liquid medium. The findings offer insights into the behavior of
  light waves and their interactions with different materials.
