revised_title: On Stoney's Logarithmic Law of Atomic Weights and Its Implications
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Bonding & Periodic Table
tldr: Lord Rayleigh examines Dr. Johnstone Stoney's logarithmic law of atomic weights
  and its implications for element classification. Stoney's method of using volumes
  instead of lines to represent atomic weights led to the discovery of a logarithmic
  spiral, which provided a visual representation of atomic weights and their properties.
  This work anticipated the discovery of inert gases and offered insights into the
  chemical properties of elements.
