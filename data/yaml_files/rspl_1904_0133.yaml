  and Correction Techniques'

tldr: This article explores the theory of symmetrical optical objectives, focusing
  on the correction of astigmatism, spherical aberration, and curvature of field.
  The author demonstrates that a combined system can be completely corrected for these
  issues, provided the back component is appropriately adjusted. The conclusions align
  with Dr. W. Zschokke's findings on Goerz double symmetrical lenses.
