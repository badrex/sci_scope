revised_title: Investigating the Sugar-Forming Function of the Liver
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the sugar-forming function of the liver and concludes
  that the presence of sugar in the liver after death is a post-mortem occurrence,
  not a representation of the liver's condition during life. The study also suggests
  that the liver's sugar-forming function is influenced by factors such as temperature
  and diet.
