revised_title: Exploration of Color Phenomena in Thin Plates
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: John Knox investigates color phenomena in thin plates, discovering new fringes
  and rings of colors caused by the interaction of light with the surfaces of the
  plates. He also examines the effects of different mediums on these phenomena and
  suggests that the interaction between the plate's surfaces and light may be the
  cause of these effects.
