revised_title: On the Refraction of Sound by the Atmosphere and its Influence on Long-Distance
  Hearing
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the refraction of sound by the atmosphere and its effect
  on long-distance hearing. They discover that on calm days with a downward temperature
  gradient, sound can travel further due to increased refraction, allowing distant
  sounds to be heard more clearly.
topics:
- Sound Refraction
- Atmospheric Temperature Gradient
- Lon
- Sound Propagation
- Wind and Sound
