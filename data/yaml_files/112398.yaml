revised_title: Observing Solar Prominences without an Eclipse
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Spectroscopy
tldr: William Huggins describes a method of viewing solar prominences without an eclipse
  using a spectroscope and a ruby glass filter. By limiting the refrangibility of
  the light entering the telescope, he was able to observe the form of the prominence.
  Huggins plans to modify the method to make the outline of these objects more easily
  visible.
