revised_title: Investigating Slow Combustion and the Preservation of Light in Gaseous
  Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the slow combustion of gaseous mixtures without
  flame and discovers a method to preserve continued light in inflammable gas and
  air mixtures using heated platinum wires. This method can be applied to coal miners'
  lamps, providing safer and more efficient lighting in hazardous environments.
