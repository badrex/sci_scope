revised_title: Acoustic Figures and Vibrating Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: Charles Wheatstone investigates the figures formed by strewing sand on vibrating
  surfaces, also known as acoustic figures. He proposes a notation system for expressing
  the figures resulting from the vibrations of square or rectangular plates and analyzes
  the various phenomena observed under these circumstances. Wheatstone also examines
  the effects of superposition and the role of quiescent points, points of compensation,
  and transitional figures in the formation of these patterns.
