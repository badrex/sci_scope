revised_title: The Velocity of Reaction in the Absorption of Specific Agglutinins
  by Bacteria and in the Adsorption of Agglutinins, Trypsin, and Sulphuric Acid by
  Animal Charcoal
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of reaction in the absorption of specific
  agglutinins by bacteria and the adsorption of agglutinins, trypsin, and sulphuric
  acid by animal charcoal. They compare the reaction velocities and discuss the differences
  in the processes, providing insights into the nature of these interactions.
