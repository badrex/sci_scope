revised_title: Investigations on the Excretion of Nitrogen by the Skin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the excretion of nitrogen
  by the skin, using a unique method to collect and analyze sweat samples. The results
  provide evidence for the existence of nitrogen in sweat, challenging previous findings
  that suggested no nitrogen was excreted through the skin.
