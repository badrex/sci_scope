tldr: Lieutenant Henry Foster corrects the reductions of his observations on atmospheric
  refractions at Port Bowen, addressing errors in the value of a division of the long
  level of the repeating circle used in the observations. The corrections affect the
  7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th tables, and are submitted to the Royal Society
  for review.
