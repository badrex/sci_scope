scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mammalian Paleontology & Evolution
tldr: The author examines the pelvic structure of Thylacoleo carnifex, an extinct
  carnivorous marsupial, and compares it to other marsupials and existing carnivorous
  mammals. The analysis reveals similarities with dasyurine and diprotodont marsupials,
  suggesting that Thylacoleo carnifex was more closely related to these groups than
  previously thought.
