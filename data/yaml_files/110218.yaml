scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author, James Farquharson, investigates the effect of the Aurora Borealis
  on the magnetic needle and concludes that the phenomenon is related to magnetism
  and electricity. He believes the aurora to be an effect of the development of electricity
  from the condensation of vapor and suggests that it occurs in the region above clouds.
