revised_title: Catalytic Actions of Carbon Monoxide and Steam on Iron Oxide and Copper
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Catalysis & Surface Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the catalytic actions of carbon monoxide and steam on
  iron oxide and copper, finding that copper is less effective than iron oxide at
  higher temperatures but more active at lower temperatures. They also observe that
  water can form an active association with copper in certain chemical reactions.
