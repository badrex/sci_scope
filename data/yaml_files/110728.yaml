tldr: Gideon Algernon Mantell describes the discovery of a portion of the lower jaw
  of an Iguanodon and other Saurian fossils in Tilgate Forest, Sussex. He provides
  a detailed analysis of the osteological characters and relations of the extinct
  animals, comparing them to existing species of Saurian reptiles. The Iguanodon is
  identified as a herbivorous reptile, and its feeding habits are inferred based on
  the structure of its bones.
