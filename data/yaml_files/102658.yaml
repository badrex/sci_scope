scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Calculus
tldr: The authors present a method for squaring the portions of the Lunula of Hippocrates
  Chius, a mathematical problem involving the relationship between a curved shape
  and a rectilinear figure. They demonstrate that the method can be applied to other
  lunulas as well, and discuss the broader implications of their findings.
