scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author, John MÃ¼ller, discovers four distinct hearts with regular pulsations
  connected to the lymphatic system in certain amphibious animals. These hearts are
  found in frogs, toads, salamanders, and green lizards, and play a role in propelling
  lymph in the lymphatic vessels, similar to the heart's function in the blood circulation.
