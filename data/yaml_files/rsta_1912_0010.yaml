revised_title: 'Radiation in Explosions of Coal-Gas and Air: A Study of Heat Loss
  and Diathermancy'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the heat radiation emitted during the explosion and
  subsequent cooling of coal-gas and air mixtures. They use a bolometer to measure
  the radiation transmitted through various materials, providing insights into the
  heat loss and diathermancy of the gaseous mixtures.
