revised_title: Investigating the Permeability of Transparent Screens by Radiant Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments to demonstrate that invisible radiant heat can
  pass through thin transparent screens, challenging previous claims that heat only
  travels through solid materials. The findings support the idea that radiant heat
  can permeate transparent screens in a similar manner to how light passes through
  water or other transparent fluids.
