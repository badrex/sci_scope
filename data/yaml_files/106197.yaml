revised_title: Rectification of the Hyperbola and Applications in Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates a general theorem for finding the length of any arc
  of a conic hyperbola using two elliptic arcs. The theorem is applied to calculate
  the time of descent for a heavy body moving along a circular arc, demonstrating
  the connection between conic sections and mechanics.
