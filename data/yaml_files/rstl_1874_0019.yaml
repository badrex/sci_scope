tldr: The author discusses the challenges in classifying and organizing fossil ferns
  from the coal measures, particularly in identifying and grouping them based on their
  vascular bundles. They propose a common genus, Bachiopteris, to encompass various
  condensed genera and use provisional specific names until more information is available
  about the relationships between these plants.
