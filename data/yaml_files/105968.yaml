tldr: Edward Wortley Montagu examines Pompey's Pillar in Egypt and discovers a hidden
  medal of Vespasian, suggesting that the pillar was erected in his honor rather than
  Pompey's. Montagu also notes the reversed hieroglyphics and the weak pedestal, which
  support his theory that the pillar was not from antiquity.
