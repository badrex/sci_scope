scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author presents a direct method for measuring the coefficient of volume
  elasticity of metals using fluid pressure and a cylindrical tube. The method allows
  for the linear contraction or extension in any given direction to be measured independently
  of other changes of form. Results are provided for steel, copper, and brass tubes,
  showing the effects of annealing on the coefficient of volume elasticity.
