revised_title: Investigating the Conductivity of Vapour in Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine if vapour is a conductor
  of electricity. They find that vapour from boiling water can conduct electricity,
  and that the presence of vapour increases the divergence of electrified objects.
