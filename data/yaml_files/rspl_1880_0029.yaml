scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author examines the pseudonuclei in the vitellus of immature ovarian ova
  in birds and suggests that they are condensations of vitelline substance rather
  than products of immigrated white blood-corpuscles. They also clarify the distinction
  between the convoluted tube and Wolffian body.
