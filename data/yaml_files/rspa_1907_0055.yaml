revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Double-Refraction in Strained Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the double-refraction in strained
  glass using a glass slab under flexure and analyzing the spectrum lines. This method
  allows for continuous observation of the double-refraction throughout the spectrum
  and provides a way to determine the absolute changes in the refractive indices of
  the polarized rays.
