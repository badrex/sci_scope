revised_title: Investigations on the Transmission of Detonation through Explosive
  Agents and Materials
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Explosives
tldr: The author investigates the conditions required for detonation in explosive
  substances and the transmission of detonation through tubes. The study reveals that
  factors such as the nature of the explosive, the diameter and material of the tube,
  and the resistance to the gas-wave play a crucial role in the transmission of detonation.
  The author also explores the influence of dilution on the susceptibility of explosive
  compounds to detonation.
