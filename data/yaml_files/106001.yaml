tldr: Ensign George Sproule observed the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's satellites
  in 1768, using a reflecting telescope and a pendulum time-piece. The observations
  were made at the South Point of the Entrance of Gaspee Bason, and the data was communicated
  by the Astronomer Royal. The study aimed to determine the latitude of the observation
  site and the variation of the needle, as well as to provide accurate time measurements
  for the celestial events.
