scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Electrophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the impact of respiration on the electrical axis of
  the human heart, discovering that during inspiration, the strong leads weaken and
  the weak leads strengthen in oblique and vertical hearts. In horizontal hearts,
  the effects of respiration are different, with inspiratory diminution and expiratory
  augmentation.
