tldr: This article by Arthur Cayley focuses on the development of the theory of binary
  quantics, providing definitions and explanations for various covariants and invariants.
  It also introduces concepts such as the catalecticant, lambdaic, and canonisant,
  which are related to the reduction of a binary quantic to its canonical form.
