revised_title: Lymphatic Glands and Trypanosomes in Sleeping Sickness
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathology
tldr: The authors examine the lymphatic glands of sleeping sickness patients and find
  a high number of actively motile trypanosomes. They believe that this discovery
  supports the idea that the disease is caused by trypanosomes and that the lymphatic
  gland enlargement is a result of the trypanosomes being trapped and destroyed in
  the glands, with some escaping into the bloodstream.
