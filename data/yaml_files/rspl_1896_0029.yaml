revised_title: 'Freezing-Point Curves of Binary Alloys: Silver, Copper, and Other
  Metals'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors present the results of experiments on the freezing points of binary
  alloys containing silver, copper, or another metal. They use platinum electrical
  resistance pyrometers to measure temperature and discuss the freezing-point curves,
  eutectic points, and the behavior of various alloys. The study provides insights
  into the formation and properties of binary alloys and their potential applications.
