revised_title: 'The Nature of Ions Produced by the Spraying of Water: Further Investigations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the nature of ions produced by spraying water and find
  that there are five distinct groups of ions with varying mobilities. They also discover
  a negative field in the apparatus, which affects the determination of mobilities
  for faster ions.
topics:
- Ionization
- Electrification
- Ion mobility
- Water ionization
- Electrostatics
