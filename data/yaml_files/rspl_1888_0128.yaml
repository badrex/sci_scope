  Pearls
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author examines the internal structure and formation of both sedimentary
  and crystalline pearls, comparing them to mineral concretions and other natural
  formations. The study reveals similarities in the arrangement of mineral layers
  and the presence of various nuclei, challenging the longstanding debate over whether
  pearls belong to the animal or mineral kingdom.
