revised_title: On the Specific Heat of Steam at Atmospheric Pressure between 104째C
  and 115째C
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The authors investigate the specific heat of steam at atmospheric pressure between
  104째C and 115째C using a differential throttling calorimeter. They find that the
  specific heat decreases with increasing temperature, indicating a deviation from
  Regnault's formula for the rate of variation of the total heat of saturated steam.
