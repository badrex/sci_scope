revised_title: Experiments on the Production and Properties of Hepatic Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the production and properties of hepatic air, a species
  of permanently elastic fluid obtained from combinations of sulfur with various substances.
  The experiments reveal that hepatic air is produced during the gradual decomposition
  of sulfur compounds and has unique properties such as a disagreeable smell, inflammability,
  miscibility with water, and the ability to discolour metals.
