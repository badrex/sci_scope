tldr: Delisle discusses the construction of quicksilver thermometers and his observations
  on the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, providing new tables for calculating these
  events. He also explores the use of thermometers for comparing temperatures in different
  countries and adjusting barometers for varying temperatures.
