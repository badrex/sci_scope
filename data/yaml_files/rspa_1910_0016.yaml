revised_title: Investigation of Color Extinction through Luminosity Reduction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the extinction of color by reducing luminosity using an
  annulus and a spectroscope. The results show that different colors require varying
  amounts of luminosity reduction to disappear, with some colors losing their color
  earlier than others.
