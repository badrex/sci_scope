tldr: H. F. Baxter investigates the presence of current force during the lacteal absorption
  process in living animals. By using a galvanometer, he observes an effect on the
  needle when electrodes are placed on the intestine's mucous membrane and the chyle
  from the lacteal. This suggests that chyle is positive and may be related to changes
  during secretion and lacteal absorption.
