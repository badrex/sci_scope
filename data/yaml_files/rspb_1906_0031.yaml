revised_title: The Mechanism of Voges and Proskauer's Reaction for Certain Bacteria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the Voges and Proskauer's reaction, a color test for
  certain bacteria, and find that it is caused by acetylmethylcarbinol, which is produced
  by the bacteria's action on glucose. The acetylmethylcarbinol is then oxidized to
  diacetyl, which reacts with a constituent of peptone water, resulting in the characteristic
  fluorescent coloration.
