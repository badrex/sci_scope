revised_title: Experiments on Animal Fluids and the Effects of Atmospheric Pressure
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on animal fluids in an exhausted receiver and
  concludes that atmospheric pressure has a significant impact on blood properties.
  The findings suggest that animal bodies can withstand greater atmospheric pressure
  variations without inconvenience and that the presence of atmospheric air in blood
  samples can lead to erroneous experimental results.
