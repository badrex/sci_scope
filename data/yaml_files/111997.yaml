  Field
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: This paper analyzes 177 magnetic storms recorded by the magnetic instruments
  in the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. The author investigates
  the effects of these storms on Earth's magnetic field and discusses the possible
  causes, such as galvanic currents or the magnetic ether. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of the magnetic field during these disturbances and suggests future
  directions for research.
