scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Henry Bond, a renowned navigation teacher, presents his findings on the variation
  of the magnetic compass and the inclination of the inclinatory needle after 38 years
  of study. He explains the cause of the variation, calculates historical data, and
  demonstrates how to find longitude using the inclinatory needle.
