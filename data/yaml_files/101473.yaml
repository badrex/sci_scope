revised_title: Francesco Redi's Observations on Viper Poison and its Effects
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: Francesco Redi's experiments reveal that viper poison is not found in their
  teeth, tail, or gall, but rather in the two vesicles covering their teeth. He also
  disproves common beliefs about the dangers of consuming viper flesh, venom, or their
  salt, and demonstrates the effectiveness of sucking a viper bite as a remedy.
