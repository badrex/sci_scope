  Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the nature of triple prussiates, or ferruretted chyazates,
  and their unique properties. They discover that these compounds are binary compounds
  of an acid with a single base and propose new names for the associated acids. The
  author also analyzes the composition of triple prussiates, including ferruretted
  chyazate of potash, and discusses the implications of their findings for the field
  of chemistry.
