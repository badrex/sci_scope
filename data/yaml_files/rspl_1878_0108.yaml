revised_title: Tidal Distortion and Secular Cooling of a Viscous Spheroid
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodynamics & Tectonics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of tidal distortion and secular cooling
  on a viscous spheroid, concluding that the distortion is likely responsible for
  the orientation of continents and that the heat generated by tidal friction has
  a negligible impact on the Earth's cooling process.
