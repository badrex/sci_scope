revised_title: On the Stability of Equilibrium in Rotating Systems
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the stability of equilibrium in rotating systems, considering
  both ordinary and permanent stability. The study includes examples of a particle
  on a rotating spherical bowl and a pendulum hanging from a rotating spindle, demonstrating
  how friction affects the stability of these systems.
