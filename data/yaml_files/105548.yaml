tldr: The author examines different extracts of hemlock from various locations and
  finds that the Coimbra extract contains a higher concentration of active principles,
  such as an essential oily salt and resin. This may explain its greater success in
  treating certain disorders compared to other extracts. The author suggests using
  spirit of wine to obtain these active components from local hemlock for medicinal
  purposes.
