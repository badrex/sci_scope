revised_title: The Biotite's Infra-Red Radiation Transparency
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Optical Properties
tldr: The author investigates the transparency of biotite to infra-red radiations
  and finds that the transmission is halved at about 2.5 microns. The effect of rising
  temperature significantly increases the absorption of biotite.
