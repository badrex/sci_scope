revised_title: Experiments on the Alloys, Specific Gravity, and Wear of Gold
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effects of various alloys on gold's properties,
  including specific gravity and wear. The experiments reveal that gold alloyed with
  silver and copper is ideal for coinage due to maintaining color and ductility. The
  specific gravity of gold alloys varies depending on the type and proportion of the
  added metal.
