revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Action of Electric Discharge in Electrolytic
  Gas
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical effects of electric discharge in electrolytic
  gas, focusing on the positive columns of various discharges. They determine the
  chemical activity and electric force within these columns, finding that the observed
  chemical effects are not due to recombination of ions or internal radiation. The
  results support the theory that the chemical effects are a result of the motion
  of negative ions in the presence of an electric field.
