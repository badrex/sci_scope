  Roots
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for finding the values of algebraic quantities
  using converging series and demonstrates and extends propositions given by Pappus
  and others. The method can be applied to various types of equations and exponential
  irrational quantities.
