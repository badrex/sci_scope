revised_title: Critical Expansion and Condensation Phenomena of Water Vapour in Various
  Gases
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the condensation of water vapor in various gases, including
  air, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and carbonic acid. They discover that
  a critical expansion is required for rain-like and cloud-like condensation, and
  that the supersaturation needed for each varies depending on the gas. The study
  also reveals the effects of Rontgen rays on condensation in the presence of air
  and hydrogen.
