tldr: Dr. Deidier and Dr. Woodward conducted an experiment in which two dogs were
  fed a large quantity of bile taken from plague victims. The dogs displayed symptoms
  of illness, including lethargy, loss of appetite, and frequent urination. Their
  urine was thick and foul-smelling, and their feces were tinged with the bile. However,
  after a few days, the dogs recovered their health and showed no lasting effects
  from the experiment.
