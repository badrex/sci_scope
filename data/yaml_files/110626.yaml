scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Ichthyology
tldr: John Davy's paper focuses on the male reproductive organs of cartilaginous fishes,
  comparing his previous findings on the Torpedo to MÃ¼ller's work. He provides microscopical
  evidence to support his previous statements and offers conjectures on the functions
  of various organs found in these creatures.
