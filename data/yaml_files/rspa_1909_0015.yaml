revised_title: Specific Heats of Air and Carbon Dioxide at Atmospheric Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This study measures the specific heats of air and carbon dioxide at atmospheric
  pressure using the continuous electrical method at 20°C and 100°C. The results show
  that air has a specific heat of 0.24173 cal/gram-degree at 20°C and 0.24301 cal/gram-degree
  at 100°C, while carbon dioxide has a specific heat of 0.20202 cal/gram-degree at
  20°C and 0.22121 cal/gram-degree at 100°C. The findings are accurate to within one
  part in 1000 and provide a better understanding of the thermal properties of these
  gases.
