revised_title: On the Tangential of a Cubic Curve
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates the tangential of a cubic curve, providing a method
  to calculate the coordinates of the tangential for the general cubic form. The resulting
  expression is obtained by considering the cubic form in canonical form and applying
  a series of mathematical operations to derive the coordinates of the tangential
  point.
