revised_title: Investigation of Phosphorescence Produced by Alpha and Beta Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the phosphorescence produced by alpha and beta rays
  in various substances, including zinc sulfide, willemite, and barium platinocyanide.
  They find that the luminosity excited by alpha particles decreases with prolonged
  exposure, and that the presence of zinc sulfide affects the rate of decay of radium
  emanation.
