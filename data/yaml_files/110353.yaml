revised_title: Mediterranean Volcano Remains and Gas Analysis
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geochemistry
tldr: The author presents an account of a recent Mediterranean volcano's remains,
  including a dangerous shoal and a circular patch of rock. He also discusses the
  chemical composition of the gases rising from the volcano site, which consists of
  oxygenous and azotic gases. The author proposes a theory that this gas mixture is
  disengaged from sea water in contact with hot ashes and cinders, rather than arising
  from the extinct volcano.
