revised_title: Determination of Ionic Velocities Using a Novel Method
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author develops a new method to determine ionic velocities in electrolytes
  by observing the movement of color boundaries between two salt solutions. The method
  is applied to various salt solutions, and the results are compared to Kohlrausch's
  Law, showing good agreement. The specific ionic velocities are found to be independent
  of the applied electric potential gradient.
