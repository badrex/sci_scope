revised_title: Experimental Research on Conducting Powers of Wires and Heat Developed
  in Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author investigates the conducting powers of wires for electricity and the
  heat developed in metallic and liquid conductors. He finds that the conducting powers
  are not directly proportional to the lengths of the wires and that the heat developed
  is inversely proportional to the conducting power. The findings contradict the generally
  accepted theory of caloric and support the undulatory theory.
