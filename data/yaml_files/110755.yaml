scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author, Martin Barry, investigates the role of blood corpuscles in the formation
  of various tissues and structures in the body. He finds that blood corpuscles have
  the same appearance and form as other cells and are propagated by the division of
  their nuclei. This study supports the idea that blood corpuscles are a fundamental
  part of cell theory and contribute to the formation of different tissues and organs.
