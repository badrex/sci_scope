revised_title: Investigations on the Electric Discharge with the Chloride of Silver
  Battery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: Drs. De La Rue and H. W. MÃ¼ller investigate the electric discharge using a chloride
  of silver battery and a bell-jar. They study the resistance, pressure, and potential
  required to produce a discharge in various gases, such as air, hydrogen, and carbonic
  acid. The authors also observe a sudden expansion of gas when the terminals are
  connected to the battery, which they attribute to an increase in pressure rather
  than temperature.
