scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors compare the wave-lengths of prominent lines in the spectrum of ordinary
  lead and lead from Joachimsthal pitchblende, finding no significant differences.
  They conclude that the spectra are identical, with no differences greater than 0.03
  A.U. occurring in the observed lines.
