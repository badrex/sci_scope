revised_title: A Novel Self-Restoring Coherer for Hertzian Wave Detection
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Propagation
tldr: Sir Oliver Lodge and his team developed a new form of self-restoring coherer
  that uses a rotating steel wheel and a thin layer of oil to detect Hertzian waves.
  The device is sensitive, reliable, and can receive signals in rapid succession,
  making it suitable for space telegraphy.
