scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: This study compares the properties of phylloporphyrin and hæmatoporphyrin, two
  derivatives of chlorophyll and haemoglobin, respectively. The two substances share
  similarities in their formulae, color, and fluorescence, but also exhibit differences
  in solubility, crystal formation, and absorption spectra. The authors suggest a
  possible relationship between the two compounds and explore the potential for converting
  one into the other or obtaining a common derivative.
