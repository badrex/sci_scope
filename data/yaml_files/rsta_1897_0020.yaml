revised_title: 'A Dynamical Theory of the Electric and Luminiferous Medium: Part III
  - Relations with Material Media'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: In this article, Joseph Larmor presents a dynamical theory of the electric and
  luminiferous medium, focusing on its relations with material media. He discusses
  the aether's properties, the influence of motion through the aether on the dimensions
  of bodies, and the nature of paramagnetism and diamagnetism. Larmor also explores
  the mechanical reaction of radiation and the electric potential-differences established
  by steady finite diffusion.
