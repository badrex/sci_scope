  and Cholera'

tldr: The author investigates the immunization effects of bacterial endotoxins on
  guinea pigs, finding that injections of endotoxins from typhoid, diphtheria, and
  cholera bacteria provide significant protection against subsequent injections of
  living bacteria. The study demonstrates the potential for endotoxins to be used
  in active immunization against these diseases.
