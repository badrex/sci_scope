  in the Violet and Ultraviolet Region
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Photosynthesis
tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of chlorophyll and its derivatives
  in the violet and ultraviolet region of the spectrum using photographic methods.
  They find a characteristic absorption band between the solar lines F and M in all
  examined chlorophyll derivatives, confirming the relationship between chlorophyll
  and haemoglobin, the two main coloring matters in plant and animal kingdoms.
