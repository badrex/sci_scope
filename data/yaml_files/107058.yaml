revised_title: Investigating the Properties and Effects of Heat-Radiating Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to study the properties and effects
  of heat-radiating rays, including solar and terrestrial rays. He distinguishes six
  types of heat and demonstrates that these rays are subject to the laws of reflection
  and refraction, have varying refrangibility, and can be scattered on rough surfaces.
topics:
- Heat Radiation
- Solar Rays
- Terrestrial Rays
- Heat-Producing Rays
- Reflection and Refraction of Heat Rays
