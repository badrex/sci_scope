revised_title: Vitality of Salmon Ova and Their Relation to Species Distribution
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ichthyology & Fish Biology
tldr: John Davy investigates the vitality of salmon ova under various environmental
  conditions and suggests that their ability to survive in moist air and during low
  temperatures may contribute to their distribution across rivers and lakes. This
  research could be useful for understanding fish habitats and migration patterns,
  as well as for stocking rivers with ova.
