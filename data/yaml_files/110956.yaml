tldr: Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sabine presents the results of Captain Lefroy's observations
  of barometrical changes at St. Helena. The study reveals that maximum pressure corresponds
  to the moon's passage over both the inferior and superior meridians, with a minimum
  pressure near the rising and setting of the moon. The lunar atmosphere exerts a
  greater influence on atmospheric pressure during perigee than during apogee.
