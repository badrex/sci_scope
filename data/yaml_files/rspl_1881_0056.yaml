scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Bonding
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the molecular volume of solid
  substances and their chemical composition, proposing a method to determine atomic
  volumes and molecular volumes of elements in compounds. The study reveals that different
  elements can assume various volumes in their compounds, and these diverse volumes
  have a simple numerical proportion.
