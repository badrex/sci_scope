revised_title: A Novel Approach to Convert Heat Energy into Electrical Energy
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates a new method of converting heat energy into electrical
  energy using a galvanic cell with chromic chloride as the electrolyte and tin as
  the positive metal. The electromotive force increases and decreases with temperature
  changes, with the highest recorded at 0.2607 volts at 197°F. Further research is
  needed to determine the efficiency of this element.
