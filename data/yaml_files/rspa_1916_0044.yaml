revised_title: 'Ionisation of Metallic Vapours in Flames: Mercury''s Monochromatic
  Radiation and Electrical Conductivity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the ionisation of metallic vapours, specifically mercury,
  in flames. They find that when mercury vapour emits monochromatic radiation of wavelength
  2536.72 Ã…, it is ionised and exhibits electrical conductivity. This supports the
  conclusion that 4.9 volts is the ionising potential of mercury vapour.
