tldr: John Winthrop examines a passage in Castillione's biography of Sir Isaac Newton,
  arguing that Dr. Pemberton misinterpreted Newton's views on algebraic calculations
  and geometric demonstrations. Winthrop maintains that Newton preferred geometric
  methods and criticized those who used algebraic calculations, such as Descartes.
