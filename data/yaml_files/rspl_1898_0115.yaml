revised_title: Investigating the Efficiency of Oxygen Utilization and Voltaic Action
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the efficiency of oxygen utilization
  and voltaic action in producing heat. The results show that there is no fixed relation
  between oxygen absorbed and heat emitted per individual experiment, but the mean
  efficiency for each person tested is relatively constant. The study also reveals
  that the excess heat produced during exercise is utilized better for work than in
  a state of rest.
