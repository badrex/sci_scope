revised_title: Investigation of Air Flow Resistance and Viscosity in a Pipe
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the resistances to air flow through a pipe and determines
  the coefficient of viscosity of air. The critical velocity for turbulent flow is
  identified, and the resistance to air flow in eddying motion is found to be independent
  of pressure and proportional to the square of the velocity.
