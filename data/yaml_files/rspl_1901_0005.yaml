scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Agriculture
tldr: This study investigates the phosphoric acid and potash contents of wheat soils
  in the Broadbalk Field, Rothamsted, and examines the effects of different manurial
  treatments and crop yields. The research finds that citric acid soluble phosphoric
  acid and potash ratios can be used as indicators of soil fertility, and that the
  descent of phosphoric acid and potash into subsoils varies depending on the type
  of manure used.
