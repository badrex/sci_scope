revised_title: On the Extension and Flexure of Cylindrical and Spherical Thin Elastic
  Shells
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the extension and flexure of cylindrical and spherical
  thin elastic shells, proposing a hypothesis and developing a theory based on the
  assumption that certain stresses can be treated as zero. The study focuses on the
  stresses and forces acting on these shells and their impact on the potential energy
  due to strain.
