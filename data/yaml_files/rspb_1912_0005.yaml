scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of a cyanophoric glucoside and its associated
  enzyme in Lotus corniculatus, a plant that can be found in various environments.
  They find that the presence of hydrogen cyanide and the enzyme is influenced by
  the plant's growth conditions, such as soil type and climate, and that the plant's
  variety plays a significant role in its chemical composition.
