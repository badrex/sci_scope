revised_title: A Comparative Crystallographical Study of Double Selenates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the crystal structure and properties of double selenates
  in the magnesium group, focusing on the salts with potassium, rubidium, and caesium
  as the alkali metal. The study compares the crystallographical properties of these
  salts, providing insights into their structure and morphology.
