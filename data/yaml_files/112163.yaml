tldr: The author examines a muscular individual and identifies numerous anatomical
  abnormalities and variations in their musculature. These include a well-developed
  levator claviculce, a costo-fascialis cervicalis muscle, and a unique extensor brevis
  digitorum manus. The findings suggest a connection between these abnormalities and
  those observed in other animals, such as apes, monkeys, and birds.
