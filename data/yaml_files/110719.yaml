tldr: The author, Martin Barry, provides additional information on the formation of
  the chorion in embryology. He observes that a layer of cells remains around the
  zona pellucida after the thinner membrane has formed, and these cells contribute
  to the thickening of the chorion. He suggests that these cells originate from the
  surrounding cells of the zona and reproduce through nuclear division.
