revised_title: Investigation of Chemical Affinity and Equilibrium in Binary Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of mass and affinity on the reaction between
  binary compounds, finding that the proportions of products depend on the nature
  and mass of the substances involved. This study provides insights into the behavior
  of chemical reactions and the factors influencing their outcomes.
topics:
- Chemical Affinity
- Equilibrium
- Binary Compounds
- Mass Action
- Reaction Rates
