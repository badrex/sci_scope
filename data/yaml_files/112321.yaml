  Materials
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the molecular mobility of gases and their diffusion
  through porous materials, specifically focusing on the use of artificial graphite
  as a diffusion septum. The study provides insights into the factors affecting gas
  diffusion and the role of molecular movement in the process.
