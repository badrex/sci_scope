revised_title: The Chemical Constitution of Isatin and Its Oxidation by Chromic Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical constitution of isatin and its oxidation
  by chromic acid, discovering that isatin is converted into isatoic acid, a nitrogen-benzoyl
  carboxylic acid. The chemical behavior of isatoic acid supports this conclusion
  and its transformation into anthranilic acid is also discussed.
