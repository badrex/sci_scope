revised_title: A Study of the Colour-Relation between the Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus
  and its Food-Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the larva of Smerinthus ocellatus
  and its food-plants, examining how the larval coloration is affected by the food-plant
  and whether the influence is a simple phytophagic or a complex sensory response.
  The study includes breeding experiments, observations in the field, and various
  feeding conditions to test the theories.
