scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Applied Mathematics
tldr: The author presents a method for solving linear differential equations using
  symbolic computation, demonstrating its application to various forms of equations
  and highlighting its practical utility. The method involves converting symbols in
  the equations, leading to new forms of solutions that may be interpretable or not.
  The author also discusses connections between the solutions obtained and those of
  the same equations in the form of definite integrals.
