revised_title: Investigations on the Solubility of Glucina in Carbonate of Ammonium
  and its Impact on the Separation of Earths in Emeralds and Beryls
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the solubility of glucina in carbonate of ammonium and its
  effect on the separation of earths in emeralds and beryls. The study investigates
  the efficiency of the carbonate-of-ammonium process in separating alumina and glucina,
  and the author presents experimental results and findings to support the process's
  accuracy and reliability.
