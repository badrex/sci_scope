revised_title: 'Investigation of Galvanic Cells Produced by Light: A Preliminary Communication'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of galvanic cells under the action of light,
  discovering that they exhibit constant and inconstant cells, reversible and irreversible
  cells. The study also reveals the complex nature of the phenomena observed, which
  can be quantitatively separated and analyzed, providing a physico-mathematical basis
  for understanding these light-induced reactions.
topics:
- Galvanic Cells
- Light-Induced Reactions
