tldr: The author demonstrates the successful transplantation and growth of fertilized
  ova from one rabbit variety to another, showing that the uterus of a different rabbit
  breed can support the development of foreign ova. This experiment provides insight

  and the possibility of using foster-mothers in rabbit breeding.
