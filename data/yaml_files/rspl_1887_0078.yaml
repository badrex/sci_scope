revised_title: 'On Figures of Equilibrium of Rotating Masses of Fluid: Dumb-Bell Shapes
  and Tidal Interactions'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium shapes of two rotating fluid masses
  in close proximity, finding that they form a dumb-bell shape due to tidal interactions
  and their own rotation. The study contributes to understanding the stability and
  dynamics of rotating fluid systems, with implications for celestial bodies and satellite
  formation.
