revised_title: 'On the Development of Marsupial and Tubular Enamels: A Study of Enamel
  Formation in Marsupials and Other Mammals'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author investigates the development of marsupial and tubular enamels, revealing
  that enamel tubes are a product of the enamel organ and not a continuation of dentinal
  tubes. The study provides insights into enamel formation in marsupials and other
  mammals.
