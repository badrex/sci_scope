  Analysis'

tldr: John Kidd investigates the natural production of saltpetre on building walls,
  focusing on the connection between nitre production and atmospheric conditions.
  He observes that saltpetre forms most abundantly in clear frosty weather and is
  influenced by the texture and composition of the stone. Kidd also analyzes the stone
  of the laboratory and the nitre collected, finding that calcareous salt is not a
  significant constituent.
