scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents an orrery designed by James Ferguson that accurately represents
  the phenomena of Venus, including its inclined axis, diurnal motion, and seasonal
  variations. This orrery demonstrates how Venus's unique characteristics, such as
  its proximity to the Sun and the effects of its axis inclination, create a more
  habitable environment than previously thought.
