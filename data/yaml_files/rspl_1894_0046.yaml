  Injection of Peptone
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Inflammation
tldr: The author investigates the disappearance of leucocytes from the blood after
  injecting peptone into rabbits. The study finds that the number of polynuclear leucocytes
  increases in the organs after peptone injection, suggesting a temporary withdrawal
  of these cells from the blood rather than their destruction.
