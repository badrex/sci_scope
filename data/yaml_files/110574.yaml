revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Low Fogs and Stationary Clouds
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, William Kelly, examines the factors influencing the formation of
  low fogs and stationary clouds, particularly in relation to the temperature of water
  and air. He observes that these dense fogs are common when the air is nearly saturated
  with moisture and when the water temperature is either higher or lower than the
  air temperature. These fogs are usually limited in height and distance from the
  shore, and often have clear visibility at higher elevations.
