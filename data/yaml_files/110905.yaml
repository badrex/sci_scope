revised_title: On New Magnetic Actions and the Magnetic Condition of All Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: 'Faraday''s research explores new magnetic actions and the magnetic condition
  of all matter, discovering that different materials are acted upon by magnetic forces
  in two distinct ways, creating two classes: magnetics and diamagnetics. The study
  also reveals that all matter, including gases, is subject to magnetic forces, and
  that magnetic properties of compounds depend on the properties of their constituent
  elements.'
