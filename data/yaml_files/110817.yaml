revised_title: Experiments on the Gas Voltaic Battery and Its Application to Eudiometry
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Batteries
tldr: The author, William Robert Grove, investigates the gas voltaic battery and its
  action, focusing on the rationale behind its function and its application to eudiometry.
  He conducts experiments with various gas combinations and concludes that chlorine
  and oxygen, and hydrogen and carbonic oxide, are the most effective in producing
  a voltaic current. Grove also discusses the battery's potential use in eudiometry
  and explores theoretical views on the contact theory and the source of caloric evolved
  during voltaic action.
