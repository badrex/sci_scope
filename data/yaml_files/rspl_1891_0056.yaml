revised_title: Investigations on the Effects of Vagus Nerve and Nervi Augmentores
  on the Mammalian Heart
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: The authors study the effects of vagus nerve and nervi augmentores on the mammalian
  heart, examining their impact on heart rhythm, force, and volume. They describe
  a cardiometer, myocardiograph, and automatic counter used for measuring heart contractions,
  expansions, and output. The research explores the relationship between the heart
  and blood pressure, as well as the influence of the vagus nerve on heart rhythm
  and the effects of direct excitation of the nervi augmentores on heart function.
