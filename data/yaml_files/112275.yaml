scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author, Peter Griess, explores the formation of new nitrogen-substitution
  compounds and alcohols through chemical reactions. He demonstrates the transformation
  of diazoamidobenzol into a new compound, nitrate of diazobenzol, and discusses the
  properties and reactions of this substance. Griess also discusses the formation
  of new compounds from nitrate of benzidine and nitrate of naphthylamin, as well
  as their decomposition products.
