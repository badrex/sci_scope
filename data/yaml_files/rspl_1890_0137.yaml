revised_title: Magnetization and Recalescence in Steel
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Heat Treatment
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between magnetization and recalescence
  in steel, finding that both temperatures of heat liberation are associated with
  changes in magnetic condition. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  steel during heating and cooling processes.
