revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Pressure on the Temperature of an Electric
  Arc's Crater
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of surrounding gas pressure on the temperature
  of an electric arc's crater. They find that the temperature of the crater is influenced
  by the cooling effect of the surrounding gas rather than the boiling point of carbon.
  The study also reveals that the reduction of radiation observed in previous experiments
  was due to the contamination of nitrogen gas with oxygen and the formation of red
  fumes.
