revised_title: Spherical Vortex Motion and Fluid Dynamics
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a fluid in a spherical vortex, focusing
  on the relationship between rotational motion inside the sphere and the fluid's
  behavior outside the sphere. The study explores the conditions under which the motion
  remains continuous and the implications for fluid dynamics.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Vortex Theory
- Rotational Motion
- Ellipsoidal Geometry
- Helmholtz's Theorem
