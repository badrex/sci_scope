revised_title: The Influence of Cross-Fertilization on Echinoid Larvae
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between hybrid and parent forms of
  echinoid larvae through cross-fertilization experiments. The study reveals that
  the ability to create hybrids depends on the relative maturity of the sexual products
  and the season. Hybrid larvae exhibit a range of characteristics, with some being
  of an almost pure paternal type, while others are intermediate or of a maternal
  type.
