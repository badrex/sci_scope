revised_title: 'Photographic Analysis of Explosions in Magnetic Fields: Investigating
  the Effect of Magnetic Fields on the Propagation of Explosion Waves'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the propagation of
  explosion waves using photographic analysis. They find that a powerful magnet can
  deflect a stream of electrons and modify the form of the explosion wave, suggesting
  a potential relationship between the damping of electron velocity and the initiation
  of chemical change.
