revised_title: Absolute Thermal Radiation Measurements in Copper Globes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the loss of heat from copper globes with
  different surface conditions, finding that the loss of heat by radiation and convection
  varies depending on the surface and surrounding environment.
