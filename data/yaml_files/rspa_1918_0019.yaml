scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Geology
tldr: The author investigates the impact of freezing on clay soils and flocculation,
  finding that freezing causes dehydration and particle aggregation, leading to a
  reduction in the volume of the sediment. The study also examines the effect of various
  substances on the stability of basic copper sulphates and their relevance to flocculation.
