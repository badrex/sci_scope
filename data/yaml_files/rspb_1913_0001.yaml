revised_title: Anatomical Evidence of the Relationship Between Araucarineae and Cordaitales
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author examines the anatomy of various regions of the Araucarineae plant
  and finds evidence of a close relationship with the Cordaitales. This is based on
  the presence of a leaf gap, similar medullary ray structures, and other anatomical
  features. The study supports the idea that Araucarineae are anatomically closely
  associated with Cordaitales.
