revised_title: 'The Capacity Coefficients of Spherical Conductors: A Simplified Approach'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The authors explore the self-capacity coefficients of spherical conductors and
  provide simplified methods for calculating their values, which can be useful in
  determining the electric stress between spherical electrodes and understanding the
  capacity between a sphere and nearby conductors or cavities.
