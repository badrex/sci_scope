revised_title: A New Method for Measuring the Conductivity of Heat Insulators
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors develop a new method to measure the conductivity of heat insulators
  using a steady-state heat transfer system. They test various materials, including
  air, sawdust, charcoal, and hair felt, and find hair felt to be the best insulator
  among them.
