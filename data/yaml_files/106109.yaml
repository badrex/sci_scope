revised_title: Investigating the Presence of Volatile Alcali in Putrefaction
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Analysis
tldr: The author conducts experiments on putrefaction and discovers the presence of
  volatile alcali throughout the process. The volatile alcali is found to be the basis
  of putrefaction, and its presence is essential to the process. The author also suggests
  that volatile alcali may be present in living bodies but cannot be used as antiseptics
  due to its stimulating quality.
