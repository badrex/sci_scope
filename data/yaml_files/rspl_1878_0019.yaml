tldr: The author analyzes the diurnal range of magnetic declination at the Trevandrum
  Observatory, comparing monthly and yearly data from 1854 to 1864. The study reveals
  distinct differences in the annual variation of declination-range between Trevandrum
  and Kew observatories, with two minima and two maxima occurring at different times
  of the year.
