tldr: The author examines the marsupial pouches, mammary glands, and mammary foetus
  of the Echidna Hystrix, providing insights into the reproductive and developmental
  processes of this unique species. The study reveals the presence of marsupial structures
  and the absence of nipples in the mammary glands, suggesting that the Echidna Hystrix
  is not oviparous.
