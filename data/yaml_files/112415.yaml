revised_title: Anatomy of the Hedgehog's Retina Blood-Vessel System
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: J. W. Hulke examines the unique blood-vessel system of the hedgehog's retina,
  revealing that only capillaries penetrate the retina, while larger vessels lie on
  the inner surface. This distinguishes the hedgehog from other mammals, fish, amphibia,
  reptiles, and birds, which have either vascular or non-vascular retinas.
