revised_title: Investigation of Combustion in Dried Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Combustion
tldr: The author investigates the combustion of carbon in dried oxygen and finds that
  the presence of moisture significantly affects the oxidation process. The experiments
  reveal that when oxygen is dried, the combustion of carbon produces mostly carbon
  dioxide, while the presence of moisture leads to the formation of carbon monoxide.
