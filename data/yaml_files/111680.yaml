scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the reaction of nitrous acid on nitrophenylenediamine,
  discovering that it exchanges three hydrogen molecules for one nitrogen molecule,
  with three water molecules eliminated. The new compound exhibits stability and unique
  properties compared to other nitrogenous compounds, further confirming the molecular
  constitution of nitrophenylenediamine.
