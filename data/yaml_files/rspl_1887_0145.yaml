revised_title: In-Depth Analysis of the Oxyhydrogen Flame Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, investigate the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen
  flame and discover that it extends into the visible and ultra-violet regions with
  diminishing intensity. They photograph the spectrum using a single calcite prism
  and a lengthened exposure, observing a series of rhythmical groups with overlapping
  lines. The authors find a resemblance between these groups and certain parts of
  the water spectrum, and also identify lines that match Dr. Grinwald's predictions.
