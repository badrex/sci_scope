revised_title: A Singular Instance of Atmospherical Refraction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author describes a rare instance of atmospherical refraction in which the
  coast of France was visible from Hastings, England, without the aid of a telescope.
  This phenomenon was observed due to a unique combination of weather conditions and
  the position of the sun, allowing the cliffs and landmarks on the opposite coast
  to appear closer and more distinct than usual.
