revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Iron and Other Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Elemental Analysis
tldr: The authors use a Rutherford grating to determine the wavelengths of iron and
  copper spark spectra lines, and deduce the wavelengths of additional lines in the
  arc and spark spectra of iron. They also analyze the ultra-violet lines of various
  elements and observe harmonic relationships between their spectral lines.
