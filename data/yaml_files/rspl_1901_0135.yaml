revised_title: The Relationship between Electrical Resistivity and Specific Heat in
  Iron Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the electric conductivity and
  specific heat of iron alloys, finding that elements with higher atomic weights produce
  a smaller increase in electric resistivity. The study suggests that using specific
  heat as a measure may provide a better understanding of atomic or molecular masses.
