revised_title: Investigating the Velocity of Sound in Metals and Comparing their Elasticities
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Acoustics
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, focusing on the velocity of sound in metals and comparing their moduli
  of longitudinal and torsional elasticity using statical and kinetical methods.
topics:
- Elasticity
- Velocity of Sound
- Metals
- Longitudinal Elasticity
- Torsional Elasticity
