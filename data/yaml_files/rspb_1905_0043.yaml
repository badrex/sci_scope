scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The author investigates the transmission and pathogenicity of Spirillum Theileri,
  a microorganism causing disease in cattle. The study demonstrates that the disease
  can be transmitted through infected ticks and that the infection can be conveyed
  from sick to healthy animals by injecting infective blood. The pathogenic effect
  of Spirillum Theileri is a slight anemia accompanied by fever, and the disease is
  not fatal.
