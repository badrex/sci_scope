revised_title: Optimizing Steam-Engine Cylinder Proportions for Maximum Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machinery
tldr: Francis Blake investigates the optimal proportions for steam-engine cylinders,
  concluding that broader cylinders with reduced length lead to increased efficiency
  and force. This discovery could lead to improvements in steam engine technology
  and its applications in draining mines and other works of art.
