revised_title: Investigating the Weight Gain in Water Upon Freezing
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: George Fordyce conducts experiments to determine the weight changes in water
  when heated or cooled. He discovers that water gains weight when converted into
  ice, and suggests that this may be due to an increase in the attraction of gravitation
  or the imbibition of a substance through the glass container. He also discusses
  the possibility of a pendulum experiment to further investigate this phenomenon.
