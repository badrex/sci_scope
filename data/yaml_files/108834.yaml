scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author investigates the anatomical relationships between the vomer, ethmoid,
  and intermaxillary bones in mammals, particularly focusing on the human skull. The
  study reveals that the sphenoidal spongy bones play a crucial role in the development
  and connections of these bones, and their structure is consistent across different
  mammalian species.
