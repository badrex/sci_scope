scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: This article explores the theory of reproductive or genetic selection and the
  inheritance of fertility, with a focus on human populations and thoroughbred racehorses.
  The authors develop methods to analyze the correlation between fertility and other
  characters, and demonstrate the inheritance of fertility from mothers to daughters
  and from grandmothers to granddaughters through both maternal and paternal lines.
