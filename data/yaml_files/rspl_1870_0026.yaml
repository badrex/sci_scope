revised_title: The Geology of Coal Fields and the Earth's Crust
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Tectonics
tldr: The author investigates the formation of coal fields and the constitution of
  the Earth's crust using pendulum observations and geological data. The study reveals
  that the arrangement of coal fields into basins is due to the intersection of flexures
  and denudation acting on anticlinal arches. The author's hypothesis regarding the
  Earth's crust is supported by the data, suggesting that the variety in the Earth's
  surface elevation and depression has arisen from the mass contracting unequally
  during solidification.
