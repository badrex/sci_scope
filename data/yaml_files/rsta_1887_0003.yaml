revised_title: A Study of the Thermal Properties of Ethyl Oxide and its Impurities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the thermal properties of ethyl oxide, focusing on evaporation
  and dissociation. They compare their findings with previous research and discuss
  the impact of impurities on the properties of ether. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of stable and unstable bodies and contributes to understanding
  chemical combination.
