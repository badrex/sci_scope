scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the minute anatomy of the brachial plexus and its nerve
  supply in 55 dissections, focusing on the spinal nerves, their branches, and the
  muscles they supply. The study provides detailed insights into the connections and
  variations in the brachial plexus, particularly in the supply of the serratus magnus,
  pectoralis major, and coracobrachialis muscles.
