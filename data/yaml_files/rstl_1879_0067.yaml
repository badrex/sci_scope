revised_title: Stresses in Rarified Gases Arising from Inequalities of Temperature
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the stresses in rarefied gases caused by temperature
  inequalities and explains how these stresses can affect the behavior of solid bodies
  immersed in the gas. The study also explores the relationship between tangential
  stresses and the sliding motion of the gas over solid surfaces.
topics:
- Gas Dynamics
- Thermal Stress
- Heat Transfer
- Molecular Collisions
- Rarefied Gas
