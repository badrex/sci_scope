revised_title: On the Numerical Solution of Integral Equations of Abel's Type and
  Poisson's Type
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Numerical Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for solving integral equations of Abel's and Poisson's
  types, focusing on numerical solutions and interpolation techniques. The approach
  involves representing the nucleus function analytically and using the solving function
  to determine the unknown function.
