revised_title: The Attainment of High Potentials Using Radium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of attaining high potentials using radium.
  They successfully obtain high potentials, but due to technical difficulties and
  limitations, they are unable to reach a million volts. The study highlights the
  importance of further research into the reasons behind insulation breakdown in high
  vacuum systems.
