scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reaction between amylamine and bisulphide of carbon,
  discovering a new crystalline compound called amylsulphocarbamate of amylamine.
  The compound is analyzed and compared to similar reactions with phenylamine, leading
  to the formation of diphenylsulphocarbamide. The study highlights the differences
  in the stability of sulphocarbamic acids in the amyl and phenyl series.
