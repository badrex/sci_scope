scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the formation of fat in the intestines of living animals,
  particularly focusing on the role of the colon in extracting secondary nourishment
  from food. The study includes observations of adipocere formation, a process similar
  to that occurring in the lower intestines, and the author concludes that the colon
  plays a crucial role in fat formation.
