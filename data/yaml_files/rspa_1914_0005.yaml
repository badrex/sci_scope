revised_title: Mathematical Representation of Light Pulse and Black Body Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author presents a new mathematical representation of a light pulse and its
  dispersion, which also demonstrates that the energy distribution aligns with Wien's
  law for black body radiation. The study uses a hypothetical medium and explores
  the relationship between wave velocity, group velocity, and dispersive power.
