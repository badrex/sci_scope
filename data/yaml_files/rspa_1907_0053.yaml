revised_title: Development of a Standard of Mutual Inductance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the design and construction of a standard of mutual
  inductance, focusing on the dimensions and positions of primary and secondary coils.
  The proposed design involves two coaxial helixes with a many-layered secondary coil,
  aiming to create a standard that is accurately calculable from geometrical dimensions
  and suitable for use in electrical measurements.
