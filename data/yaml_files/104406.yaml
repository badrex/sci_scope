scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: 'John Fothergill investigates the origin of amber and discusses three possible
  theories: marine production, bituminous body generated in the Earth''s bowels, or
  a vegetable resin transformed by a mineral acid. Fothergill supports the last theory,
  arguing that amber originated from a resinous substance, likely from pine trees,
  and was encased through a natural process involving mineral acids. He also examines
  the inclusion of various organisms in amber and its medicinal properties.'
