revised_title: A Method for Examining the Divisions of Astronomical Instruments
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Observational Techniques
tldr: The author presents a method for examining and measuring the divisions of astronomical
  instruments with high precision. The method involves using a brass arc, a micrometer
  microscope, and a series of comparisons to determine the accuracy of the instrument.
  The author estimates that the time required for this examination is about ninety-eight
  hours, but the confidence gained from the precise measurements is considered well
  worth the effort.
