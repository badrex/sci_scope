  Species'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: The author examines the dentition and tooth development in two species of wart-hogs,
  Phacochoerus aethiopicus and Phacochoerus nasutus. The study reveals the unique
  dental structure and succession in these animals, which deviate from other quadrupeds.
  The research provides a detailed description of the teeth's morphology, development
  stages, and the order of shedding, contributing to the understanding of mammalian
  dentition.
