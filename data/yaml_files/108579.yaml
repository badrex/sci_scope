  Arc Stations

scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the effect of local attraction on the plumb-line at stations
  on the English arc of the Meridian between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor. The study
  reveals that local attraction causes discrepancies in the amplitudes of the measured
  subdivisions of the arc, leading to errors in the determination of the Earth's ellipticity.
