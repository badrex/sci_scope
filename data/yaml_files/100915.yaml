revised_title: Invention and Analysis of a New Catadioptrical Telescope by Isaac Newton
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Isaac Newton invents a new catadioptrical telescope that significantly reduces
  the length of the telescope while maintaining its magnification capabilities. The
  telescope consists of two metal specula, a concave and a flat, and a small plano-convex
  eyepiece. The design allows for increased aperture and reduced chromatic aberration
  compared to refracting telescopes, but challenges remain in finding suitable materials
  for the specula.
