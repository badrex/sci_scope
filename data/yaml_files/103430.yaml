scientific_subdiscipline: Surgery & Anatomical Pathology
tldr: The author describes a case of ossification of the crural artery, which led
  to a patient's leg mortification and eventual death. The patient consented to amputation,
  but the ossification made the procedure challenging. The author believes that such
  cases might be more common than realized and could be a cause of extremity mortification
  in elderly patients.
