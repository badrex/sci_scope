revised_title: On the Defects and Solutions in Algebraic Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author discusses various defects in algebraic equations and proposes methods
  for finding roots, including Cardano's rules and the use of dioristic limits. He
  also explores the possibility of generalizing these methods for higher-dimensional
  equations.
topics:
- Algebra
- Cardano's Formula
- Dioristic Limits
- Resolvend
- Roots of Equations
