revised_title: Experimental Verification of Displacement-Currents in a Dielectric
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents an experimental method to demonstrate the magnetic action
  of displacement-currents in a dielectric, using a condenser with an iron annulus
  and a telephone receiver. The results confirm the reality of the magnetic action
  and suggest potential applications for exploring varying electrostatic fields.
