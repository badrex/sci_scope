revised_title: Experiments on the Production of Dephlogisticated Air and the Properties
  of Nitrous Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: James Watt discusses the process of producing dephlogisticated air and the properties
  of nitrous acids. He provides detailed instructions for purifying nitre and distilling
  dephlogisticated air, as well as explaining the behavior of phlogisticated nitrous
  acid when saturated by an alkali.
