revised_title: Experiments and Observations on the Effects of Various Gases on Spontaneous
  Light
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Kinetics & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author investigates the effects of various gases, such as atmospherical
  air and oxygen gas, on the spontaneous light emitted by different substances like
  herrings, mackerels, and glow-worms. The experiments show that oxygen gas does not
  significantly increase the light's vividness compared to atmospherical air, contrary
  to some authors' claims.
