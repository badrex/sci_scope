revised_title: Investigating Stratification in Electrical Discharges in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Battery Technology
tldr: The authors investigate the cause of stratification in electrical discharges
  in vacuo using a chloride-of-silver battery and vacuum tubes. They find that connecting
  the battery to coil-accumulators creates well-defined stratifications in the vacuum
  tube, suggesting that the periodic overflows of the accumulator's charge may cause
  interference and produce nodes of greater resistance in the medium.
