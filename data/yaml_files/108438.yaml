tldr: Carlo Matteucci's research explores the relationship between muscle contraction
  and the electric current in nerves, as well as the conductibility of muscles and
  nerves. He discovers that the nervous filaments do not contribute to electro-chemical
  decomposition and that the conductibility of muscles is four times greater than
  that of nervous substance.
