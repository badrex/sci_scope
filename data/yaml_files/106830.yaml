revised_title: Decomposition of Heavy Inflammable Air and the Involvement of Light
  Inflammable Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of heavy inflammable air and discovers
  that it contains light inflammable air and phlogisticated air. The experiments involve
  using electrical sparks and heating substances like sulfur and charcoal to decompose
  the heavy inflammable air. The findings contribute to the understanding of the composition
  and properties of these airs.
