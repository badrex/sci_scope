revised_title: Investigating the Strength of Wrought Iron Plates and Riveted Joints
  in Ship-Building
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This paper by William Fairbairn investigates the strength of wrought iron plates
  and riveted joints in ship-building through a series of experiments. The author
  compares the tensile strength of different types of iron and timber, and concludes
  that iron is five times stronger than oak, making iron ships more secure and stronger
  than those built with timber.
