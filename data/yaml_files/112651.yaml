revised_title: The Correlation between Insolation and Atmospheric Humidity
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between insolation and atmospheric
  humidity, finding that the maxima of insolation coincide with periods of maximum
  humidity. This is demonstrated through the analysis of monthly data from Greenwich,
  England, and Toronto, Canada, highlighting the connection between solar radiation
  and vapor tension.
