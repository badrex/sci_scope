scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Geology
tldr: The author, Capt. Newbold, examines the composition of the Règar or black cotton
  soil of India and challenges the prevailing belief that it is formed from the disintegration
  of trap rocks. Instead, he proposes that it is a sedimentary deposit from waters
  in a state of repose, based on his observations of the soil's extensive coverage
  across the Indian peninsula.
