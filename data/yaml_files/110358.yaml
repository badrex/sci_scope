revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Identity of Electricities
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrochemistry
tldr: 'Samuel Hunter Christie''s report on Mr. Faraday''s paper, ''Experimental Researches
  in Electricity: Third Series,'' demonstrates the identity of electricities from
  different sources. The experiments show that common and voltaic electricities share
  similar effects, such as attraction, repulsion, heat evolution, magnetism, chemical
  decomposition, and physiological phenomena. The author concludes that electricity,
  regardless of its source, is identical in nature, with differences in phenomena
  due to varying quantity and intensity.'
