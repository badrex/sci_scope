revised_title: 'The Spectrum of Radium Emanation: Further Investigations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of radium emanation, comparing it to the
  xenon spectrum and employing advanced spectrograph techniques to measure wave-lengths
  accurately. They develop a method for calculating wave-lengths and discuss the accuracy
  of their results, finding that the emanation spectrum is distinct from previous
  measurements.
