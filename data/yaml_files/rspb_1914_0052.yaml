  Species and Infection Rates'

scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: This study investigates the infectivity of Glossina morsitans in Nyasaland during
  1912 and 1913, focusing on the prevalence of trypanosome species and their infection
  rates in tsetse flies. The researchers found that 53% of flies were infected with
  trypanosomes, with T. brucei being the most common species. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding the factors that influence infectivity for future
  research and disease control efforts.
