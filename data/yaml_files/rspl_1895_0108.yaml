tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature variations on the accuracy
  of Clark cells as a standard of electromotive force. The authors conducted experiments
  to determine the temperature coefficient and the degree of accuracy of temperature
  coefficients during continuous temperature changes. They found that cells responded
  readily to temperature changes, but there was a lag in the response, and the accuracy
  of the temperature coefficient was affected by the rate of temperature change.
