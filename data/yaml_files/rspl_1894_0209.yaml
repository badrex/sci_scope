  Disease
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Science & Botany
tldr: The author investigates the impact of lime and acid bone manure on the development
  of a cabbage disease caused by Plasmodiophora. The study demonstrates that the presence
  of lime can prevent the disease, while acid bone manure promotes its growth. The
  findings suggest that soil sterilization with lime or potash-containing manure can
  effectively control the disease.
