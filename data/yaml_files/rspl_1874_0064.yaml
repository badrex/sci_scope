revised_title: Effects of Stress on Magnetization in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This article investigates the effects of stress on the magnetization of metals,
  specifically steel and soft-iron wires. The author finds that hanging weights on
  the wires decreases their magnetization, while taking the weights off increases
  it. The study also reveals differences in the magnetic behavior of steel and soft-iron
  wires under stress.
