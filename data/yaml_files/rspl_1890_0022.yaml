revised_title: Investigating Motor Cortex and Internal Capsule Excitation in an Orangutan
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the representation of motor functions in the cortex
  of an orangutan, finding specialized areas for different body parts and a high degree
  of differentiation in the cortex. They also study the effects of electrical stimulation
  on the internal capsule, confirming previous findings and mapping the critical areas.
