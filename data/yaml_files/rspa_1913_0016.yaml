revised_title: A Simplified Approach to Integration Theory
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a new approach to integration theory using monotone sequences
  and upper and lower semi-continuous functions, simplifying the process and generalizing
  it to unbounded functions.
topics:
- Integration Theory
- Monotone Sequences
- Upper and Lower Semi-Continuous Functions
- Darboux's Theory
- Lebesgue Integration
