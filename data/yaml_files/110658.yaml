tldr: The author examines the nerves of the gravid uterus and discovers the presence
  of fasciculated bands on the anterior and posterior surfaces, resembling ganglionic
  plexuses of nerves. These bands are found to be closely connected with the hypogastric
  and spermatic nerves, raising questions about their nature and function.
