revised_title: Pharmacological Analysis of Pyraconitine and Methylbenzaconine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Drug Discovery
tldr: The authors investigate the pharmacological effects and toxicity of pyraconitine
  and methylbenzaconine, two derivatives of aconitine. They find that both compounds
  have reduced toxicity compared to aconitine, with pyraconitine being more toxic
  than methylbenzaconine. The study also reveals differences in their physiological
  actions, with pyraconitine causing more rapid effects, while methylbenzaconine has
  a weaker and shorter duration of action.
