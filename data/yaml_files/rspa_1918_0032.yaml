revised_title: Investigation of the Ultra-Violet Band of Ammonia in the Solar Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the ultra-violet band of ammonia and its presence in
  the solar spectrum. They analyze the band's structure and compare it with the solar
  spectrum, finding a strong correspondence between the two. The study provides evidence
  that many of the fainter solar lines are due to ammonia, confirming its presence
  in the sun's atmosphere.
