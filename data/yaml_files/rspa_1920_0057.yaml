revised_title: Improvements in Vacuum Grating Spectroscopy
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author describes the redesign and improvements made to a vacuum grating
  spectrograph, allowing for better removal of exuded gases, easier adjustments, and
  the use of larger gratings. The new design enables the study of absorption spectra
  of elements using helium as a medium.
