scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Captain W. de W. Abney investigates the wave-lengths of A, a, and prominent
  lines in the infra-red of the solar spectrum using concave gratings and compares
  his findings with existing maps by Fievez, Cornu, and Angstrom. He provides accurate
  measurements of several lines in the infra-red spectrum and discusses the methods
  used for determining the wave-lengths.
