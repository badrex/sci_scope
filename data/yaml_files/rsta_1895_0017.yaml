revised_title: Stability and Periods of an Electrified Hollow Vortex Ring
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics
tldr: The authors investigate the stability and periods of an electrified hollow vortex
  ring, finding that it is stable for most displacements of its surface, with the
  exception of sinuous vibrations of slow type. They also explore the effects of electric
  charge on the vortex's motion and energy.
