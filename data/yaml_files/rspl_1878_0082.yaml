scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines the skeletal structures of Polyodon folium, a generalized
  member of the Ganoids, and compares it with other related genera. The study reveals
  a remarkable combination of structures usually distinctive of the Plagiostome Elasmobranchii,
  suggesting a close relationship between Polyodon and Acipenser. The author also
  discusses the phylogenetic relationships of the Ganoids, Amphibia, and Elasmobranchs
  based on the structural features common to these primary groups.
