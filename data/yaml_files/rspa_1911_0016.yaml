tldr: The author investigates the properties and convergence of Fourier series coefficients
  for various types of functions, including those of bounded variation, summable functions,
  and functions with Harnack-Lebesgue integrals. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of Fourier series and their applications in mathematical analysis.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Mathematical analysis
- Lebesgue integration
- Function theory
- Series convergence
