revised_title: A Simplified Method for Obtaining Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: Smithson Tennant describes a new, simplified method for obtaining potassium
  using iron and potash. The process involves distilling the two substances in a gun
  barrel, allowing the potassium to sublime into a narrow tube. This method is more
  accessible and efficient than previous methods, as it does not require a specialized
  furnace or precise barrel fitting.
