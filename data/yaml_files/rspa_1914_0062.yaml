revised_title: The Disturbance of the Equilibrium in Solutions by 'Strong' and 'Weak'
  Interfering Agents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the disturbance of equilibrium in sugar solutions caused
  by various interfering agents, such as salts, alcohols, and other substances. They
  find that these agents affect the proportions of the two isodynamic forms of the
  sugar in equilibrium, with some promoting the formation of fructodextrose and others
  promoting fructolaevose.
