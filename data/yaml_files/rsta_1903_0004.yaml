  Spherical Harmonics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author presents a new method for reducing a function of spherical co-ordinates
  to a series of spherical harmonics, focusing on definite integrals and tesseral
  functions. This method simplifies the arithmetical labor involved and allows for
  the independent determination of coefficients for lower degrees, making it more
  efficient for numerical calculations.
topics:
- Spherical harmonics
- Tesseral functions
- Definite integrals
- Angular variables
- Zonal harmonics
