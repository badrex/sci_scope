revised_title: Dielectric Constants of Certain Organic Bodies at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the dielectric constants of various organic compounds
  at and below the temperature of liquid air, finding that these compounds have high
  dielectric values at normal temperatures but experience a reduction in dielectric
  power when frozen and cooled to low temperatures.
topics:
- Dielectric constants
- Low temperatures
- Organic compounds
- Physical chemistry
- Electrical properties
