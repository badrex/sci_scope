revised_title: Investigation of Metal Fatigue and Fracture under Repeated Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the process of metal fatigue and fracture in iron under
  repeated stress reversals. They observe the formation of slip-bands and cracks in
  the material under stress, eventually leading to fracture. The study demonstrates
  that even stresses below the elastic limit can cause damage over time, with stresses
  of 7-9 tons per square inch being sufficient to develop cracks and cause failure
  in Swedish iron.
