revised_title: Extension of Arbogast's Method of Derivations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Algebra
tldr: The author extends Arbogast's method of derivations to develop a rule for forming
  combinations of a given degree and weight in letters (a, b, c, d,...). This rule
  operates simultaneously on certain pairs of letters, providing a more efficient
  process for finding specific columns of coefficients.
