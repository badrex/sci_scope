revised_title: 'Liquefaction and Solidification of Gases: Faraday''s Experiments and
  Findings'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Michael Faraday's experiments demonstrate the liquefaction and solidification
  of various gases using mechanical compression and extreme temperature depressions.
  He successfully condensed gases like chlorine, cyanogen, ammonia, and others into
  liquids, while others, like hydrogen and oxygen, remained unaffected by the conditions.
