revised_title: Algebraic and Transcendental Approaches to Elliptic Functions Transformation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This article by Professor Cayley discusses the transformation of elliptic functions,
  focusing on the algebraic and transcendental approaches. It covers the general case
  of elliptic functions transformation and provides a detailed analysis of specific
  cases, such as n=7 and n=11. The author also reproduces Sohnke's modular equations
  and presents additional tabular results to aid in the understanding of the theory.
