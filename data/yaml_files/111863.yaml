revised_title: On the Equation for the Product of the Differences of All but One of
  the Roots of a Given Equation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: Arthur Cayley investigates the equation for the product of the differences of
  all but one root of a given equation. He determines the equation for equations of
  orders three, four, and five, using methods of symmetric functions and covariants.
  This solution also leads to a more general question involving covariants of the
  quantic.
