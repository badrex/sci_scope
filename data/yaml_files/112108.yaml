revised_title: Chemical Composition of Fluid in Nematode Entozoa and Its Relation
  to Animal Nutrition
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Zoology
tldr: The author analyzes the fluid from the peritoneal cavity of the nematode Entozoa
  and finds that its composition is similar to the juice of flesh in higher animals.
  This suggests that the process of assimilation in these worms is similar to that
  in animals with well-developed digestive and circulatory systems. The fluid contains
  a large quantity of albumen, phosphate of potash, and a small amount of fat, indicating
  that nutrition in nematode worms can be carried out by a fluid with few other substances.
