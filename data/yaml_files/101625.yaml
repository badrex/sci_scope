revised_title: Inquiry into Acid Liquor and Bleeding of Sycamore Trees
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates the acid secretion of insects and the bleeding of sycamore
  trees, providing observations and questions about the nature of plant juices and
  their movement. He suggests that the bleeding may be a result of altered sap temperature
  and consistency, and proposes further inquiries into the conditions that cause trees
  to bleed or not.
