tldr: The author examines the chemical composition of Rubia munjista, the East-Indian
  Madder, and its dye properties. The study reveals that munjistine and purpurine
  are the main colorants in munjeet, which have lower tinctorial power compared to
  the best madder. Additionally, a new colorant called purpureine is discovered, which
  has unique properties and is similar to orcein.
