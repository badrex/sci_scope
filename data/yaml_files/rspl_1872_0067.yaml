revised_title: Investigating the Heat Required to Kill Bacteria and the Causes of
  Putrefaction and Fermentation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Pathology
tldr: The author examines the temperature at which bacteria and their supposed germs
  are killed when exposed to heat in a moist state and investigates the causes of
  putrefaction and fermentation. The study reveals that a heat of 140°F (60°C) is
  often sufficient to kill bacteria, while a higher heat is necessary to prevent putrefaction
  in organic infusions. The author suggests that the delayed putrefaction may be due
  to the influence of the non-living organic matter in the inoculating compound.
