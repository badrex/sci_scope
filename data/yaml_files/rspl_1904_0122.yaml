tldr: The author analyzes the Falmouth magnetograms from 1891 to 1902, comparing the
  results with Kew data. The study reveals a close agreement between the two stations
  in terms of non-cyclic effects, annual variations, and diurnal inequalities. The
  findings emphasize the importance of using contemporaneous data when comparing two
  stations.
