scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of choline in the blood and cerebrospinal
  fluid of patients with various nervous system diseases, including General Paralysis
  of the Insane, Combined Sclerosis, Disseminated Sclerosis, and Alcoholic Neuritis.
  They use chemical and physiological tests to detect choline and analyze its role
  in nerve degeneration.
