scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathology
tldr: The author investigates the nature of acid and saline matters in animal stomachs
  and concludes that the acid present is muriatic acid, while the salts are alkaline
  muriates. The findings have implications for understanding the physiology and pathology
  of the digestive process and other animal functions.
