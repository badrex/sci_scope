scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering & Instrumentation
tldr: The author invents and calibrates a single-lens micrometer, an instrument that
  measures small objects with greater accuracy than previous tools. The micrometer
  uses a small lens, a scale of fine wires, and a system of adjustments to provide
  precise measurements. The author also discusses the process of calibrating the instrument
  and the accuracy of its measurements compared to other instruments.
