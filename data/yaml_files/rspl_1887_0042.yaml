revised_title: 'Magnetization of Iron in Strong Fields: Experimental Techniques and
  Observations'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetization of iron in strong fields using an
  electromagnet and various test pieces. They find that wrought iron samples, such
  as Swedish iron and Lowmoor iron, are more susceptible to magnetization than soft
  hammered scrap iron. The experiments reveal that iron can take on higher levels
  of magnetization than previously observed in similar experiments, suggesting a need
  for further investigation into the molecular theory of magnetization.
