tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of various elements and compounds when introduced
  into glowing nitrogen, observing changes in the intensity and appearance of spectral
  lines. They also study the effects of introducing different substances into the
  nitrogen afterglow, such as nitric oxide and metallic elements like sodium, potassium,
  and mercury.
