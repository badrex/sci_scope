revised_title: The Action of Magnetised Electrodes on Electrical Discharge Phenomena
  in Rarefied Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetised electrodes on electrical discharge
  phenomena in rarefied gases, observing the formation of a luminous ring that rotates
  around the magnetic axis. The study suggests that the ring consists of negative
  ions streaming towards the strongest part of the magnetic field and that the luminosity
  is mainly due to incoming radial streams of positive ions.
