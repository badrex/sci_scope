revised_title: Investigating the Permanency of Mean Water and Low Water Laws at Plymouth
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author, W. Whewell, investigates the permanency of mean water and low water
  laws at Plymouth using a six-year observation period. The results show that the
  height of mean water is constant within two or three inches from year to year, with
  a semi-menstrual inequality of six or seven inches for each fortnight. The study
  also reveals the influence of lunar declination on mean water height and confirms
  the theoretical deduction that low and high water heights are affected by the moon's
  declination.
