scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The author presents a study on symmetrisable functions and their expansion in
  terms of biorthogonal functions, providing a generalization of the expansion theorem
  for functions of positive type. The study focuses on the properties of kernels that
  are completely symmetrisable on the left and the application of biorthogonal systems
  of functions to the theory of integral equations.
topics:
- Symmetrisable Functions
- Biorthogonal Functions
- Integral Equations
