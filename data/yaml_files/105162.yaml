tldr: William Shervington observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun on May 6, 1753,
  in Antigua. Using a Graham's watch and an exquisite quadrant, he determined the
  time of Mercury's exit and the distance of the Sun's upper limb from the zenith.
  His observation, compared with that made by Mr. Short, helped fix the longitude
  of the observation site in Antigua.
