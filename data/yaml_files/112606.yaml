revised_title: Spectrum Analysis of a New Star in Corona Borealis
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The authors observe a new star in Corona Borealis and analyze its spectrum using
  a spectroscope. They discover that the star's light is composed of two different
  sources, one similar to the sun's spectrum and the other consisting of bright lines
  indicating luminous gas. The researchers speculate that hydrogen may play a significant
  role in the differences of physical constitution among stars and their changes.
