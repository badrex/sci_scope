revised_title: Further Observations on the Distribution of Nerves in Striped Muscle
  Fibers
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of nerves in striped muscle fibers,
  particularly in frogs, and concludes that nerves do not terminate in free ends but
  rather form complex networks throughout the fibers. This research challenges previous
  beliefs about the limited supply and distribution of nerves to muscles.
