scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The study investigates the decussating tracts and pyramidal system in the mid-
  and inter-brain, focusing on the effects of hemisections of the mesencephalon and
  the degeneration of Meynert's commissure and Forel's decussation. The research provides
  insights into the connections and functions of various tracts and their roles in
  the brain's structure and function.
