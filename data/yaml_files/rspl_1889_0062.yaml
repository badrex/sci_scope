tldr: This study investigates the arrangement of excitable fibers in the internal
  capsule of bonnet monkeys, providing insights into the relationship between the
  fibers and the basal ganglia. The research also examines the lateral arrangement,
  antero-posterior order, and the average localization of each segment, contributing
  to the understanding of the nervous system's organization.
