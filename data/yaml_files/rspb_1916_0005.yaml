scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: The author investigates the process of gametogenesis and sex-determination in
  the gall-fly Neuroterus lenticularis. By examining the offspring of individual sexual
  females, the author discovers that the majority of flies in each family are of one
  sex, proving that the difference between male-producing and female-producing females
  of the agamic generation does not depend on two kinds of spermatozoa.
