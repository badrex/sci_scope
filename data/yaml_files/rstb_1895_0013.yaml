revised_title: The Influence of Environmental Factors on Echinoderm Larval Development
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the impact of various environmental factors, such as
  temperature, season, and salinity, on the development of echinoderm larvae, specifically
  the sea urchin Strogylocentrotus lividus. The research focuses on understanding
  how external conditions can affect growth and development, apart from intrinsic
  differences in the germ.
