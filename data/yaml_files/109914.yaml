  Reach
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geometric Measurements
tldr: Sir William Herschel presents a method to determine the relative distances of
  star clusters and investigates the power of telescopes to reach into space. He uses
  his observations to represent the profundity of celestial objects in space and discusses
  the limitations of telescopic power.
