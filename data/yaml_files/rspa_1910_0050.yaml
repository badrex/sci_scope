revised_title: Investigating Viscous Flow in Metals and Allied Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the viscous flow in metals, particularly lead and fuse
  wire, using a hyperbolic weight to maintain constant stress. The study reveals that
  under constant stress, the rate of flow per unit length remains constant throughout
  the extension process. The author also explores the flow in copper and discusses
  the differences in behavior between metals.
