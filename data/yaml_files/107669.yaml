revised_title: A Comparative Study of the Rhinoceros Skulls from Africa and Siberia
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Paleontology
tldr: The author examines the skull of a new species of rhinoceros found in Africa
  and compares it to a fossilized skull from Siberia. The skulls share striking similarities,
  suggesting that the species may not be entirely extinct and that large animals from
  past ages could still exist in unexplored regions.
