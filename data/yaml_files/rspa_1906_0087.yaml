revised_title: 'The Refractive Indices of Water and Sea-water: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: This study investigates the refractive indices of water and sea-water, comparing
  their properties and how they change with temperature and wavelength. The research
  provides accurate indices to the fourth decimal place, with an estimated error not
  exceeding 0.000025.
topics:
- Refractive Indices
- Water Properties
- Sea-water Properties
- Optical Physics
- Temperature Refraction Coefficients
