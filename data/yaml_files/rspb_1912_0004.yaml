revised_title: Cholesterol Content in Rabbits' Livers Under Various Diets and Inanition
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: This study investigates the cholesterol content in the livers of rabbits fed
  on different diets and during inanition. The results show that the liver's cholesterol
  content varies depending on the diet, supporting the hypothesis that cholesterol
  is a vital component in the formation of new cells and is not excreted as a waste
  product.
