revised_title: On the Electrical Conductivity of Air and Salt Vapours
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity of air and salt vapours,
  focusing on the effect of temperature on conductivity and the maximum current a
  salt vapour can carry. They also discuss the ionization process and compare their
  findings with previous research on flame conductivity.
