  Bodies
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectrum Analysis & Astrophysics
tldr: Frankland and Lockyer present further research on gaseous spectra and their
  relation to the physical constitution of celestial bodies, such as the Sun, stars,
  and nebulae. They discuss the temperature and pressure conditions that affect the
  spectra of hydrogen and nitrogen gases, and how these findings can contribute to
  our understanding of celestial bodies.
