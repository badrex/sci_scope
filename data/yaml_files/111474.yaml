revised_title: 'Conducting Power of Metals and Alloys: A Study on Heat Conductivity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The authors, F. Crace Calvert and Richard Johnson, investigate the relative
  power of metals and their alloys to conduct heat. They determine the conducting
  powers of various metals and alloys, and discuss the influence of impurities and
  crystallization on conductibility. They also study the effect of combining metals
  and non-metallic substances, and classify alloys into three categories based on
  their heat-conducting properties.
topics:
- Heat Conduction
- Metals
- Alloys
- Impurities
- Crystallization
