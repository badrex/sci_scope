tldr: S. C. Homersham's study of rainfall patterns in hilly districts of Lancashire,
  Cheshire, and Derbyshire reveals that more rain falls at the bottoms of hills than
  at the tops, with the quantity decreasing as altitude increases. This conclusion
  contrasts with previous findings by J. Miller and is supported by the author's own
  observations and those of other notable scientists.
