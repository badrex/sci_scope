tldr: The author, H. C. Sorby, discovers a new elementary substance, Jargonium, associated
  with Zirconium. Jargonium exhibits unique properties and can exist in three different
  crystalline states, each producing distinct spectra. The author also discusses the
  separation of Jargonium from Zirconia and its potential applications in understanding
  the formation of rocks and minerals.
