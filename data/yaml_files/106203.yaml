revised_title: Effects of Lightning on a House with a Pointed Conductor
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author describes a case where a house with a pointed conductor was struck
  by lightning despite the conductor's purpose to prevent such accidents. The study
  suggests that the conductor's design and placement may not be sufficient to protect
  the entire building, and that multiple conductors with connections between them
  could provide better protection.
