revised_title: Elasticity of the Living Brain and Recovery after Compression
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The study investigates the elasticity of the living brain and the factors affecting
  its recovery after compression. It concludes that the elasticity of the brain is
  not directly proportional to blood pressure and that venous pressure has a more
  significant impact on cerebral circulation than arterial pressure.
