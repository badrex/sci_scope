revised_title: Magnetization of Iron and Other Magnetic Metals in Strong Fields
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetization of iron, nickel, cobalt, and various
  steels in strong magnetic fields using a large electromagnet. They find that the
  intensity of magnetism in wrought iron remains constant at around 1700 c.g.s. units,
  while other metals exhibit varying saturation values. The study also reveals that
  Hadfield's manganese steel has a constant permeability of about 1 throughout the
  range of applied forces.
