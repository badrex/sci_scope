revised_title: 'Investigation of the Chemical Composition of Wax: Cerotic Acid'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical nature of wax, focusing on cerotic acid,
  a new acid found in beeswax. Through a series of experiments, he discovers that
  cerotic acid can be separated from other wax components and saponified with ease,
  suggesting that it is the primary component responsible for the wax's chemical properties.
