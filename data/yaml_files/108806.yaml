scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates skew surfaces generated by lines meeting given curves,
  expanding the theory of skew surfaces and introducing new concepts such as lines
  through four points and nodal residues. The study covers various types of scrolls
  and their properties, providing a comprehensive table of results.
