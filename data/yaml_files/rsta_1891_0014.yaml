revised_title: Determination of Earth's Mean Density and Gravitation Constant Using
  a Common Balance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Gravitation
tldr: The author describes a method to determine the mean density of the Earth and
  the gravitational constant using a common balance. The experiment involves measuring
  the tilting of the balance beam due to the attraction between the masses and the
  Earth, and then calculating the density and constant based on the observed effects.
