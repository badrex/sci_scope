tldr: The author investigates the development of marsupial and tubular enamels and
  proposes a unifying theory of enamel formation. The study reveals that the special
  cells of the enamel organ (Ameloblasts) do not calcify and that they each furnish
  outgrowths that form the enamel prism. The calcification process occurs centripetally,
  creating axial canals in the enamel, which supports the theory that all enamels,
  including tubular enamels, are formed through a similar process.
