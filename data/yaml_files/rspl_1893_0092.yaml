revised_title: A New Approach to the Electric and Luminiferous Medium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author proposes a new theory of the electric and luminiferous medium, suggesting
  that the aether is a structureless, frictionless fluid with rotational elasticity.
  This theory aims to explain the transmission of radiation, including light and heat,
  through the aether, and to unify the diverse properties of the medium.
