revised_title: Cortical Centres and Movements of the Upper Limb in Monkeys
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: Beevor and Horsley investigate the cortical centres responsible for upper limb
  movements in monkeys, analyzing the topographical anatomy and the sequence and quality
  of movements produced by stimulating different regions of the cortex. They propose
  two axioms regarding the organization of the motor area and discuss the localisation
  of sequence and quality of movements.

- Neuroanatomy
- Motor Cortex
- Cortical Mapping
- Upper Limb Movements
- Localisation of Function
