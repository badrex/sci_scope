scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: This study investigates the enzymes of B. Coli communis involved in glucose
  and mannitol decomposition, focusing on the fermentation of glucose in the presence
  of formic acid. The results show that formic acid and its gaseous products must
  be separated from other fermentation products, and the addition of formic acid can
  alter the balance of fermentation products, providing insight into the complex interactions
  of bacterial enzymes and their metabolic pathways.
