revised_title: Investigating the Electrification Produced During the Raising of a
  Dust Cloud
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The authors investigate the electrification produced when raising a dust cloud
  and find that the charge is actually produced on the dust cloud itself. They also
  discover that the nature of the surface from which the dust is blown has no influence
  on the charge acquired, and that the charge on the air appears to be accompanied
  by an opposite charge.
