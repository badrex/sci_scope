revised_title: Inorganic Colloids and the Mimicry of Living Organisms
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Colloid & Surface Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the slow growths in metastable solutions of inorganic
  colloids and observe forms resembling living organisms. They discuss the potential
  implications for understanding the origin of life and the morphology of microscopic
  life forms.
topics:
- Colloids
- Metastable Solutions
- Growth Forms
- Biological Mimicry
- Osmotic Pressure
