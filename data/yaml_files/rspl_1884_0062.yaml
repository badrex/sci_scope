  on Magnetic Susceptibility and Retentiveness'

tldr: This paper presents a series of experiments on the magnetic susceptibility and
  retentiveness of iron and steel under various conditions, such as cyclic changes
  of magnetizing force, stress, and temperature. The author investigates the effects
  of hysteresis, the influence of stress on magnetic properties, and the relationship
  between magnetism and temperature. The results show that the energy expended in
  performing cyclic changes of magnetization is relatively small, and that the principal
  part of the heat produced in electromagnets' cores is due to other factors, such
  as the induction of Foucault currents.
