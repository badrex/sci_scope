tldr: A man and woman's bodies, lost in a snowstorm and buried in Derbyshire moors,
  were discovered 49 years later in an astonishingly well-preserved state. The unique
  properties of the peat moss allowed their skin and flesh to remain soft and intact,
  providing a rare opportunity for scientific observation and study.
