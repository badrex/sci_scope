scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the properties of hyperjacobian surfaces and curves,
  extending previous work on jacobian surfaces and curves. The study focuses on the
  contact points between surfaces and the properties of the hyperjacobian curve, including
  cases of two-branch and three-branch contact with different types of pencils.
