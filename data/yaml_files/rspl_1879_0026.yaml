  in Microscopic Imaging'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Cell Biology
tldr: The author discusses the challenges faced in microscopic research, such as overlapping
  images, residual aberrations, and diffraction effects. He presents a new method
  for estimating small magnitudes and introduces a new test for microscopes, which
  displays bright and sharp black lines. The paper also explores the use of various
  immersion fluids and offers solutions for achieving high-definition images in challenging
  cases.
topics:
- Microscopy
- Optical Aberrations
- Diffraction
- Microscope Objectives
