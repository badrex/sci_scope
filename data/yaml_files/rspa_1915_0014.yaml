revised_title: 'The Origin of the Indo-Gangetic Trough: A Tension-Based Hypothesis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author proposes a tension-based hypothesis for the formation of the Indo-Gangetic
  trough, challenging the existing theories of depression and compression. He suggests
  that the trough was created by the opening of the Earth's crust under tension, rather
  than sinking under its own weight or being compressed by horizontal forces.
