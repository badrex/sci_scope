scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Captain Abney presents a method for mapping the least refrangible end of the
  solar spectrum using photographic techniques. He describes the sensitiveness of
  silver salts and the apparatus used for photography. He shares a map of the solar
  spectrum from 7600 to 10750 and compares it with other methods.
