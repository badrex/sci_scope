tldr: Monsieur Auzout predicts the motion of the second comet and shares his ephemerides
  with the Royal Society. He observes the comet's slow movement, its brightness, and
  its train's splendor. Auzout hopes that his predictions will help verify his method
  for various types of comets and contribute to the understanding of celestial mechanics
  and the Earth's motion.
