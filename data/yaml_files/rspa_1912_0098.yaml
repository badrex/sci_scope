revised_title: Spectro-Photometric Comparison of Gold's Emissivity in Solid and Liquid
  States at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the emissivity of solid and liquid gold at high temperatures
  using spectro-photometry. They compare the results with a black body radiator and
  find that gold's emissivity changes with its physical state, but not significantly
  enough to affect its electrical conductivity or optical constants.
