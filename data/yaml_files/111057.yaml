revised_title: Ammonia's Molecular Constitution in Volatile Organic Bases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Dr. A.W. Hofmann's research investigates the molecular constitution of volatile
  organic bases, specifically the relationship between ammonia and vegetable alkaloids.
  He disproves Berzelius's theory and expands on Liebig's view, proposing that ammonia
  can lose 1, 2, or 3 equivalents of hydrogen, replaced by various compound radicals,
  creating an endless variety of substances with a basic character. Hofmann also demonstrates
  this through the artificial construction of thirteen new organic alkaloids.
