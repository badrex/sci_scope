revised_title: An Investigation into Fluid Friction and the Discharge of Fluids
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: George Rennie investigates the relationship between the quantities of water
  discharged through orifices and tubes and the retardations caused by fluid friction.
  He finds that the resistance experienced by solids and fluids is not well understood
  and conducts experiments to measure the retardations experienced by solids moving
  in fluids and fluids moving over solids. Rennie concludes that the resistance is
  related to the area of the orifice and the square root of the height, and that the
  resistance in pipes is not proportional to the angle of the bend.
