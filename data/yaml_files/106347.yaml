scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: Dr. Musgrave disagrees with the committee's report on Mr. Wilson's electrical
  experiments and Mr. Nairne's demonstrations. He argues that sharp points can still
  receive electrical explosions even when they have perfect communication with the
  ground, and that the difference between sharp and blunt conductors lies in the quantity
  of electric fluid accumulated.
