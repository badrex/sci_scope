revised_title: The Contraction of Planetary Orbits and the Acceleration of Earth's
  Rotation
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics
tldr: Professor Euler discusses the contraction of planetary orbits and the acceleration
  of Earth's rotation. He argues that ancient observations may not be accurate due
  to calendar discrepancies and questions the assumption that days and gravity have
  always been constant. Euler suggests that the Earth's rotation around its axis may
  be becoming more rapid, and that the force of Jupiter may be responsible for this
  acceleration.
