  Actions and the Magnetic Condition of All Matter'

scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: In this series of experiments, Faraday investigates the magnetic actions and
  properties of various materials, including heavy glass and other substances, when
  exposed to magnetic and electric forces. He discovers that these materials can be
  influenced by magnets and can take up positions perpendicular to the lines of magnetic
  force, providing a means to study and understand magnetic phenomena and potentially
  develop a theory of general magnetic action.
