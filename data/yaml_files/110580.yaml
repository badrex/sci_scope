revised_title: Investigating the Distribution and Nature of Voltaic Force in Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: John Frederic Daniell investigates the distribution and nature of voltaic force
  in electrolytes using various experiments. He concludes that the force emanating
  from the active zinc center diffuses over the entire conducting sphere and follows
  the inverse square law of radiant forces. Daniell also explores the effects of different
  generating and conducting surfaces and their distances on the force's energy and
  circulation.
