revised_title: Investigating the Evaporation of Water and its Relation to Environmental
  Factors

scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Edm. Halley conducts experiments to measure the evaporation of water in Gresham
  College and observes the effects of various environmental factors on the evaporation
  rate. He finds that the sun and wind play a significant role in the evaporation
  process, and that the depth of water evaporated in a year is much less than previous
  experiments had suggested. Additionally, Halley discovers that the refraction of
  water vapors can cause strange optical illusions, such as objects appearing raised
  or overhanging.
