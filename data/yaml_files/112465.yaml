revised_title: Chemical Constitution of Narcotine and Its Products of Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical reactions and properties of narcotine and
  its products of decomposition, including opianic acid, meconin, and hemipinic acid.
  They discover new acids, such as methyl nor-opianic acid, methyl nor-meconic acid,
  and methyl-hypogallic acid, and describe the formation of a new base, methyl-nor-narcotine.
