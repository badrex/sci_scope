tldr: The author, J.W. Mallet, provides a detailed analysis of historical experiments
  and methods used to determine the atomic weight of gold. He discusses the limitations
  and potential sources of error in previous experiments, such as those conducted
  by Berzelius and Levol, and presents his own findings based on a thorough examination
  of gold compounds and their atomic weights.
