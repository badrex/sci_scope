scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author extends Gauss's investigations on real quadratic forms to complex
  binary quadratic forms, defining the genera, discussing the theory of composition,
  determining the number of ambiguous classes, and exploring the representation of
  forms of the principal genus by ternary quadratic forms of determinant 1.
