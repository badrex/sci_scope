revised_title: Experiments on the Discharge of Electricity through Gases and a Sketch
  of a Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The author presents experiments on the discharge of electricity through gases,
  specifically mercury vapor, and proposes a theory that the passage of electricity
  through gases involves the breaking up of molecules and the formation of unstable
  compounds like ozone.
