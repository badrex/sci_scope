revised_title: Challenging the Hadley Theory of Winds
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author, Thomas Hopkins, critiques the Hadley theory of winds, arguing that
  it is not supported by factual evidence. He posits that solar heating expands gases
  without causing them to rise and overflow, maintaining atmospheric equilibrium.
  Hopkins suggests that disturbances in the atmosphere are caused by heat released
  from condensed vapor, creating ascending currents and horizontal winds.
