revised_title: Investigating the Intensity Distribution in the Spectra of Hydrogen
  and Helium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors develop methods to accurately determine the photographic intensities
  of spectrum lines and reduce them to absolute values. They apply these methods to
  study the relative intensity distribution in the spectra of helium and hydrogen
  under different conditions of excitation. They find that under certain conditions,
  energy is transferred from longer to shorter wavelengths, enhancing the associated
  series at the expense of the principal series. They also study the separations of
  components of lines in the Balmer series of hydrogen and find that these values
  are consistent with a principal series.
