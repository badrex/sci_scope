revised_title: Magnetic Declination Variations at Different Periods of the Day
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: Lieut.-Col. Sabine investigates the annual variation of magnetic declination
  at different periods of the day at four colonial observatories. He finds that the
  range of variation is greater during the day than at night, and that there is a
  systematic pattern in the variation of the magnetic declination throughout the day.
  The study highlights the importance of considering both the time of day and the
  time of year when making observations and drawing inferences about magnetic changes.
