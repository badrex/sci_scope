revised_title: Experiments on Conductive Properties of Ice in Discovery Bay
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryosphere
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the rate of heat conduction through
  sea and fresh-water ice using a specially designed apparatus. The results provide
  a rough method for estimating the absolute rate of conduction and contribute to
  the understanding of ice's conductive properties.
topics:
- Ice Conductivity
- Heat Transfer
- Thermal Insulation
- Temperature Measurement
