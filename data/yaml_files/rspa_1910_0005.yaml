revised_title: Investigating the Distribution of X-Rays from a Focus Bulb
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors study the distribution of X-rays from a focus bulb, finding that
  the intensity varies depending on the angle of incidence. They also discuss the
  effects of tube hardness and the potential for specular reflection of cathode rays
  on X-ray generation.
