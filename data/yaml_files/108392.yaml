scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author compares Glaisher's hygrometrical tables with Daniell's hygrometer
  and finds them to be accurate, providing a reliable method for determining the dew-point
  temperature. The author also discusses the limitations of using ether in Daniell's
  hygrometer and suggests improvements for more accurate readings.
