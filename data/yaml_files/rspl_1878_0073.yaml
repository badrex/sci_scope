  Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author develops a method to determine the specific gravity of high-boiling-point
  substances, such as thallium chloride and lead chloride, by vaporizing them in porcelain
  globes and analyzing the residue. The method allows for accurate determination of
  molecular weights and can be used to study various compounds and elements.
