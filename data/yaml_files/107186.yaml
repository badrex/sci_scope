scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical properties of guaiacum, a resinous substance,
  and discovers its unique characteristics, such as the presence of vegetable extract,
  rapid dissolution in nitric acid, and the production of oxalic acid. Guaiacum is
  found to be different from other resins, balsams, gum resins, gums, and extracts
  due to its distinct chemical composition and properties.
