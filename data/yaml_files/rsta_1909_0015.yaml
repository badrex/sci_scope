revised_title: Investigating the Electricity of Rain and its Origin in Thunderstorms
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The authors investigate the origin of electricity in thunderstorms by measuring
  the electricity brought down by rain and conducting laboratory experiments. They
  developed a new theory that explains the electrical effects observed during thunderstorms,
  including the potential gradient and the role of atmospheric conditions.
