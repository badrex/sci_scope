revised_title: A New Property of Tangents in Trisecting a Circle's Circumference
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Trigonometry
tldr: The author demonstrates a new property relating to the tangents of three arches
  that trisect a circle's circumference. The square of the radius multiplied by the
  sum of the tangents of the three arches is equal to the product of the tangents
  themselves.
