tldr: The author describes the Aurora Borealis observed on November 17, 1848, and
  its subsequent meteorological effects. The phenomenon began with lambent strokes
  of shining, filmy matter in the northeast and northwest, eventually forming a crimson
  and purple arch spanning the sky. The event concluded with a series of showers,
  supporting the author's theory that meteoric coruscations and iridescences in the
  sky are followed by precipitation.
