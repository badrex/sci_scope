revised_title: The Effect of Temperature on the Elimination of Extraneous Bacteria
  in Chloroformed Calf Vaccine
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The author investigates the impact of temperature on the elimination of extraneous
  bacteria in chloroformed calf vaccines and finds that the process is most effective
  at temperatures between 18°C and 23°C. The study also shows that vaccines treated
  with the chloroform process maintain their potency over time when stored under suitable
  conditions.
