tldr: The authors conducted a long-term experiment on the effects of different manures
  on the mixed herbage of permanent meadow, observing significant variations in agricultural,
  botanical, and chemical results. They found that manures affected the growth and
  composition of the herbage, with some manures promoting grasses and others favoring
  leguminous species. The study highlights the complexity of grassland ecosystems
  and the potential for manure to influence plant growth and soil composition.
