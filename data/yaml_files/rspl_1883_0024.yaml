revised_title: Determination of the Atomic Weight of Glucinum (Beryllium) through
  Specific Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors determine the atomic weight of glucinum (beryllium) by measuring
  its specific heat. They prepare a pure sample of metallic glucinum and use a modified
  version of Regnault's method of mixtures to obtain accurate results. The atomic
  weight is found to be 13.65, which is the true value and not two-thirds of that,
  as previously thought.
