  for Mining Operations'

scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mining
tldr: This study investigates the temperature of strata in the Rose Bridge Colliery,
  reaching a depth of 808 yards, and finds that the temperature of the strata increases
  more rapidly than the open pit. The findings suggest that high temperatures and
  pressures at depth can affect mining operations, such as the Rose Bridge Colliery,
  which is one of the deepest in the world.
