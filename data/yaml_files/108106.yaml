revised_title: Investigating the Structure and Composition of Muscular Fibers in Animal
  and Organic Life
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure of muscular fibers in animal and organic life
  using a microscope and discovers the presence of distinct transverse striations,
  which are more visible in certain types of muscles. The striations are formed by
  the arrangement of fibers and filaments within the muscle, and their appearance
  can be affected by the preparation and manipulation of the sample.
