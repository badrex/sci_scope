scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: In this article, William Derham describes his experiments on the height of mercury
  in barometers at different heights, specifically at the top and bottom of a monument.
  He discusses the variations in mercury levels and provides a detailed account of
  his methods and observations, concluding that at every 82 feet height, the mercury
  will descend approximately 1/10 of an inch.
