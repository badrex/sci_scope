revised_title: The Influence of Pressure on the Volatilization Temperature of Solids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of pressure on the volatilization temperature
  of solids, specifically ice, and find that the temperature of a solid corresponding
  to a definite vapor tension is not necessarily identical to the temperature at which
  it volatilizes under the same pressure.
topics:
- Pressure and Temperature
- Volatilization
- Phase Transitions
- Ice and Water
- Chemical Equilibrium
