revised_title: The Chemistry and Function of Wing Pigments in Pierid Butterflies
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: This study investigates the chemistry of wing pigments in Pierid butterflies,
  revealing that the pigments are excretory substances. The yellow pigment found in
  most Pierid genera is a derivative of uric acid, and the white pigment in the white
  Pieridos contains uric acid as well. The pigments are used for ornamentation and
  are excreted by the butterflies as a normal byproduct.
