  Cases
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study examines nerve regeneration and secondary suture cases, exploring
  the histological changes that occur after nerve division and the possibility of
  nerve reunion by nerve substance. The author discusses various cases, microscopical
  examinations, and deductions from the results, ultimately concluding that nerves
  can regenerate and repair themselves through a combination of nerve substance and
  connective tissue.
