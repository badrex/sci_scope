revised_title: Investigating the Minute Structure of Striped Muscle through a New
  Method of Collodion Impressions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author examines the minute structure of striped muscle using a new method
  of investigation involving collodion impressions. They find that the cross-striping
  of muscle fibers is an optical expression of their varicose nature, and not due
  to internal structural differences.
