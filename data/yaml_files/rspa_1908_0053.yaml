revised_title: 'Helium and Radioactivity in Minerals: A Pioneering Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the presence of helium and argon in various minerals
  and finds that helium is a nearly universal constituent, while argon is present
  in smaller quantities. The study also suggests that the helium found in minerals
  is likely produced by radioactive changes within the elements themselves.
