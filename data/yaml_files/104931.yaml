revised_title: Experiments on Sensibility and Irritability in Animal Parts
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Physiology
tldr: Richard Brocklesby conducts experiments on the sensibility and irritability
  of various animal parts, such as skin, tendons, and muscles, and discusses his findings
  in relation to pain and sensation. He concludes that only nerves are sensible, while
  some parts are irritable without significant sensibility, and others are entirely
  insensible and unirritable.
