revised_title: Improving the Spectroscope for Enhanced Research
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Thomas Grubb proposes a simple and practical solution to improve the spectroscope,
  making the spectral lines appear straight in a larger field. This improvement enhances
  the instrument's ability to aid in research, particularly when using multiple prisms
  in serial combination.
