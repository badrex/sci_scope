revised_title: A New Class of Groups for the Uniformization of Algebraic Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The authors introduce a new class of projective substitution groups that can
  be used to uniformly represent algebraic functions of any genus on Riemann surfaces.
  This new class of groups is derived from substitutions of period two and can be
  applied to the uniformization of algebraic functions with a genus greater than unity.
