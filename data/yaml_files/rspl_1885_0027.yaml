revised_title: Investigating the Hydration of Ammonium Carbamate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author examines the hydration of ammonium carbamate, investigating the influence
  of time, mass, and temperature on the chemical reaction. The study reveals that
  the hydration is a function of the number of water molecules present and that the
  reaction becomes progressively slower, eventually reaching a limit short of complete
  hydration.
