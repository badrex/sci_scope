revised_title: Effects of Lesions on Different Regions of the Cerebral Hemispheres
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of lesions on different regions of the cerebral
  hemispheres in monkeys, focusing on the angular gyri and occipital lobes. They find
  that despite significant damage to the occipital lobe, vision remains unaffected,
  while damage to the prefrontal regions leads to a change in the animal's behavior
  and mental state.
