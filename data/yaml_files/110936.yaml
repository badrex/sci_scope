revised_title: The Dynamic Value of Compass Degrees and the Cause of the Magnetic
  Meridian Needle Resting
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the dynamic value of compass degrees and the cause of
  the magnetic needle resting in the magnetic meridian. He finds that the value of
  each compass degree is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from
  a bar magnet, and that the needle's resting position is due to an equilibrium between
  eastern and western repulsions.
