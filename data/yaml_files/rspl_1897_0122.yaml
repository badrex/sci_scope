revised_title: 'Development and Morphology of the Vascular System in Mammals: The
  Posterior End of the Aorta and the Iliac Arteries'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The authors investigate the development and morphology of the vascular system
  in mammals, focusing on the posterior end of the aorta and iliac arteries. They
  provide a detailed analysis of the primitive aorta's development and the formation
  of the common and internal iliac arteries, as well as the middle sacral artery.
  Their findings challenge the widely accepted views on the development of these vessels
  and contribute to a better understanding of mammalian vascular system development.
