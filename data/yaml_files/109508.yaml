scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of muriatic acid using electrical
  discharge. Despite employing the electric fluid as a preferable agent, no decomposition
  of the muriatic acid was achieved, leading the author to conclude that the acid's
  basis might be an unknown body that requires more complex affinities for separation.
