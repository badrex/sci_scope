revised_title: The Action of Free Molecules on Radiant Heat and its Conversion into
  Sound
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Acoustics
tldr: Tyndall's experiments investigate the absorption of radiant heat by free molecules
  and its conversion into sound. He demonstrates that the absorption of heat by liquids
  and vapors is the same, refuting the 'vapour-hesion' hypothesis. Additionally, he
  discusses the production of musical sounds through the intermittent absorption of
  radiant heat, as observed by Graham Bell.
