scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors investigate the correlation between barometric heights at various
  stations on the eastern side of the Atlantic, finding that there is a small but
  significant cross-Atlantic correlation after a certain interval of time. They also
  discover that as they move south from a station, they reach a point where there
  is no correlation, followed by a zone of negative correlation, and then another
  zone of positive correlation with less intensity.
