revised_title: Magnetic Circuits in Dynamo- and Magneto-Electric Machines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic circuits in dynamo- and magneto-electric
  machines, focusing on the initial force production and the role of residual magnetism.
  They demonstrate that the force is not due to residual magnetism but rather the
  lines of magnetic force of the earth, and discuss the effects of magnetic circuits
  on the retention of magnetism.
