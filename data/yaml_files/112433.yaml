revised_title: On the Cohesive Attraction and Aggregation of Blood-Corpuscles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the aggregation of blood-corpuscles and their behavior
  in different forms, concluding that cohesive attraction and physical laws are responsible
  for the phenomena, rather than an attractive force or energy. The study includes
  experiments with disk-shaped bodies and spherical vesicles to demonstrate the role
  of shape and attraction in the formation of rouleaux and other arrangements.
