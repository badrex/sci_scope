revised_title: The Experimental Verification of Ion Transit in the Electric Arc
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of ions in an electric arc and demonstrate
  that positively and negatively charged carriers travel from the positive and negative
  electrodes respectively along the arc in opposite directions, and bombard the opposite
  electrodes. The experiment is conducted under varying degrees of vacuum, and the
  results support the theory that ions are responsible for carrying the electric current
  in the arc.
