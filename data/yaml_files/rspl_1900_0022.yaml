revised_title: The Identification and Decomposition of the Poison in Lotus Arabicus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the poisonous properties of the Lotus Arabicus plant
  and discover that it contains a yellow crystalline glucoside called lotusin, which
  breaks down into prussic acid, sugar, and lotoflavin under the influence of a specific
  enzyme called lotase. This research helps identify the cause of poisoning in horses,
  sheep, and goats when consuming the plant.
