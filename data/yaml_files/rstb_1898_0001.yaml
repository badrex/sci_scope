tldr: This study investigates the afferent and efferent tracts in the cerebral cortex
  by examining the effects of lesions on the visual and auditory systems in monkeys.
  The researchers used the Marchi method to analyze the degeneration induced by these
  lesions and compared their findings with previous studies. The results provide insights
  into the organization and function of sensory tracts and centers in the brain.
