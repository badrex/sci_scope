revised_title: Clarifications on Hertz's Electromagnetic Waves and Oscillator Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Waves
tldr: The author critiques Hertz's electromagnetic wave theory, specifically the wave
  of magnetic induction, and suggests that experiments should be conducted at greater
  distances from the oscillator to achieve linear phase curves. The author also discusses
  the structure and affinities of fossil plants from Paleozoic rocks.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Waves
- Hertz's Experiments
- Oscillator Theory
- Simultaneous Partial Differential Equations
- Fossil Plants
