revised_title: Investigating Current Electricity in Plants during Vegetation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: H. F. Baxter's experimental inquiry investigates whether signs of current electricity
  are present in plants during vegetation. Baxter's findings, combined with previous
  research by Becquerel and Wartmann, suggest that electric currents exist in the
  leaves and roots of plants, potentially related to vital or organic changes.
