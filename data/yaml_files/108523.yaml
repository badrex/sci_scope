tldr: This paper presents a continuation and conclusion of a previous study on a class
  of differential equations and their applications in dynamical problems. The author
  discusses the method of variation of elements, applying it to the elliptic elements
  of a planet's orbit and the motion of a free simple pendulum. The paper also contains
  general theorems on the transformation of differential equations and their applications
  in planetary theory.
