revised_title: Measuring the Absolute Velocity of Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: A group of scientists from the Royal Society conducted experiments to measure
  the absolute velocity of electricity using a two-mile-long wire circuit. They found
  that the velocity of electricity was instantaneous through the entire length of
  the wire, confirming the speed of electrical discharge.
