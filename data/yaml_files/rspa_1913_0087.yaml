revised_title: Crystal Symmetry and Molecular Constitution in Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the crystal symmetry and molecular constitution of various
  organic compounds, including ethylene, acetylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
  phosgene, carbon oxysulphide, carbon bisulphide, methyl chloride, dichlormethane,
  trichlormethane, and tetrachlormethane. The study aims to understand the relationship
  between the crystal structures and molecular properties of these compounds.
