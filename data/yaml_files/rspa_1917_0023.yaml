revised_title: The Dissipation of Energy in Tides and its Connection with the Acceleration
  of the Moon's Mean Motion
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The authors investigate the dissipation of energy in tides and its connection
  with the acceleration of the moon's mean motion. They derive an expression for the
  rate of dissipation of kinetic energy in a sea and apply it to the Irish Sea, finding
  that viscosity may account for an appreciable part of the Earth's secular retardation.
