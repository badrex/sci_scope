scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: Peter Woulfe investigates the composition of selenitical and gypsum spars, discovering
  that they contain varying amounts of acid of vitriol, calcareous earth, and clayey
  matter. He also examines the transformation of crystal into selenitical spar and
  the presence of lead ore in the process.
