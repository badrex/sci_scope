scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the state of stress in curved beams under load, finding
  that in addition to the circumferential stress, there is a radial stress. The maximum
  stress occurs at the inner and outer surfaces of the beam, and the effect of curvature
  on the strength of the beam is expressed by the value of the coefficient.
