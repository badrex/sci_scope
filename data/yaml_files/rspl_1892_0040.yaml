tldr: The author examines the post-embryonic development of Ciona intestinalis and
  Clavelina lepadiformis, challenging previous theories on the homology of Ascidians
  and Amphioxus. The study focuses on the fixation and origin of gill-slits, providing
  new insights into the relationship between these species.
