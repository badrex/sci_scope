revised_title: The Radioactive Origin of Zircon Colors and Thermoluminescence
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Petrology
tldr: The author investigates the color and thermoluminescent properties of zircon
  minerals, discovering that their color and glow are restored by the radioactive
  matter within the mineral. This suggests that the color and thermoluminescence of
  zircons found in lavas have been restored by the slow action of their own radium
  over time.
