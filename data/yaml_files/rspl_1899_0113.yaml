revised_title: On Series and Convergence Boundaries
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author explores the relationship between limit operations, infinite sums
  and products, and convergence boundaries. They introduce the concept of an asymptotic
  region and apply it to transcendental integral functions, providing insights into
  the behavior of functions near essential singularities.
