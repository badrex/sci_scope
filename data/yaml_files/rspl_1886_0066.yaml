tldr: This study investigates the rest and movement of the intestine, particularly
  the upper part of the jejunum, in a dog with a Weller's fistula. The authors found
  that swallowing, mental impressions, and food ingestion can cause intestinal contractions.
  The speed of transit through the fistula varies depending on the condition of the
  animal and the time since the last meal. The study also examines the effects of
  exercise, mechanical irritation, and electrical stimulation on intestinal movement.
