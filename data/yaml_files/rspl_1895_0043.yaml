revised_title: Electrolysis of Gases and the Transport of Ions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The author investigates the electrolysis of gases using a spectroscope to detect
  the decomposition of gases by the electric discharge and the movement of ions in
  opposite directions along the discharge tube. The study reveals that the electrolytic
  transport of one gas through another is influenced by the charge carried by the
  ions and the pressure applied.
