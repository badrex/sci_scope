revised_title: Further Illustrations of the 'Law of Fatigue' in Animal Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Biomechanics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on human subjects to study the effects of fatigue
  on muscle performance. By analyzing the time participants can hold out extended
  arms holding weights before experiencing fatigue, the author demonstrates that the
  fatigue produced by small weights is as definite as that produced by large weights.
  This supports the application of the Law of Fatigue in understanding human physical
  performance.
