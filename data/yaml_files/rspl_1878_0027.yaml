revised_title: The Influence of Ozone on Nuclear Action in Supersaturated Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the nuclear action of oils on supersaturated saline
  solutions and discovers that ozone, or an oxidized condition, has a significant
  influence on this process. The findings challenge previous observations that oils
  have no nuclear action on these solutions.
