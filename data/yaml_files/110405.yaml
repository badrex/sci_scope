revised_title: A Study on Low-Temperature Combustion and Its Implications
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author, Charles J. B. Williams, presents evidence that most combustible
  substances undergo a low-temperature combustion process, producing light and heat.
  This phenomenon is observed in various organic compounds, and the author believes
  it can explain cases of spontaneous combustion in porous materials and heaps of
  coal, charcoal, and other combustible substances.
