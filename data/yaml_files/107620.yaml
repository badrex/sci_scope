scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeophysics & Solar System Studies
tldr: The author presents calculations of observations made during the solar eclipse
  on September 7, 1820, using lunar and solar tables to determine the error in the
  tables and the corrections needed for the semidiameter of the sun and moon. The
  results provide a means to fix the longitudes of various locations and compare phases
  observed at different spots.
