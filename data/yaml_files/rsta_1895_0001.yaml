revised_title: Improving the Sensitivity and Accuracy of the Cavendish Experiment
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: The author discusses improvements to the Cavendish experiment, focusing on the
  use of quartz fibers for torsion and a smaller, more sensitive apparatus. The new
  design allows for greater accuracy in measuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation.
