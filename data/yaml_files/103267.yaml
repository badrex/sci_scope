tldr: Dr. Robert Fielding shares his personal experience of being shot in the head
  with a musket-ball during a battle in the Civil Wars. The bullet remained in his
  head for nearly 30 years, causing various health issues and complications, including
  a flux of sanious matter from his nostrils, pain on the left side of his head, and
  the appearance of tumors. Eventually, the bullet was discovered and removed in August
  1672.
