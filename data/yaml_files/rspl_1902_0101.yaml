revised_title: 'The Brain of Archseoceti: A Comparative Analysis of Cranial Casts'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines two cranial casts of the Archseoceti brain, one artificial
  and one natural, and discusses their morphological differences and similarities.
  The natural cast reveals a unique brain shape, with a broad base and a narrow dorsal
  surface, while the artificial cast shows more rounded and expanded hemispheres.
  The author suggests that these differences may indicate a new genus of Archaeoceti
  or a distinct species within the Zeuglodon genus.
