scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Malacology & Molluscan Biology
tldr: The author investigates the anatomical features and natural affinities of Gasteropoda,
  focusing on the lingual dental organs and their role in classification. The study
  provides insights into the relationships between different genera and suggests that
  certain characteristics, such as the arrangement of dental plates and the structure
  of the tongue, can be used as indicators of affinity and classification within the
  order.
