revised_title: On Curves Circumscribing Rotating Polygons and Their Application to
  Drilled Hole Shapes
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the shapes of holes created by rotating polygons and
  drills, exploring the mathematical relationships and conditions that determine the
  symmetry and form of these holes. They also discuss the practical implications of
  their findings for drilling and hole-making processes.
