revised_title: 'Researches on the Hydrocarbons of the Series CnH2n+2: Structure and
  Boiling Points'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical structure and boiling points of various
  hydrocarbons in the series CnH2n+2, discovering that the boiling points can be used
  to deduce their structure and that they can be arranged into four groups based on
  their constitution.
