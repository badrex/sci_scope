revised_title: Spontaneous Nitrification and its Connection with Ozone Formation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author, C.F. Schoenbein, investigates the connection between the formation
  of nitric acid and ozone during the slow combustion of phosphorus in moist atmospheric
  air. He concludes that there is a strong reason to suspect that the formation of
  nitric acid is connected to the formation of ozone in these experiments.
