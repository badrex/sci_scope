revised_title: Ionization of Gases during Fermentation and its Electrical Effects
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical effects accompanying the decomposition
  of organic compounds during fermentation, specifically focusing on the ionization
  of gases produced. They discuss the implications of these findings for understanding
  the underlying processes of fermentation and potential applications in other fields.
