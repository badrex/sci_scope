scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pharmacology
tldr: The study investigates the distribution and action of soluble substances, such
  as adrenaline, strychnine, and morphine, in frogs without a circulatory system.
  The research demonstrates the existence of a peripheral mechanism that can distribute
  substances throughout the body, providing evidence for its role in various physiological
