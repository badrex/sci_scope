revised_title: Investigating Diamagnetic Polarization and the Influence of Diamagnetic
  Bodies on Electromagnetic Fields
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Faraday investigates the polarization of diamagnetic materials and their influence
  on electromagnetic fields through a series of experiments. He develops an apparatus
  to study the effects of diamagnetic bodies on electromagnetic fields and finds that
  the results do not support the existence of a polar condition in diamagnetic materials.
