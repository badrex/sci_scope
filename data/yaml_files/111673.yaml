revised_title: On the Relation between Boiling-Point and Composition in Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between boiling points and composition
  in organic compounds, focusing on alcohols, acids, and ethers. He presents a series
  of propositions to calculate boiling points based on composition and demonstrates
  their accuracy through experimental data. The author also discusses the boiling
  points of isomers and the importance of considering chemical character in understanding
  boiling point differences.
