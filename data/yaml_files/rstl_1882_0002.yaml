revised_title: Electromotive Properties of the Leaf of Dionaea in Excited and Unexcited
  States
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the Dionaea leaf in
  both excited and unexcited states, examining the distribution of electrical tension
  and the mechanisms behind the plant's excitatory motion. The study provides insights
  into plant electomotivity and excitability.
