revised_title: Experiments on Wave-Transit Velocities in Rock Formations at Holyhead,
  North Wales
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: The author investigates the transit-velocity of waves analogous to earthquake
  waves through rock formations at Holyhead, North Wales, using powerful explosions
  of gunpowder. The experiments reveal low velocities due to the heterogeneous and
  discontinuous nature of the rock formations, providing valuable insights into the
  propagation of waves through the Earth's crust.
