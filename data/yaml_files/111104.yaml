scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: Joseph Toynbee's paper describes the membrana tympani's structure, consisting
  of distinct layers, and its function in maintaining tension to receive sonorous
  undulations. The study refutes the idea that the fibrous layers are muscular and
  highlights the tensor tympani ligament's role.
