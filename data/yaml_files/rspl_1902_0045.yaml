revised_title: The Impact of Oxygen Atmosphere on Respiratory Exchange
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: Hill and Macleod's study investigates the effects of oxygen atmosphere on the
  respiratory exchange in mice. They found that a rapid increase in pressure to 70
  atmospheres had no mechanical effect on the blood circulation. The research also
  showed that the oxygen intake and carbonic acid output were not significantly influenced
  by moderate increases in atmospheric pressure.
