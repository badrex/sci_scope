tldr: Sir Humphry Davy conducts experiments on the combustion of diamond and other
  carbonaceous substances. Despite various conjectures about their chemical composition,
  his experiments show that diamond and these substances combine with the same amount
  of oxygen and form the same amount of carbonic acid. The presence of hydrogen in
  these substances is also discussed.
