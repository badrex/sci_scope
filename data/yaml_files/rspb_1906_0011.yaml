revised_title: 'Revisiting Heterotypical Mitoses in Cancer: A New Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The authors analyze the occurrence of heterotypical mitoses in cancer cells
  and provide evidence that these mitoses are actually somatic mitoses with longitudinally
  split chromosomes. They argue that the apparent heterotypical form is due to variations
  in the development of the achromatic figure, the peculiar form of the chromosomes,
  and their mode of attachment to the spindle.
