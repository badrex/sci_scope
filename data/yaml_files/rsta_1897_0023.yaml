revised_title: 'Cathode Rays and the Electrostatic Deflection: A Study of Shadow Formation
  and Electrification'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the electrostatic deflection of cathode rays and the
  effect of electrification on shadow formation. The study reveals that the size of
  the cathodic shadow depends on the electric state of the object, with positively
  electrified objects causing shadow contraction and negatively electrified objects
  causing shadow expansion.
