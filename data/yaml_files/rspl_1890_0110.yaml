revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Power Given by Any Electric Current to Any
  Circuit
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electromagnetism
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the power given by any electric
  current to any circuit, which is independent of the nature of the current or the
  circuit and only requires an ordinary alternating-current voltmeter. This method
  can be applied to measure the power given to alternating-current arcs and arc-lamps.
