scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Surveying
tldr: Captain Henry Kater compares various British standards of linear measure, including
  those of Sir George Shuckburgh, Bird, General Roy, the Royal Society, and Ramsden,
  and finds significant differences between them. He investigates the impact of these
  differences on the figure of the earth and concludes that the comparison given in
  Colonel Lambton's paper agrees with other estimates from lunar irregularities, pendulum
  experiments, and surface density of the earth.
