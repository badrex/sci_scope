revised_title: A Minute Analysis of the Motor Cortex in the Monkey
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the motor cortex in the monkey brain, focusing on the
  cortical center for the upper limb. They analyze the various movements produced
  by stimulating different regions of the motor cortex and discuss the anatomical
  features of the cortex, including the sulci and fissures. Their research contributes
  to the understanding of localizing motor functions in the brain.
