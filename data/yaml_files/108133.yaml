revised_title: Investigating the Existence and Formation of Carbonic Acid in Venous
  Blood
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the source and formation
  of carbonic acid in venous blood. The results suggest that carbonic acid can be
  absorbed by blood and retained without being separated by the removal of air pressure,
  and that hydrogen may have a role in removing carbonic acid from the blood.
