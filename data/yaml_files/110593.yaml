scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the influence of nitrogen on plant growth through experiments
  and chemical analysis. The results show that nitrogen and residual matter are abundant
  in plant parts that perform vital functions in plant physiology, suggesting that
  nitrogen, when combined with residual matter, acts as the driving force in plant
  growth.
