revised_title: Further Investigations on the Decomposition of Ammonia by Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the decomposition of ammonia by heat using porcelain
  vessels and a muffle furnace. They find that the rate of decomposition is influenced
  by the state of the globe and the temperature, with the highest rate occurring at
  1111°C. The results confirm previous observations that decomposition is never absolutely
  complete, but is negligible after heating at 1100°C for a short time.
