revised_title: 'Gravitational Instability and the Figure of the Earth: A Reassessment'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodynamics & Geophysics
tldr: This article investigates the stability of the Earth's figure and the role of
  gravitational instability in its formation. The author examines the effects of rigidity
  and hydrostatic pressure on the Earth's configuration, concluding that the spherically
  symmetrical configuration is stable for first harmonic displacements and that excentric
  distributions are unlikely under natural conditions.
