revised_title: Liquid Diffusion and its Applications in Separation and Analysis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry
tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, explores the concept of liquid diffusion and its
  applications in separating and analyzing crystalloids and colloids. He introduces
  the process of dialysis, which uses a semipermeable membrane to separate substances
  based on their diffusibility, and discusses the properties and potential uses of
  colloids in various fields, including medicine and chemistry.
