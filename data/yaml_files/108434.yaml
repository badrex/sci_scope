revised_title: Observations on the Freezing Point of Fresh and Spoiled Eggs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental & Reproductive Biology
tldr: The author investigates the freezing point of fresh and spoiled eggs, discovering
  that fresh eggs can be reduced to lower temperatures without freezing due to their
  mechanical construction and albumen's tenacity. The study suggests that the ability
  to resist freezing is not due to a vital principle but rather a property of the
  albumen's viscosity.
