revised_title: The Permanency of Magnetism in Soft Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author, Francis Watkins, investigates the magnetic power of soft iron and
  discovers that it retains magnetism even after the inducing cause has ceased. He
  demonstrates this through various experiments using electro-magnets, horse-shoe
  magnets, and the action of a magnetized needle. Watkins concludes that the phenomenon
  of the permanency of magnetism in soft iron can be explained as a case of complex
  induction between the soft iron horse-shoe and its keeper.
