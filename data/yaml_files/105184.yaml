scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: The author presents improvements to a machine for measuring a ship's way at
  sea, addressing its limitations and increasing its accuracy. The device uses a single
  brass plate with a spiral spring to reduce friction and withstand the forces of
  the sea, resulting in more consistent measurements.
