revised_title: Inquiries and Observations on Tides by Dr. Wallis
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: Dr. Wallis proposes inquiries and observations on tides to test his hypothesis
  that annual spring tides occur around February and November rather than at the equinoxes.
  He requests specific measurements of spring tides, new moon, and full moon between
  August and November to determine the highest tides and their relationship to low
  waters.
