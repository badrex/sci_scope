revised_title: Experiments on Electrical Effects in Vibrating Metals and Metallic
  Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical effects produced by vibrating metals
  and metallic bodies, specifically focusing on the impact of rust on the electrical
  effect. They find that rusting a wire decreases the electrical effect produced by
  its vibration more than can be attributed to the increase in resistance due to the
  decrease in cross-sectional area.
