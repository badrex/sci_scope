scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Dr. Wollaston investigates the oblique refraction of Iceland crystal and finds
  that the incipient undulations of light in the crystal are portions of an oblate
  spheroid. He demonstrates that his observations align with Huygens' hypothesis,
  providing a ratio between the sine of incidence and the sine of refraction.
