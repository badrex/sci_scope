tldr: The author investigates the laws of low water at the Port of Plymouth and the
  permanency of mean water, finding that the height of mean water is constant within
  two to three inches from year to year. The study also reveals a semimenstrual inequality
  of six to seven inches in the mean water height, with the greatest height occurring
  when the transit is at 6h and the least at 12h.
