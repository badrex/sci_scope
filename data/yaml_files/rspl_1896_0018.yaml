  Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials
tldr: Dewar and Fleming investigate the electrical resistivity of electrolytically
  prepared bismuth at the temperature of liquid air and find that its resistivity
  decreases regularly with decreasing temperature. They also study the effect of magnetic
  fields on the resistivity of bismuth and observe a significant increase in resistance
  when the bismuth is cooled to liquid air and placed in a magnetic field.
