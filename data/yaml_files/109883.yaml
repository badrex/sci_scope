revised_title: The Role of Wood Cellular Expansion and Contraction in Tree Physiology
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Forestry & Tree Biology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the expansion and contraction of timber in
  different directions relative to the position of the tree's medulla. He suggests
  that the expansion of the cellular processes in living trees is responsible for
  the propulsion of sap and may cause rifts in trees due to changes in moisture levels.
