  on its Retraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This paper presents an investigation into the magnetic properties of iron and
  the effect of an electric current on its retraction. The authors describe their
  experimental setup and findings, which show that the maximum magnetic elongation
  of an iron wire is increased when a current is present, while the retraction in
  strong fields is reduced. The study also highlights the importance of considering
  the time-rate of current rise in circuits with large electromagnetic inertia.
