  Terrestrial Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author examines the relationship between sunspot frequency and terrestrial
  magnetism, analyzing data from various magnetic observatories. They find that the
  constants a and b in the formula relating magnetic quantities to sunspot frequency
  vary depending on the period and location of the data, with some discrepancies due
  to heterogeneousness in the data.
