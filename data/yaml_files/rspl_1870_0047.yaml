revised_title: 'Effects of Climate Change on Human Physiology: A Study of Urine and
  Perspiration in Tropical and Temperate Regions'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of climate change on human physiology, specifically
  examining the changes in urine and perspiration excretion in tropical and temperate
  regions. The study shows that the kidneys are the primary eliminators of surplus
  water in both regions, but the skin plays a more significant role in tropical climates.
