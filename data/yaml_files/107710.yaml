revised_title: Investigating Electric Currents and Their Effects on Fluid Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author explores the motions and effects produced in fluid conductors, such
  as mercury, when transmitting electric currents. The study reveals that the motions
  are caused by the electric current's internal stream, which causes the mercury to
  circulate and move towards the negative pole due to friction and adhesion forces.
