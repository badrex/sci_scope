revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Action of a Helix on the Earth's Magnetic
  Lines of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: Faraday investigates the effect of a helix on the Earth's magnetic lines of
  force and discovers that it alters the direction of the neighboring lines of force.
  The helix's action on the dipping-needle can be observed in four quadrants, with
  the two neutral planes dividing the space around the magnet. The results demonstrate
  the influence of the helix on the Earth's magnetic field and its potential applications
  in understanding the sun's action on Earth's magnetic field.
