revised_title: A Method of Avoiding Collision at Sea Using Synchronized Signals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Navigation
tldr: The author proposes a method for avoiding collisions at sea using synchronized
  signals transmitted through different media, such as wireless and submarine bells.
  This method allows ships to estimate their distance from each other and determine
  if they are on a collision course, providing a safer navigation experience.
