revised_title: The Action of Calcium, Barium, and Potassium on Muscle Contraction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of calcium, barium, and potassium on muscle
  contraction in frogs. They find that calcium prolongs muscle contraction, while
  potassium shortens it. Barium produces a unique effect similar to veratria, which
  is later abolished by potassium. Further research on these findings is planned.
