revised_title: Investigation of Positive Ionisation Produced by Platinum and Certain
  Salts When Heated
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the positive ionisation produced by platinum and certain
  salts when heated, examining the effect of surrounding gas on thermionic currents
  from various substances. They find that the nature of the surrounding gas has a
  significant impact on the magnitude of the thermionic current.
