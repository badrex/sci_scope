revised_title: 'Colours in Metal Glasses and Metallic Films: A Theoretical Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the optical properties of metal glasses and metallic
  films, focusing on the colors produced by the presence of minute metal spheres.
  They discuss the observations of Siedentopf and Zsigmondy and explain the optical
  properties of gold ruby glass, as well as the changes in color and polarization
  effects in metal films upon heating.
