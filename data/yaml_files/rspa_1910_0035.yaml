scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author examines a case of red-blindness in a gentleman and confirms the
  sensation curves of green and blue through his observations. The study supports
  the trichromatic theory of color vision and provides evidence of the absence of
  the red sensation in the violet for the color-blind individual.
