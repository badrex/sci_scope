  the Influence of Celestial Motions on Light Refrangibility'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author, William Huggins, presents further observations on the spectra of
  stars, nebulae, and Comet II, discussing the influence of celestial motions on the
  refrangibility of light. He describes the limitations of his apparatus and the challenges
  of detecting small changes in refrangibility, while also discussing related theories
  and experiments by other scientists.
