revised_title: 'The Spectrum of Water: A New Discovery'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar discover the spectrum of water in various flames
  and electric sparks, revealing new insights into the emissive power of gaseous substances
  at low flame temperatures. Their findings challenge previous assumptions about flame
  spectra continuity and water vapor absorption.
