  Part II - Electrical Conductivity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the effects of stress and strain on the electrical conductivity
  of cobalt, magnesium, steel, and platinum-iridium. The research discovers simple
  relations between the 'critical points' of metals, revealing that the permanent
  decrease of specific resistance is greater with nickel than cobalt.
