revised_title: Morphological Complexity in Bacterial Life-Cycles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the morphological changes in bacteria under different
  environmental conditions and concludes that bacteria can reproduce in ways other
  than simple binary fission. This challenges the current understanding of bacteria
  as unicellular organisms and suggests that their life-cycles are more complex than
  previously thought.
