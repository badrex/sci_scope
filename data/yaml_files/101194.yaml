tldr: Dr. Beale proposes experiments to investigate the effects of air on plant growth
  and development using Boyle's Pneumatic Engine. He suggests testing the germination
  of seeds, the growth of sensitive plants, the grafting of pears onto spina cervina,
  and the hatching of silkworm eggs in an air-exhausted environment. The experiments
  aim to determine the extent to which plants rely on air for their growth and development.
