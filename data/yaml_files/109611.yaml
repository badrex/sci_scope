revised_title: Magnetic Attraction of Iron Oxides and the Role of Inflammable Matter
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author, Timothy Lane, investigates the magnetic properties of iron oxides
  and finds that they are not magnetic until combined with inflammable substances
  through heat. When the inflammable substances are separated through further heating,
  the oxides return to their non-magnetic state.
