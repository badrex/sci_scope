revised_title: A Novel Gyroscopic Phenomenon and Its Mechanism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a new gyroscopic phenomenon where a gyroscope, when spun
  and given a slight horizontal motion, rises up a vertical rod with a spiral and
  vibratory motion. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is explained by the interaction
  of centrifugal couples, friction, and the oscillatory variations of speed in the
  gyroscope's motion.
