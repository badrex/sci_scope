revised_title: Synthesised Proteid-like Substances and Their Physiological Reactions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Biophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical and physiological reactions of synthesized
  proteid-like substances, finding that they exhibit similar properties to natural
  proteins. They also observe that these substances cause intravascular coagulation
  of the blood when injected into animals, similar to the action of nucleo-proteids.
