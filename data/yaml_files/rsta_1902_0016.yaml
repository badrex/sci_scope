revised_title: 'The Mechanism of the Electric Arc: A New Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of the electric arc, proposing that its
  behavior can be explained without invoking negative resistance or back electromotive
  force. The arc's formation and high temperature are attributed to the evaporation
  of carbon, the presence of carbon mist, and the interaction between the arc's components.
