revised_title: Experimental Investigation of Water Compressibility
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The author, Jacob Perkins, conducts experiments to determine the compressibility
  of water using a piezometer. He finds that water compresses by approximately one
  percent under high pressure and explores the effects of pressure on various containers
  and sealings. Perkins also develops a new piezometer design to improve accuracy
  and plans to create a machine capable of much greater pressure to further study
  water compressibility.
