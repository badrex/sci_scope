revised_title: A General Law of Density in Saturated Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Gas Laws
tldr: The author, J.J. Waterston, investigates the relationship between pressure,
  temperature, and density of saturated vapors. He discovers a general law that can
  be applied to various substances, such as steam, ether, alcohol, and carbon sulfide,
  by analyzing the data from the French Academy's experiments and projecting the results
  into a curve.
