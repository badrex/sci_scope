revised_title: On the Conditions of Equilibrium of an Incompressible Fluid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Mechanics
tldr: The author examines the principles and methods for solving the problem of fluid
  equilibrium, focusing on the conditions necessary for a fluid to be in equilibrium
  under the action of accelerating forces. The study demonstrates the insufficiency
  of the principle of equal pressure for determining the figure of equilibrium and
  outlines the necessary conditions for solving the problem in all cases.
