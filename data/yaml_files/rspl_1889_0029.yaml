revised_title: Notes on the Absorption Spectra of Oxygen and Its Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption spectra of oxygen and its compounds under
  varying pressures and temperatures. They observe the persistence of molecular constitution
  in gaseous and liquid oxygen, and study the absorption of ozone, finding that it
  has a general character with faint absorption bands.

- Oxygen Absorption Spectra
- Oxygen Compounds
