tldr: The author examines the correlation between sunspot activity and rainfall patterns,
  analyzing data from various stations in Great Britain and India. The study suggests
  that there may be a probable difference of about 2 inches of rain between years
  of greatest and least sunspot activity, but more extensive observations are needed
  to confirm this connection.
