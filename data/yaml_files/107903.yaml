revised_title: On the Elasticity of Glass Threads and Their Applications to Torsion
  Balances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Solid State Physics
tldr: The author investigates the elasticity of glass threads and their potential
  applications to torsion balances. He explains the phenomenon of torsion and its
  relationship to the atomic structure of matter, and demonstrates the potential for
  glass threads to be twisted without breaking due to their unique molecular structure.
  The author also describes the construction and use of a torsion galvanometer, which
  can be used to measure the relative quantities of electric currents.
