revised_title: The Histology and Pigment Development in Chromatophores of Higher Crustacea
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the histology and pigment development in the chromatophores
  of higher crustaceans, focusing on Hippolyte and Crangon species. They describe
  the distribution, structure, and pigments present in the chromatophores, as well
  as the process of pigment development and the role of light conditions in their
  formation.
