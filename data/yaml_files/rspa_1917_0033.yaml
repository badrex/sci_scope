revised_title: The High-Frequency Resistance of Multiply-Stranded Insulated Wire
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The authors investigate the high-frequency resistance of multiply-stranded insulated
  wire and develop formulae to determine the effective resistance of such conductors.
  They also explore the effects of eddy currents on the resistance and provide recommendations
  for optimizing the space factor and strand arrangement for minimum resistance.
topics:
- Electrical Conductivity
- High Frequency
- Eddy Currents
- Wire Insulation
- Resistance
