revised_title: An Analysis of the Helmholtz Resonator Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: Lord Rayleigh investigates the Helmholtz resonator, a device used to study sound
  waves, and provides a mathematical analysis of its behavior. He derives equations
  to describe the resonator's response to different frequencies and discusses the
  effects of aperture size and energy propagation.
