revised_title: Determination of Vertical and Lateral Pressures of Granular Substances
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geotechnical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the vertical and lateral pressures of granular substances,
  specifically wheat, in storage bins. Experiments with models led to the conclusion
  that pressure upon the bottom of the bin ceases at a certain height, and a formula
  is proposed to determine the pressure upon any given area. The author then conducts
  large-scale experiments to determine both vertical and lateral pressures, providing
  insights into the behavior of granular materials under pressure.
