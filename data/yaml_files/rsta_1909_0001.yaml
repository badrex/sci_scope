revised_title: Determination of the Atomic Weight of Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the atomic weight of chlorine by burning hydrogen in
  an atmosphere of chlorine and condensing the hydrogen chloride formed. The results
  show a mean atomic weight of chlorine of 35.462, with a close concordance to previous
  experiments and recent determinations.
