revised_title: The Discovery of Hydrogen Stratifications and their Behavior under
  Induction Current
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: Sir William Crookes investigates the behavior of hydrogen under the influence
  of an induction current, discovering the stratifications of hydrogen and the challenges
  in eliminating mercury vapor from the gas. The research reveals that the color and
  structure of the stratifications change based on the electrical conditions and exhaustion
  levels.
