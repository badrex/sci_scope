revised_title: Innovative Compass Design for Measuring the Variation of the Horizontal
  Needle
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: George Graham describes the design and testing of a specialized compass box
  that allows for precise measurements of the variation of the horizontal needle.
  The device is tested in various environments and found to be accurate, providing
  valuable data for understanding magnetic declination and variation.
