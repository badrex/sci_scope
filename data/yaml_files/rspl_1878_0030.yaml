revised_title: On the Reversal of Metallic Vapour Spectra and the Absorption Effects
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Interactions
tldr: The authors investigate the reversal of metallic vapor spectra and the absorptive
  effects on continuous spectra. They develop a method to observe the reversal of
  metallic vapor spectra by using iron tubes and controlling the temperature and hydrogen
  flow. They also discuss the absorption spectra of sodium and potassium and the chemical
  interactions between metallic vapors.
