tldr: The author presents a method for mapping the spectra of calcium, strontium,
  and barium, and discusses the challenges of eliminating impurities and determining
  the positions and lengths of new lines. The author also highlights the need for
  greater precision in future studies of the solar spectrum and the potential impact
  of molecular vibrations on spectral intensities.
