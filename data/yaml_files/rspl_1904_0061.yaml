revised_title: Conductivity and Solubility of Liquefied Hydrides in Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the solubility and conductivity of liquefied hydrides
  of phosphorus, sulfur, and halogens in various organic compounds. They find that
  the dissolved organic substances, such as amine salts and acid amides, contribute
  to the conductivity of the solutions, while the inorganic substances do not. The
  molecular conductivity increases with concentration, and temperature coefficients
  are mostly positive, indicating an increase in conductivity with rising temperature.
