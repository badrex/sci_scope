revised_title: On the Relation between Surface-Tension of Liquids and Supersaturation
  of Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between surface tension and supersaturation
  in saline solutions, finding that a decrease in surface tension leads to crystallization
  and the end of supersaturation. They also explore the effects of heat and various
  substances on surface tension and supersaturation.
topics:
- Surface Tension
- Supersaturated Solutions
- Saline Solutions
- Crystallization
- Capillary Action
