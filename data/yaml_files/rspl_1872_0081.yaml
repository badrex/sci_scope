revised_title: Observations of Sunspot Hemispherical Excess and Oscillations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the tendency of sunspots to change alternately between
  the solar hemispheres and observe a mean oscillation period of 25.2 days during
  periods of significant solar disturbance. They also suggest a possible connection
  between these oscillations, the latitude and longitude of sunspots, and future observations
  to verify their conjecture.
