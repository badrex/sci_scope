revised_title: A New Theory on the Ascent of Sap in Trees
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology
tldr: The authors propose a new theory for the ascent of sap in trees, suggesting
  that it is due to a simple tensile stress exerted on the liquid in the conduits,
  rather than differences in gas pressure. They demonstrate this through experiments
  involving transpiration against external pressures and analyze the structure of
  the conducting tissues in trees.
