revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Moon's Declination on Barometer Readings
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the moon's declination and barometer
  readings, finding a potential correlation between the two. The study suggests that
  the moon's position in declination may have an impact on atmospheric pressure, with
  a nearly one-tenth of an inch elevation observed for every 17 degrees of declination.
