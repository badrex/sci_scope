scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: This study investigates the role of phagocytes in the infection process of cerebrospinal
  meningitis, specifically focusing on the meningococcus. The authors explore the
  possibility that living meningococci can remain within leucocytes, which may convey
  infection into the spinal canal, causing meningitis.
