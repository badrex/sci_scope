revised_title: Investigating the Length of Electric Sparks from Silver Cell Batteries
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the length of electric sparks produced by silver cell
  batteries and find that the length of the spark is directly proportional to the
  square of the number of cells in the battery. They also observe phenomena such as
  glow surrounding the terminals and the influence of vacuum tubes on the spark length.
