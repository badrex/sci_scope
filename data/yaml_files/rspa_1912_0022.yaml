  in Thin Rectangular Plates
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The authors develop an optical method using transparent nitro-cellulose to determine
  the distribution of shear stress in thin rectangular plates. They describe the experimental
  setup and the method of experiment, providing a new approach to studying shear stress
  in materials.
