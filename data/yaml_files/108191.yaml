revised_title: On the Nature of Induction and Conduction in Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Faraday investigates the relationship between induction and conduction in dielectrics,
  proposing that both effects result from the action of contiguous particles and are
  governed by a common law. He also explores the role of tension and polarization
  in insulation and conduction, suggesting that insulators can retain a polarized
  state while conductors cannot.
