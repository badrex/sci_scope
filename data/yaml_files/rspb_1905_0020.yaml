revised_title: Inhibition and Excitation in the Direct-Flexion Reflex
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the direct-flexion reflex and finds that inhibition
  and excitation occur simultaneously. The study examines the relationship between
  skin fields, afferent nerve trunks, and the central nervous system in eliciting
  these phenomena. The findings suggest that inhibition is a normal part of the reflex
  process, working alongside excitation in antagonistic muscles.
