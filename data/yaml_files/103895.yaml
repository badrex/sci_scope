tldr: The author presents a mathematical treatise on conic sections and the use of
  fluxions in solving various mathematical problems. The treatise is divided into
  three books, covering conic sections, direct method of fluxions, and inverse method
  of fluxions. The author introduces new principles and methods for solving problems
  related to maxima, minima, and curve properties.
topics:
- Conic Sections
- Fluxions
- Geometry
- Calculus
- Optics
