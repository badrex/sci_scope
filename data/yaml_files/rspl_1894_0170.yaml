  and Analyzing Results'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This study compares the crusher-gauge method and a weight-based method for measuring
  pressures produced by fired gunpowder. The authors find that the crusher-gauge method
  provides accurate measurements of maximum pressure, while the weight-based method
  is more suitable for determining the pressure required to prevent gas blowout. The
  study also discusses the limitations of calculating pressure from temperature and
  gas expansion coefficients.
