revised_title: Equilibrium of a Homogeneous Fluid Mass in Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass in rotation,
  considering both cases where particles do not attract each other and when they have
  attractive powers. Two methods are presented to derive the fundamental laws of this
  equilibrium, with the newest and simplest one being based on the properties of inverse
  square attraction.
