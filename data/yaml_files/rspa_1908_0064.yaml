revised_title: 'Studies of the Processes Operative in Solutions: Parts VI-X'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the processes operative in solutions, focusing on the
  nature of dissolution, hydrolysis, and electrolytic conductivity. They propose that
  dissolution involves associative and distributive changes, and that the properties
  of solutions are determined by the interactions between solvent and solute molecules.
topics:
- Chemical Interactions
- Dissolution
- Hydrolysis
- Electrolytic Conductivity
- Solution Properties
