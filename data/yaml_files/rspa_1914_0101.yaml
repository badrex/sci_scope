revised_title: Investigation of Fluid Flow through Smooth Circular Pipes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author examines the flow of viscous fluids through smooth circular pipes,
  focusing on the relationship between the fluid's properties, pipe dimensions, and
  pressure. The study provides a formula for calculating resistance and pressure drop,
  which can be applied to various fluids and pipe dimensions.
