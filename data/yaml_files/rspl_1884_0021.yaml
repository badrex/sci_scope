scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, examines historical accounts of boiling phenomena
  in vessels and conducts experiments to understand the factors affecting boiling.
  He finds that the outer vessel's contact with the heat source and evaporation play
  significant roles in the observed effects.
