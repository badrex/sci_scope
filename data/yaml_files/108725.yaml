revised_title: 'On an Extension of Arbogast''s Method of Derivations: A New Approach
  to Column Formation'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Combinatorics
tldr: The author extends Arbogast's method of derivations to develop a rule for forming
  a single column apart from others. The process involves expansions and contractions
  of pairs of letters in a term, resulting in a unique column formation. The author
  also introduces the concept of reversible contractions, which allows for the generation
  of all terms in a column without repetition.
