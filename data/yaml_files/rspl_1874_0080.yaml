revised_title: Investigating Rolling Friction and Surface Deformation
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author examines the resistance to rolling and the role of surface deformation
  and friction in the process. They find that the resistance to rolling is influenced
  by the softness of the surfaces and the extent of slipping, and that friction affects
  the deformation at the point of contact. The study also highlights the importance
  of surface irregularities, heat transfer, and material viscosity in the overall
  resistance to rolling.
