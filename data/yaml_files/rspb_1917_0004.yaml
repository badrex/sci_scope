revised_title: The Toxic Action of Dilute Pure Sodium Chloride Solutions on the Meningococcus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The author investigates the toxic effects of dilute sodium chloride solutions
  on the meningococcus and discovers that a specific concentration of sodium chloride
  is toxic to the meningococcus, while bivalent salts can antagonize this toxicity.
  The meningococcus can also resist the hypotonic action of distilled water for several
  hours.
