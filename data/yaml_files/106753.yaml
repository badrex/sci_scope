revised_title: Investigating the Laws of Friction and its Effects on Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Motion
tldr: The author, Samuel Vince, investigates the laws of friction and its effects
  on motion through a series of experiments. He concludes that friction is a uniformly
  retarding force and its quantity is directly proportional to the pressure or weight
  of the moving object.
