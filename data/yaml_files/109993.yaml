revised_title: The Influence of Voltaic Battery on Nerve Division Effects
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Neuromuscular Diseases
tldr: The author investigates the effects of dividing the eighth pair of nerves and
  how the use of a voltaic battery can counteract the negative consequences. The study
  shows that when the nerves are divided, digestion is impaired, but applying galvanism
  to the nerves can restore digestion and prevent dyspnoea.
