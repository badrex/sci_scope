scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors develop a new chronographic measurement method to study the acceleration
  period of an explosion in gaseous explosive mixtures. They describe the design and
  capabilities of their instrument, and present results showing the accuracy and precision
  of their measurements.
