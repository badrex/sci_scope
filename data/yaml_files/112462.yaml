scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Anatomy & Embryology
tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the thyroid body in human foetuses, investigating
  its connections to the trachea and larynx, and its relationship with the thymus
  gland. The study concludes that the thyroid is developed in connection with the
  air-tube and has no relation to the thymus, and that the isthmus and pyramid are
  present from the beginning of development.
