tldr: The author describes an extraordinary case of inguinal hernia, which resulted
  in the patient's death. The autopsy revealed massive gastrointestinal distention
  and inflammation, suggesting that the use of hot fomentations may have exacerbated
  the condition. The author also briefly mentions an observation of the passage of
  Mercury over the Sun on October 31, 1738.
