revised_title: Investigations into Voltaic Electricity and Electro-Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author conducts experimental research on voltaic electricity and electro-magnetism,
  challenging the prevailing theories of the time. He demonstrates that voltaic action
  can occur without the contact of dissimilar metals and that free electricity developed
  by heat does not become voltaic. The study also highlights the differences between
  free and voltaic electricity, as well as the limitations of existing theories on
  the subject.
