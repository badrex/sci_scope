revised_title: 'On the Extension and Flexure of Cylindrical and Spherical Thin Elastic
  Shells: A New Approach'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a new theory for the extension and flexure of cylindrical
  and spherical thin elastic shells, which assumes that external forces, such as pressures
  or tangential stresses, are not acting on the shell's surfaces. This hypothesis
  allows for the calculation of stresses and the derivation of equations of motion
  without the need for determining unknown coefficients, leading to a more accurate
  understanding of shell behavior.
