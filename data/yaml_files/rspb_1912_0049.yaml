tldr: This study by Marie C. Stopes and D. H. Scott reveals the existence of angiosperms
  in England during Aptian times, a geological period when they were previously thought
  not to exist in Northern Europe. The researchers describe the anatomy of three new
  genera of fossils found in the Lower Greensand, which are the oldest angiosperms
  of which the anatomy is preserved and are contemporaneous with Bennettites.
