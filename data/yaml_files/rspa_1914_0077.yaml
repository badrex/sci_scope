  Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of gases, such as nitrogen, hydrogen,
  and oxygen, in discharge tubes using a sodium-potassium alloy and mercury as cathodes
  and anodes. They find that the amount of gas absorbed is related to the quantity
  of electricity passing through the circuit and the pressure of the gas. The results
  suggest that chemical compounds form between the gases and the metals.
