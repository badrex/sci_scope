scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the occlusion of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum black
  and find that the occlusive power of platinum sponge is less than that of other
  forms of platinum. They also discover that platinum black has a unique behavior
  in absorbing hydrogen when heated and allowed to cool down gradually.
