tldr: The author, Brook Taylor, presents a new method of representing objects in linear
  perspective, focusing on the principles and theorems of the art. He introduces new
  terms and concepts, such as vanishing points and lines, to create more general and
  accurate representations. The book covers five sections, including the representation
  of shadows, reflections, and inverse perspective.
