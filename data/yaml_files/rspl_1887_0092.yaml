scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the concept of dispersion equivalents, a property that
  can help investigate the chemical structure of compounds. They analyze the dispersion
  of various substances and discuss the relationship between dispersion and refraction,
  as well as the influence of temperature on these properties.
topics:
- Optical Properties
- Chemical Structure
- Refraction Equivalents
- Dispersion
- Atomic Constitution
