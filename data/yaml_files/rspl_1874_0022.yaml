revised_title: On Acoustic Reversibility and the Mystery of the 1822 Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of acoustic reversibility and the failure
  of sound transmission in the 1822 experiments conducted by the Royal Society. The
  experiments demonstrate that sound is only effectively transmitted in one direction,
  and the author proposes a possible explanation for this enigma.
