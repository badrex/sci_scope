revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Temperature on Radium and Transformation
  Products' Activity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors study the effect of temperature on the activity of radium and its
  transformation products. They find that the activity decreases after heating to
  1000Â°C or higher, suggesting that the rate of decay of radium C is increased at
  high temperatures.
