revised_title: On the Thermal Expansion of Sea-Water
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Sciences
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the law of thermal expansion
  of sea-water and found that the specific gravity of sea-water decreases with increasing
  temperature. They provide a formula to calculate the specific gravity of sea-water
  at any temperature between 0°C and 36°C.
