revised_title: Investigation of Cobalt Salts' Absorption Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines the absorption spectra of cobalt salts, discovering that
  the spectrum remains consistent across various solvents and concentrations. The
  study also reveals the formation of a new compound when cobalt chloride is fused
  with other solid chlorides, and the effects of heat and water on these compounds.
