revised_title: On the Critical Point of Mixed Vapours and Liquefaction of Carbonic
  Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of carbonic acid in the presence of different
  vapors above the critical point, observing the formation of distinct layers and
  the mixing of liquids. The study provides insights into the critical point of mixed
  vapors and the liquefaction of carbonic acid.
topics:
- Phase transitions
- Critical point
