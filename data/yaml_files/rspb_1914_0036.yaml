scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathogen Biology
tldr: The authors investigate a strain of Trypanosoma brucei from Zululand and describe
  its morphology, comparing it to the original 1896 strain. They find that the new
  strain exhibits a well-marked dimorphic type, suggesting that it belongs to the
  same species causing disease in various regions.
