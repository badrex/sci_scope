scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Lunar Studies
tldr: John Bevis and James Short observed a lunar eclipse at Mr. Graham's in Fleet-Street.
  They used a reflecting telescope to measure the shadow's appulse to the spot on
  Tycho and estimated the beginning and end of the eclipse with the naked eye and
  a refracting telescope. Their observations could be useful for geographical purposes.
