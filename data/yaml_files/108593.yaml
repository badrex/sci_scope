scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author explores the representation and properties of polyhedra, focusing
  on the relationship between their faces and summits. The article discusses the concept
  of autopolar and sympolar pairs of polyhedra and presents methods for representing
  these structures using closed polygons and quadruplets.
