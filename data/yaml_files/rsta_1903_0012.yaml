revised_title: The Specific Heats of Metals and the Relation of Specific Heat to Atomic
  Weight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the specific heats of various metals and their relation
  to atomic weight, finding that the influence of temperature on specific heat is
  inversely proportional to atomic weight and that the assumption of a constant atomic
  heat at absolute zero is untenable.
