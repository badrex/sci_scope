revised_title: Determination of Ice Density and Coefficient of Cubical Expansion
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the density and coefficient of cubical expansion of
  ice using a modified hydrostatic balance. The study confirms Nichols' value for
  the density of artificial ice but highlights that the Bunsen ice calorimeter's accuracy
  in absolute determinations is limited to about one in a thousand due to varying
  ice densities from the same water sample.
