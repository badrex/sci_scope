revised_title: Investigation of Hue Changes in Spectrum Colours by Dilution with White
  Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the changes in hue of spectrum colours when mixed with
  white light, discovering that the addition of white causes a shift in hue towards
  yellow in the red, green, and blue-green regions of the spectrum. The study provides
  insights into discrepancies observed in colour descriptions and offers a hypothesis
  for the change in hue based on the proportions of red, green, and blue in white
  light.
