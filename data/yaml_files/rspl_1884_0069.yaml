revised_title: Investigation of Electromagnetic Rotation of Light in Bisulphide of
  Carbon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: Lord Rayleigh investigates the electromagnetic rotation of light in bisulphide
  of carbon, finding that the rotation of sodium light in the substance is approximately
  0.04202 minutes. The study also includes remarks on polarimetry and a discussion
  of absorption-spectra thermograms.
