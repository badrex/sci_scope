tldr: The author describes a case where a woman was infected with smallpox through
  skin contact with a patient, despite having had the disease before. The infection
  was localized and did not cause fever or other symptoms, suggesting that a person
  who has had smallpox may be susceptible to reinfection in a limited form. The time
  it took for the infection to show itself was also different from that observed in
  inoculation cases.
