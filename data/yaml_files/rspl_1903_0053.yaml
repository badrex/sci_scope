revised_title: Properties and Behavior of Aluminium-Tin Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This study investigates the properties and behavior of aluminium-tin alloys,
  including their melting points, phase transitions, and corrosion resistance. The
  authors find that these alloys can be melted in various proportions and that their
  cooling curves reveal unique characteristics. They also observe that the alloys
  decompose water with the evolution of hydrogen, which affects their corrosion resistance.
