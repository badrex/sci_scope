revised_title: A Method for Registering Magnetic Variations
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Charles Brooke describes a method for registering magnetic variations using
  a light stream, a concave mirror, a cylindrical lens, and photographic paper. The
  method involves capturing the image of a vertical light stream on the paper, which
  shifts its position according to the movements of the magnet, thus creating a distinct
  and registered magnetic curve of variation.
