revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Heat on the Electric Properties of Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism
tldr: Edward Delaval conducts experiments to understand the relationship between heat
  and the electric properties of various substances. He discovers that different substances
  require specific degrees of heat to become electric or non-electric, and that some
  substances, like island crystal, can have opposite reactions to heat.
