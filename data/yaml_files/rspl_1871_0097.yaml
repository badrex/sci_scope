revised_title: Note on the Attraction of Spheroids and the Figure of the Earth
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Geophysics
tldr: The author extends Poisson's work on the attraction of spheroids and the figure
  of the Earth, demonstrating the truth of the formulae for all orders of the standard
  small quantity. The study focuses on the potential of a homogeneous body at any
  point and the attraction of external and internal particles.
