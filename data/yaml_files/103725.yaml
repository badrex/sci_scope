revised_title: Discovery of a New Motion of Fixed Stars and the Nutation of Earth's
  Axis
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: James Bradley discovers a new motion of fixed stars that cannot be attributed
  to annual parallax or nutation of Earth's axis. He concludes that the cause of this
  motion is related to the Sun's position with respect to the equinoctial points and
  begins to develop an instrument to further investigate this phenomenon.
