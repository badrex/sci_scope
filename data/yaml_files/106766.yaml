revised_title: Experiments on the Diminution of Atmospheric Air by the Electric Spark
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Henry Cavendish conducts experiments to investigate the diminution of atmospheric
  air by the electric spark. He finds that the real cause of the diminution is the
  conversion of phlogisticated air into nitrous acid. The experiments provide evidence
  against the phlogiston theory and contribute to the understanding of air composition
  and electrochemistry.
