revised_title: An Improved Method for Measuring Carbonic Acid in Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Environmental Chemistry
tldr: The author presents an instrument for the speedy volumetric determination of
  carbonic acid in air, using potassium hydrate to absorb carbonic acid and measure
  the volume of dry atmospheric air required to restore atmospheric pressure. This
  method allows for accurate measurement of carbonic acid proportions in the air,
  with potential applications in environmental and atmospheric chemistry.
