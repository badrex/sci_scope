revised_title: 'The Theory of Photographic Processes: Part III - The Latent Image
  and its Destruction'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: This article investigates the formation and destruction of latent images on
  photo-films, focusing on the chemical reactions involved in development and the
  role of gelatin in protecting the image. The authors also explore the effects of
  various agents, such as oxidizers and desensitizers, on the latent image and its
  development.
