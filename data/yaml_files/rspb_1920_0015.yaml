revised_title: The Development of Photosynthetic Activity during Germination in Young
  Seedling Leaves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the development of photosynthetic activity in young
  seedling leaves during germination, using a method that measures oxygen production.
  They find that the assimilatory power of leaves depends more on the age of the leaf
  than its color, and that it increases over time as the leaves develop chlorophyll
  and become capable of performing photosynthesis.
