revised_title: Hydrocarbon Analysis of Boghead Coal Products
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The author examines the products of destructive distillation of boghead coal
  and isolates various hydrocarbons, including propyl, butyl, amyl, and caproyl. The
  study confirms the radical nature of these hydrocarbons and refutes the assumption
  that they are homologues of marsh-gas.
