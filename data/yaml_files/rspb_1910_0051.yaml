revised_title: Comparative Toxicity of Theobromine and Caffeine on Muscle Contractility
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: This study investigates the comparative toxicity of theobromine and caffeine
  on muscle contractility. The results show that caffeine is more toxic than theobromine,
  with the toxic value of theobromine being approximately 1.7 times less than caffeine
  for equal molecules or 1.8 times less for equal weights.
