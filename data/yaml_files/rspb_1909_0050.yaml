revised_title: Investigating the Presence of Carbon Monoxide in Normal Blood and Blood
  of Chloroform-Anesthetized Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors examine the presence of carbon monoxide in normal blood and blood
  of animals anesthetized with chloroform. They find that the excessive residual gas
  in chloroform-anesthetized animals is primarily chloroform vapor or its decomposition
  products, rather than carbon monoxide. The authors question the conclusions of previous
  studies that claimed the presence of carbon monoxide in normal and anesthetized
  blood.
