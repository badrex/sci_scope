revised_title: Inter-crystalline Fracture of Metals under Prolonged Application of
  Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate inter-crystalline fracture in various metals, such as
  brass, aluminum alloys, lead, and mild steel, under prolonged stress. They propose
  an explanation for this type of fracture, which involves an amorphous intercrystalline
  cement between adjacent crystals in the metal. This hypothesis correlates the phenomena
  with other known facts and provides a rational account of the mechanism of this
  type of fracture.
