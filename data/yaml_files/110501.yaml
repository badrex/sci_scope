tldr: Messrs. Arnold and Dent propose using glass as a substitute for metal balance-springs
  in chronometers due to its superior elasticity and resistance to temperature variations.
  They demonstrate that glass springs experience less loss of elasticity when exposed
  to increased temperatures and perform experiments to validate their claims. Chronometers
  with glass balance-springs are now being tested at the Royal Observatory.
