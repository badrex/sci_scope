revised_title: Identification of Chitin by Physical Constants
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the physical constants of chitin from various sources
  and concludes that the specific gravity and refractive index can be used as a positive
  means of identifying chitin, providing valuable information for its distribution
  in the animal kingdom.
