scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This paper extends the author's previous work on the calculus of symbols, focusing
  on resolving functions of non-commutative symbols into binomial factors, finding
  the highest common internal divisor of two functions, and applying these methods
  to linear differential equations and the binomial theorem.
