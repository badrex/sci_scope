  Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: This article investigates the efficiency of horizontal receivers and transmitters
  in wireless telegraphy, comparing different arrangements and their effects on the
  transmitted waves. The author examines the orientation and length of the receiving
  conductor, as well as the phase differences between the oscillations in the receiver
  and the transmitted waves.
