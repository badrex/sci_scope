revised_title: Investigating the Screening Influence of Substances on Magnetic Action
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author explores the influence of screens, particularly iron, copper, and
  lead, on the progress of magnetic action. He discovers that the screening power
  of these substances depends on the mass and magnetic energy, and that this power
  is more or less common to every class of substance.
