revised_title: A Geometric Approach to Music Theory and Proportions
scientific_discipline: Music & Acoustics
scientific_subdiscipline: Music Theory & Composition
tldr: The author presents a method for reducing music theory to arithmetical and geometrical
  proportions, demonstrating the use of a viol as a musical instrument with precisely
  calculated frets. The article explains how this approach can be applied to other
  instruments and provides a foundation for mathematical certainty in music.
