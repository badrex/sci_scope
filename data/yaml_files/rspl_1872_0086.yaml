tldr: The author investigates the role of the ciliary body and the iris in the accommodation
  of vision. He concludes that the increase in lens convexity during near vision is
  achieved by the compression of the lens equator by an erectile cushion composed
  of ciliary processes and the ciliary muscle. The iris aids in accommodation by increasing
  its rapidity, but accommodation can still be achieved without it.
