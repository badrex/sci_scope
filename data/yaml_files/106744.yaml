scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrogeology & Groundwater
tldr: Erasmus Darwin describes the process of creating an artificial spring of water
  by boring through layers of earth and marl, resulting in a new water source with
  properties similar to a nearby well. The experiment demonstrates the potential for
  creating artificial springs for various purposes, such as improving land and providing
  water at a higher level than traditional wells.
