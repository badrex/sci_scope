scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: 'The authors investigate the production of characteristic X-ray radiations and
  propose two distinct ways in which matter can become a source of radiation: primary
  rays being scattered and secondary X-ray emission due to the ionization of matter.'
