revised_title: Investigation of Current, Voltage, Pressure, and Dark Space Length
  in Different Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between current, voltage, pressure,
  and the length of the dark space in various gases, including carbon monoxide, argon,
  helium, and others. They find that inactive gases behave similarly in their discharge,
  and they propose a new equation to describe the relationship between voltage, current
  density, and dark space length.
