revised_title: Spectroscopic Observations of Sunspots and Their Implications
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author conducts spectroscopic observations of sunspots to test theories
  about their formation and physical properties. The observations show that sunspot
  spectra have thicker absorption bands compared to the surrounding photosphere, suggesting
  that the phenomena of sunspots are not due to radiation from a source like the one
  proposed by M. Faye. This supports the absorption hypothesis and provides a possible
  solution to the problem of sunspot formation.
