revised_title: 'On the Capillary Phenomena of Jets: Experimental Observations and
  Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the capillary phenomena of jets, focusing on the effects
  of orifice geometry and pressure on jet formation and wave length. The study provides
  insights into the physics of fluid dynamics and jet formation, with implications
  for understanding everyday occurrences such as water falling from the lip of a vessel.
