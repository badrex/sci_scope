scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: Robert Lee's research on the ganglia and nerves of the virgin uterus reveals
  the existence of ganglia and nerve plexuses in the muscular coat of the uterus.
  He also found a striking analogy between the ganglia and nerves of the uterus and
  those of the heart, with the left side having more than double the size of the corresponding
  parts on the right side.
