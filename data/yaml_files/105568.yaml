tldr: In April 1764, a remarkable meteor was observed in Oxford. The luminous arch
  extended across the northern hemisphere, resembling an iris and emitting a bright
  white light. The meteor remained fixed and permanent for a short period before gradually
  decreasing and disappearing. This phenomenon has not been described in detail in
  any physiological papers before 1750.
