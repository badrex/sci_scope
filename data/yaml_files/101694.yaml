revised_title: Experiments on Animals in the Air-Pump and Observations on Lungs and
  Lung Function
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Respiration
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using an air-pump to study the effects of vacuum
  on various animals, including insects, birds, and mammals. They observe that the
  lungs of animals that have died in a vacuum sink in water, and discuss possible
  explanations for this phenomenon. They also explore the use of different materials
  for sealing air-pump receivers and describe experiments with boiling water and spirit
  of wine in a vacuum.
