scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Circulatory System
tldr: Sir Everard Home demonstrates that nerves accompanying arteries regulate their
  actions and influence blood supply to different parts of the body. He provides evidence
  through experiments on rabbits and a dog, showing the impact of nerve irritation
  on arterial dilatations and contractions.
