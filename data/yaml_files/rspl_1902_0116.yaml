scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: Sir William Crookes investigates the emanations of radium and discovers that
  they cause scintillations and phosphorescence on certain screens. He also observes
  that these emanations are attracted to elements with high atomic weight and density,
  leading to induced radioactivity.
