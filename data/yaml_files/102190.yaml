revised_title: Dr. Nath. Vincent's Solution to Dr. Papin's Water-Raising Engine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydraulic Engineering
tldr: Dr. Nath. Vincent investigates Dr. Papin's water-raising engine and proposes
  a solution using a vessel shaped like a pair of bellows, powered by clockwork, to
  circulate water and create jets. This design could potentially raise water a hundred
  or a thousand times, depending on the clockwork's mechanism.
