revised_title: The Influence of Phase Changes on the Tenacity of Ductile Metals at
  the Ordinary Temperature and at the Boiling Point of Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Mechanical Properties
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of phase changes on the tenacity of ductile
  metals at ordinary temperatures and the boiling point of liquid air. They find that
  changes in phase, from hard to soft and vice versa, are due to changes in temperature
  and mechanical deformation. The study helps establish clearer views on the relationship
  between phase changes and the tenacity of metals, contributing to a better understanding
  of molecular cohesion and mechanical properties.
