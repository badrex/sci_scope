tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the viscosity of liquids and
  their chemical nature, using various methods to measure viscosity coefficients and
  analyze the effects of temperature, pressure, and molecular composition on liquid
  flow.
topics:
- Viscosity
- Chemical Composition
- Physical Constants
- Liquid Flow
