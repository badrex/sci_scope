revised_title: Investigation of the Specific Heat of Metals at Different Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: This study investigates the specific heat capacity of various metals, including
  aluminum, iron, copper, zinc, silver, cadmium, tin, and lead, at different temperatures.
  The authors employed a unique experimental method to determine the specific heat
  capacity and found that the capacity varies with temperature for each metal.
topics:
- Thermal properties of materials
- Specific heat capacity
- Metals
- Temperature dependence
- Experimental methods
