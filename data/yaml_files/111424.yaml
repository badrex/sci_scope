tldr: The author, Frederick Currey, examines the fructification of certain Sphaeriaceous
  fungi, focusing on the diverse forms of their reproductive organs and their implications
  for systematic classification. He discusses various species and their unique characteristics,
  such as the presence of ascigerous and cytisporous states, curious modifications
  in ascus shape, and the existence of spermatia and stylospores.
