scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions &amp; Analysis
tldr: Richard Kirwan critiques Mr. Cavendish's experiments on air, specifically the
  role of fixed air in calcination processes. Kirwan argues that the decrease in respirable
  air during calcination is due to the conversion of dephlogisticated air into fixed
  air, rather than the production of water as Cavendish suggests.
