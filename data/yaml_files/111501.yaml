tldr: The author investigates the reaction between aniline and bichloride of carbon,
  resulting in the formation of a new aniline derivative. The compound is characterized
  as a triamine or a diamine, closely related to melaniline. Further research is planned
  to explore the behavior of aniline with other carbon chlorides.
