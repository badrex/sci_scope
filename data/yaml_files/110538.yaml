revised_title: Marsupial Brain Structure and Commissural Apparatus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: Richard Owen's study of the brain structure in marsupial animals reveals a unique
  commissural apparatus, which is different from that of placental mammals. This modification
  suggests a connection between the cerebral development and the reproductive system
  of marsupials, making them a distinct group within the mammalian class.
