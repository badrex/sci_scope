revised_title: The Influence of Bodily Labour on the Discharge of Nitrogen
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Nutrition
tldr: The author investigates the effect of physical labor on nitrogen discharge in
  the body, finding that bodily exercise causes an increase in nitrogen discharge
  during or immediately after labor. The study suggests that the immediate effect
  of labor may increase the discharge of nitrogen, but it remains uncertain whether
  this increase occurs at the expense of stored material or through a concomitant
  or subsequent increase in intake.
