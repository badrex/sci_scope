tldr: Dr. G. Gore investigates various phenomena of the capillary electroscope, examining
  the influence of different solutions, adhesion, and temperature on the movements
  of mercury. He concludes that the primary mechanical movement is due to a more or
  less charged electric state of the liquid surfaces, resulting in electric convection.
