revised_title: Errata in Paper on "Steady Motion and Small Vibrations of a Hollow
  Vortex"
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: This article presents corrections to a previous paper on the steady motion and
  small vibrations of a hollow vortex. It discusses the theory of vortex rings, their
  stability, and the effects of surface velocity on their motion. The author provides
  corrected equations and values for the times of vibration of hollow rings.
