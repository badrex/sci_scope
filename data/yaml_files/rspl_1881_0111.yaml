  Instrument for that Purpose
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author discusses the challenges of measuring the relative thermal intensity
  of the Sun and proposes a self-registering instrument to accurately measure shade
  and sun temperatures. The author also suggests using white paper as the most effective
  shading material and provides recommendations for uniform conditions to ensure accurate
  observations.
