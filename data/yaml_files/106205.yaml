scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The article describes the design and use of a portable wind gage invented by
  Dr. James Lind. The instrument measures wind force by observing the movement of
  water within two glass tubes connected by a siphon. The device can be used to compare
  the strength of different wind gusts and is particularly useful for measuring wind
  force at sea or in harsh weather conditions.
