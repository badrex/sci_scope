revised_title: On the Limit of Solar and Stellar Light in the Ultra-violet Part of
  the Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the limit of solar and stellar light in the ultra-violet
  part of the spectrum and finds that the absorption is due to the Earth's atmosphere
  rather than the sun's. The study uses photographs of Vega taken on the same plate
  with varying exposures to determine the limit of atmospheric absorption.
