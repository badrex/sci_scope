scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author, J. H. N. Hennessey, discovers white lines in the solar spectrum
  while studying atmospheric lines using a spectroscope belonging to the Royal Society.
  These white lines are not bright lines and are best seen around noon. They are found
  between K 1657*1 and K 1658*3, and the author is unable to account for their presence
  at such a high altitude.
