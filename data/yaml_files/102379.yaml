scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geomatics
tldr: The author demonstrates the errors that can occur in surveying when comparing
  surveys taken at different times due to the variation of the magnetic needle. He
  proposes a method to correct these errors by accounting for the magnetic variation
  in surveying.
