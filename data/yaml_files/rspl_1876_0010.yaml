revised_title: On Simultaneous Variations of the Barometer in India
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author investigates simultaneous variations of the barometer in India and
  finds that the current theories of aerial currents and vapor pressure cannot fully
  explain the observed phenomena. The author suggests that an additional cause, such
  as the attraction of gravitation, may be responsible for the barometric oscillations.
