revised_title: 'The Liquation of Gold and Platinum Alloys: Investigating the Redistribution
  of Metals During Cooling and Solidification'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the liquation of gold and platinum alloys, discovering
  that platinum concentrates towards the center of the alloy during cooling and solidification.
  This phenomenon affects the accuracy of assays taken from the outer portions of
  ingots, leading to potential errors in commercial transactions.
