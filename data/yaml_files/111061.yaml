revised_title: 'Gaseous Transformation of Water: A New Perspective on Water as a Simple
  Element'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author, M. Daniel Paret, presents an experiment that challenges the widely
  accepted idea of water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen. He claims that water
  can be transformed into oxygen or hydrogen without being decomposed, suggesting
  that it is a simple element generating these two substances through a gaseous transformation.
