scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: In this study, Sir H. Davy investigates the composition of phosphoric acid through
  various experiments, including burning phosphorus in a gaseous state in an excess
  of oxygen. He concludes that phosphoric acid is composed of approximately 100 parts
  phosphorus to 134.5 parts oxygen, and discusses the limitations of other methods
  used to determine the composition of phosphoric acid.
