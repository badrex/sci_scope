tldr: Everard Home investigates the spleen's role in absorbing fluids from the stomach.
  He conducts experiments using indigo, madder, and rhubarb to trace the fluid's path.
  The spleen is found to be turgid and contain molecules or vesicles of a white color.
  Fluids are found to pass from the stomach to the spleen, but the vessels responsible
  for conveying them remain undetected.
