revised_title: On the Relations Between the Viscosity (Internal Friction) of Liquids
  and their Chemical Nature - Part II
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the viscosity of liquids and
  their chemical composition, focusing on esters and ethers. They find that oxygen's
  influence on viscosity varies depending on its mode of association within the molecule,
  and provide experimental values for various esters and ethers.
topics:
- Viscosity
- Chemical composition
- Esters
- Ethers
- Organic substances
