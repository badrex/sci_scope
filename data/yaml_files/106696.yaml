revised_title: Exploring the Angle of Ocular Aberration in Human Vision
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the angle of ocular aberration in human vision and finds
  that it is compatible with the distinctness of our sight. The angle of aberration
  is significantly smaller than in refracting telescopes, allowing for imperceptible
  indistinctness in the eye.
