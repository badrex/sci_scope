revised_title: Improving Steam Engine Efficiency with Air-Enriched Steam
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Energy
tldr: Keane Fitzgerald experiments with Dr. Hales' method of distilling salt-water
  to improve steam engine efficiency. By blowing air through the steam, he increases
  the steam's strength and reduces fuel consumption. This method also helps maintain
  a consistent stroke length and water discharge, improving the overall performance
  of the steam engine.
