tldr: The authors demonstrate that vasoconstrictor nerve fibers can connect with peripheral
  vaso-dilator nerve cells, becoming vaso-dilator fibers. This shows that the mode
  of nerve ending of post-ganglionic nerve fibers determines whether contraction or
  inhibition of unstriated muscle in arteries occurs upon nerve stimulation.
