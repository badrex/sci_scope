revised_title: The Autonomy of the Heart's Rhythmic Motion
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the cause of the heart's rhythmic motion and concludes
  that it is an intrinsic property of the heart itself, not dependent on external
  nervous centers or blood flow. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the cause
  of the rhythm is located in the boundary-ring between the auricles and ventricle,
  and that the heart's muscular structure alone is not sufficient for maintaining
  rhythmic motion.
