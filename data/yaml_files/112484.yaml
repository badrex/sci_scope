tldr: A. W. Hofmann describes the synthesis of methylic aldehyde, a compound of the
  methyl-series, through the slow combustion of methylic alcohol using an incandescent
  platinum spiral. He also discusses its properties and derivatives, including the
  formation of a white crystalline substance with the composition of the sulphaldehyde
  of the methyl-series.
