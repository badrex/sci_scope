revised_title: Homology of the Head-Kidney in Birds and Amphibia
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The authors discuss the similarities between the development of the anterior
  part of the Mullerian duct in birds and the changes in the open extremity of the
  segmental duct in Amphibia, leading to the formation of the head-kidney. They also
  mention the presence of a peculiar body, the glomerulus, in both Amphibia and birds,
  suggesting a possible homologous structure.
