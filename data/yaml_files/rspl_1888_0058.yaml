tldr: The authors, Captain W. de W. Abney and Dr. T. E. Thorpe, conducted measurements
  of the photometric intensity of the coronal light during the solar eclipse of August
  28-29, 1886. They found that the total light of the corona during the 1886 eclipse
  was 0.0124 of a standard candle at a distance of 1 foot, and that the intensity
  of the light during the 1886 eclipse was almost exactly half of that of which would
  have been transmitted from a corona of the same intrinsic brightness when observed
  at Pike's Peak in 1878.
