tldr: The author presents a case study of a woman with a large ovarian tumor containing
  a four-month-old fetus. The tumor was located in the left ovary, which had burst,
  allowing the membranous sac containing the fetus to protrude into the abdomen. The
  growth of the fetus eventually caused the covering of the ovary to tear, leading
  to a fatal hemorrhage.
