revised_title: Experimental Analysis of Alternate Current Dynamo-Electric Machines
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering
tldr: The authors experimentally investigate the currents induced in the coils and
  cores of alternate current machines. They demonstrate that these currents affect
  the electromotive force of the machine and propose a method to determine the efficiency
  of such machines.
