tldr: The author investigates the inhibitive and fixation serum reactions in pulmonary
  tuberculosis and identifies factors that influence the interpretation of these reactions.
  They discuss the importance of controlling serum suspension and natural sheep-corpuscle
  amboceptor to obtain accurate results. The study also highlights the significance
  of using specific antigens to demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitive or fixation
  reactions.
