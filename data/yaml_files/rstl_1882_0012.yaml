revised_title: On the Refraction of Plane Polarized Light at the Surface of a Uniaxal
  Crystal
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The authors investigate the refraction of plane polarized light at the surface
  of a uniaxal crystal, using the electromagnetic theory to derive equations for the
  electric and magnetic displacements in the reflected and refracted waves. They describe
  an experimental method to test the theoretical formulae and discuss the challenges
  encountered in conducting the experiments.
