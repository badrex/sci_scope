revised_title: On the Residues of Powers of Numbers for Any Composite Modulus
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The authors investigate the residues of powers of numbers for any composite
  modulus, real or complex, and explore the relationships between exponents and the
  properties of these residues. They develop a series of propositions to determine
  the most general form of generators and provide examples of their applications.
