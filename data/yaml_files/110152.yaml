revised_title: Demonstration of Radiant Heat Permeability Through Transparent Screens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author, William Ritchie, conducts experiments to demonstrate that invisible
  radiant heat can pass through thin, transparent screens in the same manner as light.
  He uses various screens and setups to prove that the effect is not due to secondary
  radiation from the screen.
