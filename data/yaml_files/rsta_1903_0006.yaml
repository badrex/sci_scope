  of Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This paper investigates the process of metal fatigue and fracture under repeated
  alternations of stress using Swedish iron. The authors use a microscope to study
  the development of slip lines and cracks in the metal under stress, providing insight
  into the mechanisms of fatigue and potential methods for preventing metal failure.
