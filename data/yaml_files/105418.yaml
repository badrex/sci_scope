scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Geology
tldr: The author, Turberville Needham, describes the discovery of asbestos in a French
  forge and its properties. He explains that the asbestos is essentially calcined
  iron, and by adding phlogistic, it can be restored to its original state. The discovery
  of other geological features, such as lava and pumice stones, suggests that land
  may have been formed by subterranean fire.
