tldr: Robert Lee disputes the existence of a cellular structure in the human placenta
  and challenges the connection between the placenta and uterus through large arteries
  and veins. He concludes that the whole of the blood supplied to the uterus flows
  into the uterine veins and is returned to the mother's circulation without entering
  the placenta.
