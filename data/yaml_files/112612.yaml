tldr: This study examines the structure and composition of the fovea centralis, a
  small pit in the human retina. The research reveals that the fovea centralis is
  formed by the radial divergence of cone-fibers and the thinning of the inner retinal
  layers. The study also identifies the structures present at the center of the fovea,
  including the bacillary layer, outer limiting membrane, connective tissue, inner
  granule-layer, ganglionic layer, and the membrana limitans interna.
