revised_title: Chemical Composition of Mixed Herbage in Permanent Grass-Land and its
  Dependence on Manure and Plant Development
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Agriculture & Soil Science
tldr: This study investigates the chemical composition of mixed herbage in permanent
  grass-land and its dependence on manure and plant development. The authors found
  that the chemical composition is directly dependent on the seasons, supplies within
  the soil, and the description of plants encouraged, with significant differences
  in the botanical composition under different manuring conditions. The results show
  that the nitrogen assimilated by plants is connected to the composition of the ash,
  and that a large amount of nitrogen in chlorophyllous vegetation is derived from
  nitrates. The study provides valuable insights into the interpretation of the differences
  in the chemical composition of mixed herbage under various conditions.
