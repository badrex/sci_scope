revised_title: Improvements to the Cavendish Experiment for Measuring Gravitational
  Constant
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Gravitation
tldr: The author proposes improvements to the Cavendish experiment, including the
  use of quartz fibers for torsion, which can result in a smaller and more sensitive
  apparatus for measuring the gravitational constant.
