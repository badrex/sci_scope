revised_title: 'Researches in Physical Astronomy: Continued - Analyzing the Disturbing
  Function'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author continues his research in physical astronomy, focusing on the development
  of the disturbing function in celestial mechanics. He presents a method for expressing
  the coefficients of the inequalities corresponding to a given order in terms of
  the coefficients of the inferior orders, which can be used to analyze the effects
  of planetary perturbations on the motion of celestial bodies.
topics:
- Astronomy
- Lunar Theory
- Planetary Theory
- Disturbing Function
