revised_title: Electromotive Waves in Metals in Contact with Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive waves accompanying mechanical disturbance
  in metals in contact with electrolytes. The study demonstrates that molecular disturbance
  causes an electric disturbance, and the resulting effect on a galvanometer depends
  on the intensity, time, and molecular conditions of the disturbance.
