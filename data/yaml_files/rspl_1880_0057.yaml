scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Climatology
tldr: This article presents experiments conducted at Yvoire, Courmayeur, and the Col
  de Géant to study the effects of altitude on human respiration. The author investigates
  how altitude influences breathing rate, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production
  in two individuals. The results provide insights into the physiological changes
  that occur at high altitudes and the challenges faced by mountain climbers.
