revised_title: Quantitative Differences in Water-Conductivity of Deciduous Trees and
  Shrubs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: This study investigates the water-conductivity of deciduous trees and shrubs,
  comparing them to evergreen plants. The results show that deciduous trees have a
  higher specific conductivity and greater plasticity in their wood structure, which
  may contribute to their dominance in temperate zones. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding the variability and factors affecting wood structure
  for forestry and timber production.
