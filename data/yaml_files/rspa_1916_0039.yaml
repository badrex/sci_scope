revised_title: 'The Period of a Spherical Resonator with a Circular Aperture: A Further
  Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: The authors analyze the period of a spherical resonator with a circular aperture,
  focusing on the leakage through air spaces in magnetic shields and the behavior
  of iron under minimal magnetic force. They provide a more accurate approximation
  for the wave length of the fundamental aerial vibration of the resonator.
