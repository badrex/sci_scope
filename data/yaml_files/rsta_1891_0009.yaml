scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, specifically focusing on the magnetic induction and internal friction
  of nickel, cobalt, and iron. The study examines the effects of annealing, temperature
  changes, and other factors on the magnetic properties of these materials.
topics:
- Magnetic Induction
- Internal Friction
- Metallurgy
- Annealing
- Magnetic Properties of Materials
