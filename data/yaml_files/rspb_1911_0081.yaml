revised_title: Refractive Indices of Eye Media in Australian Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the refractive indices of the eye media in various Australian
  animals, finding that the indices are similar across different classes of animals.
  The study also highlights a unique phenomenon in sea-water Teleosts, which nearly
  approach the development of a 'negative eye.'
