revised_title: Comparing Magnetic Electrical Machines and Voltaic Batteries for Philosophical
  Research
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: William Sturgeon compares the effectiveness of magnetic electrical machines
  and voltaic batteries for use in philosophical research. He describes two forms
  of magnetic electrical machines and conducts experiments to determine their relative
  powers. Sturgeon also investigates the effects of different velocities of rotation
  and the impact of multiplying the channels of conduction on the instruments' performance.
