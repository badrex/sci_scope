scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates simultaneous invariants and eduction in binary forms,
  discovering a single irreducible invariant for rank 1 and four such invariants for
  rank 2. The theory of eduction is explored through various operators and applications,
  connecting it to the concept of functional invariants.
