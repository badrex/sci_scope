revised_title: Investigations into Inductive Action of Electric Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromagnetic Induction
tldr: Faraday investigates the inductive action of electric currents and the connection
  between this action and the direct transmission of electricity through conducting
  bodies. He discovers that a helix or an electromagnet can produce a powerful shock
  and a bright spark when the contact is broken, while an extended wire or a short
  wire does not exhibit these effects.
