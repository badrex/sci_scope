revised_title: 'Magnetic Disturbances and Terrestrial Galvanic Currents: A Comparative
  Study'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author compares magnetic disturbances recorded by self-registering magnetometers
  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with magnetic disturbances deduced from corresponding
  terrestrial galvanic currents recorded by self-registering galvanometers. The study
  reveals a general agreement between the curves of the two classes, suggesting that
  irregularities of magnetic force are caused by galvanic currents. However, some
  discordances are also observed and require further examination.
