revised_title: 'Impact with a Liquid Surface: A Study Using Instantaneous Photography'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics
tldr: This study uses instantaneous photography to analyze the impact of various objects
  on a liquid surface. The authors observe the formation of concentric ripples, the
  creation of bubbles, and the differences in disturbance caused by smooth, rough,
  or wet surfaces. The findings provide valuable insights into fluid motion and splash
  phenomena.
