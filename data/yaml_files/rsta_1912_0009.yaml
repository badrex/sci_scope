scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Number Theory
tldr: This article explores the theory of partitions of numbers, focusing on partitions
  in two-dimensional space and providing an adumbration of partitions in three-dimensional
  space. The author develops generating functions, lattice functions, and inner lattice
  functions to analyze these partitions and their associated functional equations.
topics:
- Number Theory
- Combinatorics
- Lattice Theory
- Partition Functions
- Mathematical Analysis
