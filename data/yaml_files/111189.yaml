scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: Thomas Huxley investigates the morphology and development of cephalous mollusks,
  specifically Heteropoda and Pteropoda, through anatomical and embryological analysis.
  He concludes that these mollusks represent two opposite phases of the modification
  of the molluscous archetype and that all cephalous Mollusca follow one or the other
  of these types.
