scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the upper partial tones of a pianoforte string struck
  at one-eighth of its length, confirming the existence of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th,
  9th, 10th, and 11th partials, and demonstrating the influence of the string's elasticity
  on the resulting sound.
