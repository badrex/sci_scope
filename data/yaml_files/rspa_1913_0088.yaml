revised_title: 'Electric Discharge Phenomena in Rotating Silica Bulbs: A Reexamination
  of Jervis Smith''s Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates electric discharge phenomena in rotating silica bulbs,
  repeating and expanding upon Jervis Smith's experiments. The study explores the
  effects of electrification, magnetic fields, and cathode rays on the luminosity
  and discharge within the bulbs, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying
  mechanisms.
