revised_title: Electrolytic Decomposition and Voltameter Efficiency
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the efficiency of a voltameter in electrolytic decomposition
  using platinum sponge plates and finds that an acting E.M.F. as high as 1 volt is
  not achievable, resulting in a total depreciation of energy. The economical production
  of currents by direct oxidation of combustible gases remains a challenging problem.
