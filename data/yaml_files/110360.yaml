revised_title: Magnetic Lines of Equal Variation and Their Changes on the Terrestrial
  Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Peter Barlow examines magnetic lines of equal variation and their changes on
  the Earth's surface, tracing them on a globe to better understand their patterns
  and dependencies. He finds that these lines follow definite and general laws, suggesting
  that they are not influenced by local factors and do not support the hypothesis
  of a specific plurality of magnetic poles.
