revised_title: Hamilton's Principal Function in Dynamics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Differential Equations & Analysis
tldr: Hamilton's essay expands on his general method for dynamics by introducing the
  concept of the Principal Function, which simplifies calculations in perturbation
  problems. He applies this method to problems of varying elements and demonstrates
  its effectiveness in solving the motions of a ternary or multiple system.
