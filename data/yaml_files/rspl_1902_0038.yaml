revised_title: Investigating Skin Currents in Humans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author examines skin currents in humans, finding that the normal current
  is always ingoing, and the normal response is always outgoing. The study also reveals
  that tetanization significantly reduces skin resistance, and that the response to
  excitation is greatly influenced by previous excitations.
