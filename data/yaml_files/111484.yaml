scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Gas Analysis
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring gases in analysis that allows
  for more accurate results with less effort and without the need for calculations.
  The method involves using a pressure tube and an eudiometer, which are adjusted
  to maintain the same pressure and temperature for the gas being analyzed.
