revised_title: On Poisson's Solution of Accurate Equations and General Solution of
  Partial Differential Equations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical & Theoretical Physics
tldr: The author investigates Poisson's solution of accurate equations applicable
  to sound transmission through a cylindrical tube and provides a general solution
  for partial differential equations. The study reveals that the equations are insoluble
  unless the velocity is expressed in terms of density alone, leading to a more accurate
  solution.
