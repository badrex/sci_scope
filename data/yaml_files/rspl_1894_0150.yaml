revised_title: The Spectral Analysis of Argon and Its Potential Composition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Atomic Theory
tldr: The author investigates the spectra of argon and discovers that it consists
  of sharp lines. The gas argon may be a mixture of at least two elements, one glowing
  red and the other blue, each having its distinctive spectrum. The findings suggest
  that argon may not be a simple body, but rather a combination of multiple elements.
