revised_title: 'The Diffusion of Ions into Gases: A Study of Conductivity and Recombination'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the diffusion of ions into gases and their conductivity,
  exploring the effects of recombination and electric forces on the process. The study
  provides a mathematical investigation of ion diffusion and a method to determine
  the diffusion coefficient of ions into a gas.
topics:
- Ion diffusion
- Gas conductivity
- Recombination
- Electric forces
- Diffusion coefficients
