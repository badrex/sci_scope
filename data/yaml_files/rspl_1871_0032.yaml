revised_title: Investigating a Possible Ultra-Solar Spectroscopic Phenomenon
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines a possible ultra-solar spectroscopic phenomenon during a
  lunar-solar eclipse and discovers that the residual twilight spectrum differs from
  the ordinary solar spectrum. The findings are compared to the coronal spectrum,
  which has implications for understanding the solar corona and its properties.
