revised_title: Analysis of Captain Back's Arctic Magnetic Observations
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie discusses Captain Back's magnetic observations made during
  his Arctic expedition. The author applies corrections for temperature differences
  and analyzes the results using various methods. The study concludes that the phenomena
  of terrestrial magnetic intensity are accurately represented in the Arctic region,
  but discrepancies exist when using Hansteen's method for areas with a high dip angle.
