revised_title: Further Investigation of the Spectrum of Silicium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author examines the spectrum of silicium using different methods and identifies
  various groups of silicium lines that are prominent in the spectra of hot stars.
  The study reveals the differences in the relative intensities of the lines in different
  spectra and their behavior at different stages of stellar temperature.
