revised_title: 'Oscillations of a Rotating Ellipsoidal Shell: Fluid Dynamics and Stability'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of a rotating ellipsoidal shell containing
  fluid, using Poincar√©'s analysis to determine the frequencies of these oscillations
  and the stability of the system. The study also explores the implications of a fluid
  interior for the Earth's oscillations and latitude variations.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Ellipsoidal Oscillations
- Dynamical Equations
- Stability Analysis
- Gyrostats
