tldr: The authors investigate the presence of chitin in the carapace of Pterygotus
  osiliensis, a fossil eurypterid from Silurian rocks of Oesel. They analyze the carapace's
  chemical composition and find evidence that it contains chitin, a substance also
  found in other invertebrates and fungi.
