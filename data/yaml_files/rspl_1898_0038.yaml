revised_title: Investigating the Electrical Response of Nerve to a Single Stimulus
  Using the Capillary Electrometer
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors, F. Gotch and G. J. Burch, successfully measure the electromotive
  changes in nerve response to a single stimulus using a capillary electrometer. They
  provide detailed descriptions of their experimental setup and findings, including
  the effects of different stimulus intensities and the role of the electrometer contacts'
  positions on the nerve.
