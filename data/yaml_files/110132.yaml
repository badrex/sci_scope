revised_title: Investigating Sun's Observed and Computed Right Ascensions
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author, James South, examines the discordances between the Sun's observed
  and computed right ascensions, using the Blackman-Street Observatory. He investigates
  whether these discrepancies originate from instrumental derangement and describes
  the seven-feet transit instrument used for the observations. South concludes that
  the observed right ascension is always in excess of the computed, and the cause
  may be imperfections in the solar tables.
