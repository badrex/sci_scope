tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the temperature change of high-pressure
  steam as it exited a small orifice. They found that for each pound of pressure difference,
  there was a cooling effect of 0.2 Centigrade. This demonstrated that the steam issued
  at a temperature above 100 degrees Centigrade and was dry, confirming the non-scalding
  property of steam from high-pressure boilers.
