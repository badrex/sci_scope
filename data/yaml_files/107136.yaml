revised_title: Muscular Arrangement and Blood Vessel Distribution in Slow-Moving Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of arteries in various slow-moving
  animals and observes a correlation between the slowness of muscular actions and
  the arrangement of blood vessels. This peculiar distribution is found in muscles
  that require long-lasting contractions, such as the cremasters, intercostal, and
  diaphragm muscles.
