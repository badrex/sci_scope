revised_title: 'On the Force Exerted on a Magnetic Particle by a Varying Electric
  Field: A Theoretical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the force exerted on a magnetic particle by a varying
  electric field, providing a theoretical analysis of the relationship between electric
  and magnetic forces. They find that the force on a magnetic particle is influenced
  by both the magnetic field and the mechanical force exerted by the electric field,
  with implications for the understanding of electromagnetic phenomena.
