revised_title: Investigating the Velocities of Ions in Dried Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This study examines the velocities of ions in dried gases, particularly hydrogen,
  and demonstrates the significant impact of even minute impurities on these velocities.
  The authors provide a range of results from various samples of dried hydrogen to
  illustrate this effect.
topics:
- Ion velocities
- Dried gases
- Gas impurities
- Ion mobility
- Gas purification
