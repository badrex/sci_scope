revised_title: Investigating the Sources of Nitrogen in Vegetation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors examine the sources of nitrogen in vegetation, specifically focusing
  on the question of whether plants assimilate free or uncombined nitrogen. They discuss
  the work of previous researchers and present their own experimental evidence, concluding
  that nitrogen is primarily derived from nitrogenous compounds in the soil and ammonia
  found in the atmosphere.
