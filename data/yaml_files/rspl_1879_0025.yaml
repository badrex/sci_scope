revised_title: 'The Motion of Two Spheres in a Fluid: Analyzing Fluid Dynamics and
  Sphere Interactions'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: This article investigates the motion of two spheres in a fluid, using the method
  of images and analyzing the kinetic energy of the motion. It explores the effects
  of sphere density, fluid displacement, and the attraction or repulsion between spheres
  based on their distance and relative densities.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Sphere Interactions
- Hydrodynamics
- Motion of Particles in Fluids
- Stokes' Law
