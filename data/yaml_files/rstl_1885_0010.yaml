revised_title: 'Experimental Researches in Magnetism: Hysteresis and Magnetization'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the effects of stress on magnetism and thermoelectric
  quality, discovering a phenomenon called hysteresis, where certain physical qualities
  lag behind changes in stress or other physical conditions. This research has implications
  for understanding the relationship between magnetization and magnetizing force.
topics:
- Magnetism
- Hysteresis
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Magnetic Retentiveness
- Magnetizing Force
