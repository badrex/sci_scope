scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: Henry Cavendish conducts experiments on factitious and inflammable air, generated
  by metallic substances like zinc, iron, and tin. He observes that the air produced
  is not affected by water or alcalies and can ignite when mixed with common air.
  He also discusses the phlogiston theory in relation to these experiments.
