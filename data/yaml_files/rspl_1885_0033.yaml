revised_title: A Novel Spectroscope Design for Comparative Analysis of Spectral Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author presents a new spectroscope design using a half-grating, allowing
  for convenient comparison of spectral lines C and F. This innovative approach enables
  the observation of different behaviors in metallic prominences and sunspots, expanding
  our understanding of solar phenomena.
