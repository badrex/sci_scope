scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: In this lecture, W.H. Bragg explains the method of investigating crystalline
  structure using X-rays and demonstrates how the atoms in a crystal are arranged
  in an orderly manner. He also discusses the significance of the angle between the
  rays and the crystal planes, known as Bragg's Law, in determining the reflection
  of radiation.
