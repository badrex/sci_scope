revised_title: The Influence of Gas and Pole Material on the Electrical Ignition of
  Gaseous Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the reaction between gas and pole material in the electrical
  ignition of gaseous mixtures. The author examines the effects of different metals
  and spark types on ignition, finding that the material of the poles significantly
  influences ignition, even with jump-sparks.
