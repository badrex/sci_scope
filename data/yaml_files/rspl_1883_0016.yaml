revised_title: Investigating Changes in Compass Deviations in Naval Ships and Atmospheric
  Absorption in the Infra-Red Solar Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The authors examine compass deviations in iron ships and their relation to magnetic
  latitude, finding that a large portion of the deviation is due to permanent magnetism
  in hard iron. They also investigate atmospheric absorption in the infra-red solar
  spectrum, observing various absorption lines and banded absorptions.
