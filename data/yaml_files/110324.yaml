tldr: Adair Crawford's paper discusses the insufficiency of existing theories that
  solely focus on solids, fluids, abstract life principles, physical or chemical agents,
  or the nervous and vascular systems to explain the phenomena of the living body
  in health and disease. Crawford argues that a comprehensive understanding of physiology
  and pathology requires considering all these factors and their respective influences.
