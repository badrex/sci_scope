revised_title: 'Inheritance of Wrinkledness and Roundness in Peas: Starch-Grain Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Plant Breeding
tldr: The author investigates the inheritance of roundness and wrinkledness in peas
  through a study of their starch-grains. They find that the starch-grains in F2 hybrid
  seeds are intermediate between those of round and wrinkled peas, providing insights
  into the segregation of these traits in subsequent generations.
