tldr: The British Consul at Canea, Crete, reports two earthquakes that occurred on
  September 19 and 20, 1867. The second shock was severe and caused damage to buildings
  and the death of two people. A remarkable phenomenon occurred where the sea receded
  and rose again, affecting the water temperature and causing damage to shipping.
  The copper-bottom of a ship became clean and bright, and the town's inhabitants
  fled to the country.
