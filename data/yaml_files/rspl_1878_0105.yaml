scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the solar spectrum and the spectra of various metallic
  elements, questioning the hypothesis that elements are simple bodies. He presents
  evidence for celestial dissociation and suggests that some elements may be compound
  bodies, with implications for solar and stellar physics.
