revised_title: Investigating the Critical Point of Pure Compounds and Mixtures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on benzene, ether, and a mixture of the two
  to study their behavior at high temperatures and pressures. The results reveal that
  the critical point phenomenon is influenced by molecular attraction and that it
  is possible to lower pressure without causing ebullition under certain conditions.
