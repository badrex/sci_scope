revised_title: The Effect of Oils on Camphor Motions on Water Surface
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Surface Science
tldr: The author investigates the effect of oils on the motion of camphor on the water
  surface and discovers that a chemically pure oil film can stop the camphor motion.
  The study also highlights the importance of chemical purity in understanding molecular
  interactions and developing theories.
topics:
- Surface Chemistry
- Camphor Motion
