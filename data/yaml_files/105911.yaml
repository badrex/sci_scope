tldr: Charles Mason conducted a series of astronomical observations at Cavan, Ireland,
  as appointed by the Royal Society. He measured equal altitudes of the Sun and stars,
  Zenith distances, and clock times to study the Earth's shape and the accuracy of
  timekeeping instruments. These observations contributed to the understanding of
  geodesy and celestial mechanics.
