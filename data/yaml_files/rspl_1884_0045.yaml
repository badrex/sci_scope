scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pulmonology & Respiratory Medicine
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using an artificial thorax to determine the
  origin of respiratory sounds. They find that the sounds heard over the trachea and
  lungs differ significantly, with vesicular breathing being distinct in the inner
  lung and bronchial breathing in the outer lung. The study sheds light on the production
  and characteristics of respiratory sounds.
