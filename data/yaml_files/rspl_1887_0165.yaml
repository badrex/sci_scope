revised_title: A Study of Functional Invariants and their Properties
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The authors explore a class of functional invariants, which are combinations
  of partial coefficients of a function with multiple variables. They establish properties
  of these invariants, including their rank and the number of invariants for each
  rank. The study also covers the theory of eduction and its connection to binary
  forms and functionals.
