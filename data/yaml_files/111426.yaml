tldr: The author investigates the role of the spinal cord in transmitting sensations
  and voluntary movements. They find that the lateral columns of the spinal cord,
  near the medulla oblongata, are the primary channels for voluntary movements, while
  the anterior columns and gray matter are responsible for voluntary movements in
  the lower regions of the spinal cord. Additionally, the author discovers that the
  anterior columns contain a thin layer of fibers responsible for transmitting sensitive
  impressions, which are not sensitive to pain.
