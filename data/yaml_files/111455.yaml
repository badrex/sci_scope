  Joint Surfaces, and Faults'

tldr: The author examines the physical structure of the Old Red Sandstone in County
  Waterford, focusing on cleavage, joint surfaces, and faults. He identifies two systems
  of conjugate faults and four systems of joint and cleavage planes, which he believes
  indicate distinct systems of upheaving force. The study supports the mechanical
  theory of slaty cleavage.
