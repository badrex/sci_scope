revised_title: Investigation of Electrochemical Equivalent of Silver and Respiration
  in Myriapoda
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electrochemical equivalent of silver and discovers
  that the true value is probably not far from the previously given value by Lord
  Rayleigh. Additionally, a new mode of respiration in Myriapoda is observed, and
  a study on the ginger-beer plant and its organisms is conducted, contributing to
  the understanding of fermentation yeasts and bacteria.
