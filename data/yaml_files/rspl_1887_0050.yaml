revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Polish on the Reflexion of Light from the
  Surface of Iceland Spar
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of polish on the reflection of light from
  the surface of Iceland spar using a Nicol and a quarter wave plate arrangement.
  They find that the angle of incidence of polarized light falling on the crystal
  surface remains constant, allowing for a direct measurement of the alteration produced
  by a change in polish.
