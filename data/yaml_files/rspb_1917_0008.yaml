revised_title: 'The Effect of Auxin on Lemna minor Growth: An Application of the Theory
  of Probabilities'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of auxin on the growth of Lemna minor plants
  using the theory of probabilities. They find that plants supplied with increasing
  amounts of auxin show improved health and growth, suggesting that auxin may act
  as an organic nutrient or accessory food substance.
