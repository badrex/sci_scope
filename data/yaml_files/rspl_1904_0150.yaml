revised_title: Comparison of Platinum and Hydrogen Scales of Temperature
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors compare the platinum and hydrogen scales of temperature between
  -444°C and -190°C, finding that the deviation from Callendar's parabolic formula
  becomes significant even at -190°C. They also discuss the use of solid carbonic
  acid, ether, and methylated spirit as a means of maintaining constant temperatures.
topics:
- Temperature Scales
- Platinum Thermometers
- Hydrogen Thermometers
- Low Temperature Measurements
- Temperature Calibration
