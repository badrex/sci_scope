revised_title: Experiments on Substances Resisting Putrefaction and the Role of Alkaline
  Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on substances that resist putrefaction and discovers
  that volatile alkaline salts, such as hartshorn, have antiseptic properties and
  can prevent putrefaction in animal substances. This finding suggests that these
  salts may be useful in medical applications to prevent the corruption of bodily
  humors.
