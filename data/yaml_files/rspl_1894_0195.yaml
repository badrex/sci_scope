tldr: The authors discover that Kaloxylon, previously believed to be an independent
  plant, is actually the root of Lyginodendron Oldhamium. They provide evidence of
  its structure and mode of origin, confirming it as an adventitious root. This finding
  completes the understanding of Lyginodendron's vegetative organs.
