  and Concussion-Induced Movements'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the structural features of certain
  leaves and the phenomena of nyctitropism and movements caused by concussion. The
  study focuses on the contractile organs and their structural arrangements, which
  facilitate the redistribution of fluids in the tissues, influencing the extent and
  rapidity of the movements. The findings suggest that the structural features play
  a crucial role in determining the occurrence and characteristics of these movements.
