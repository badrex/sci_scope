revised_title: The Ultimate Distribution of Air-Passages and Air-Cells in Lungs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of air-passages and the formation of
  air-cells in the lungs using microscopy. He concludes that bronchial tubes terminate
  in branched air-passages and air-cells that freely communicate with each other,
  with no anastomoses between interlobular branches.
