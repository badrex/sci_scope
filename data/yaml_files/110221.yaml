revised_title: On the Laws of Polarization of Light by Refraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: David Brewster investigates the laws of polarization of light by refraction
  and finds that the quantity of light polarized by refraction is not equal to the
  whole of the transmitted pencil, and refraction cannot produce rays truly polarized.
  He also deduces the law expressing the variation of the rotation corresponding to
  the deviation of the refracted ray.
