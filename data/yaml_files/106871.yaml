scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author presents a method for determining the longitudes of Dunkirk and Paris
  from Greenwich using triangular measurement in 1787 and 1788, supposing the Earth
  to be an ellipsoid. The study aims to reconcile the results with the measured arc
  between the meridians of Greenwich and Paris and to compare the conclusions with
  the ratio of the axes assigned by Sir Isaac Newton.
