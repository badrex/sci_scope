revised_title: On the Origin of the Parallel Roads of Lochaber and their Bearing on
  Other Phenomena of the Glacial Period
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geomorphology
tldr: The author examines the origin of the parallel roads of Lochaber and their connection
  to the glacial period. They discuss various theories, including the detrital and
  marine theories, and ultimately support the glacial theory of Agassiz. The author
  argues that glaciers could explain the formation of the parallel roads and the lakes
  in the region, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the geological history
  of the area.
