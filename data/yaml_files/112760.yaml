revised_title: Supra-Annual Temperature Cycles in Earth's Surface-Crust
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Climate Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author analyzes temperature data from 1837 to 1869 collected from thermometers
  sunk into the Earth's surface at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. He identifies
  three supra-annual temperature cycles, with the most prominent having a period of
  11 years, similar to Schwabe's solar spot groups. Although solar spots cannot be
  the cause of these temperature variations, the author suggests possible explanations
  and discusses practical applications of understanding these cycles.
