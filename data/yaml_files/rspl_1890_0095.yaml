revised_title: A Unique Excretory Organ System in an Oligocheetous Annelid
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: The author discovers a unique excretory organ system in an oligocheetous annelid,
  consisting of a network of canals in the body wall, which suggests a comparison
  with the Nematoidea. This system is distinct from the typical nephridial systems
  found in other oligochaeta and may provide insights into annelid excretory organ
  evolution.
