scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: This article discusses the results of hourly observations of the magnetic declination
  made by Sir Francis Leopold McClintock and the officers of the yacht 'Fox' at Port
  Kennedy in the Arctic Sea during the winter of 1858-59. The findings are compared
  with those obtained by Captain Rochfort Maguire and the officers of Her Majesty's
  Ship 'Plover' in 1852, 1853, and 1854 at Point Barrow. The study aims to understand
  the periodical laws of magnetic disturbances at different locations and their impact
  on geographical physics.
