scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering
tldr: The author presents a graphical method for calculating trajectories of high-angle
  fire, taking into account the variation of air density along the trajectory. The
  method involves constructing time-velocity and time-distance curves, and applying
  step-by-step calculations to determine the trajectory's elements, such as vertical
  and horizontal velocities, time-intervals, and direction.
