revised_title: Improvements in Safety-Lamp Apparatus for Gas-Testing
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Instrumentation
tldr: The authors present an improved apparatus for testing the sensitivity of safety-lamps
  when used for gas-testing. The new design allows for faster and more accurate replacement
  of the chamber's atmosphere, leading to more reliable results. The authors also
  discuss the use of a hydrogen flame in an ordinary safety-lamp for detecting and
  measuring firedamp.
