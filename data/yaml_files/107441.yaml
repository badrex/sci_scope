revised_title: Effects of Temperature on Glass and Polarized Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effects of temperature on glass and its impact on
  polarized light. He discovers that glass heated to a certain temperature can depolarize
  light and form images, similar to crystallized bodies. The phenomenon is further
  studied using glass tears, revealing the structure of crystallized bodies and providing
  insights into the double refraction problem.
