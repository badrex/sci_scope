scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Anatomy
tldr: Malpighi's research focuses on the structure and function of the brain and tongue.
  He discovers that the exterior part of the brain is inserted into the Corpus callosum
  and that the brain's use is different from previous assumptions. Malpighi also examines
  the optic nerve in various animals, finding that fish have a unique structure compared
  to terrestrial animals. Lastly, he identifies papillary eminences in the tongue,
  which he believes are the primary organ of taste.
