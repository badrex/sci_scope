revised_title: The Molecular Field in Diamagnetic Substances and its Influence on
  Magnetic Susceptibility
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular constitution and temperature
  on magnetic susceptibility in diamagnetic substances. They suggest that the local
  molecular field in these substances is comparable to the ferromagnetic molecular
  field and estimate its intensity to be around 107 gauss. This field is responsible
  for the distortion of molecules and the alteration of the periods of vibration of
  electrons within them.
