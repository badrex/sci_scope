revised_title: Artificial Formation of Alkaloids from Nitrogenous Principles of Vegetables
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the possibility of synthesizing alkaloids from nitrogenous
  principles found in vegetables. By distilling various plant materials, such as beans
  and oil-cake, the author successfully isolates a series of organic bases with properties
  similar to known alkaloids. These bases, however, are different from those obtained
  from bones or coal and do not contain aniline.
