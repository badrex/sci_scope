revised_title: A Novel Portable Ophthalmometer for Measuring Corneal Curvature
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ophthalmology & Optometry
tldr: The authors present a portable ophthalmometer designed to measure the curvature
  of the cornea, providing essential data for the assessment and measurement of corneal
  astigmatism. The instrument uses a combination of a convex lens, a prism, and a
  telescope to create a virtual image of the cornea, allowing for accurate measurements.
