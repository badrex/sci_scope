tldr: Joule investigates the surface-condensation of steam and the conductivity of
  tubes under varied circumstances. He concludes that the resistance to conductivity
  is mainly due to the water film in contact with the tube surfaces, and that the
  conductivity increases with the speed of the water stream.
