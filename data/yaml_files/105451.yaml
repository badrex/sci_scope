revised_title: An Investigation into the Buoyancy of Cork in Different Waters
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydrodynamics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the specific buoyancy
  of cork in different waters, comparing the weights and buoyancy of salt water and
  fresh water. The results show that salt water provides more buoyancy to cork than
  fresh water, and that the buoyancy is affected by the temperature and duration of
  immersion.
