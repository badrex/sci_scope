revised_title: Electro-Magnetic Gyroscope and its Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents an apparatus that creates a continuous rotation movement
  using electro-magnetic reactions. The device can be used with various moveable iron
  pieces and magnets, and the rotation direction can be altered by changing the position
  of the magnets. The author explains the phenomena using Faraday's laws of induction
  and suggests that the device could potentially be a source of motive power.
