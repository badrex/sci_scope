revised_title: Investigation of Fluid Flow Through Pipes with Diverging and Converging
  Boundaries
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The authors experimentally investigate the flow of water through pipes with
  converging and diverging boundaries, focusing on the loss of head and the effect
  of angle of divergence. They find that the loss of head is influenced by the angle
  of divergence and the type of pipe, with circular pipes showing a more consistent
  loss of head compared to square pipes.
