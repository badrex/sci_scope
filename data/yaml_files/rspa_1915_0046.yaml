revised_title: The Influence of Gases on Electron and Ion Emission from Hot Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the impact of various gases on the emission of electrons
  and ions from hot metals, discovering a linear relationship between the changes
  in constants A and n and the pressure of the surrounding gas. This relationship
  holds for both electron and ion emission and is independent of the specific gas
  used, suggesting a general law governing the phenomenon.
topics:
- Electron Emission
- Ion Emission
- Gas Effects on Emission
- Thermodynamics of Electron Emission
- Contaminated Surfaces
