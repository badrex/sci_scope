revised_title: Investigating Heat Dissipation by a Platinum Surface at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the heat dissipation properties of a platinum surface
  at high temperatures using a platinum wire as both a radiator and thermometer. They
  find that the emissivity of a bright platinum surface in various gases, such as
  air, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, varies and is influenced by the pressure
  and temperature of the gases.
