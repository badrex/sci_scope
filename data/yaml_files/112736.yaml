scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Structural Mechanics
tldr: The author proposes a simplified method for teaching Mr. Heppel's theory of
  continuous beams, while acknowledging its potential for practical use and further
  scientific study. He tests the accuracy of his formulae using the theorem of three
  moments and finds agreement with Mr. Heppel's original method.
