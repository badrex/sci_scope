revised_title: Investigating the Sun's Influence on Electrical Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author, John Goodman, conducts experiments using a galvanometer to study
  the effects of sunlight on electrical currents. He finds that the sun's rays cause
  a current to flow in the helix of the instrument, and that this current is influenced
  by the angle of the sun's rays and the position of the helix. Goodman concludes
  that these results support the idea of a universal force that is modified by varying
  conditions.
