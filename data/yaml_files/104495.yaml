revised_title: Investigating the Specific Gravity of Diamonds
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Gemology
tldr: John Ellicot investigates the specific gravity of diamonds and finds that the
  previously published values may not be accurate. He conducts experiments with various
  diamonds and concludes that the specific gravity of diamonds does not differ significantly,
  debunking earlier claims.
