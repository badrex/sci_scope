scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The author, Mr. William Arderon, shares his observation of eels ascending perpendicular
  flood-gates and posts at a waterworks in Norwich. He speculates that eels use their
  glutinous body matter to support their weight as they climb, and that this behavior
  supports Dr. Plot's historical account of eels' nocturnal migration across meadows.
