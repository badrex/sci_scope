revised_title: A Study of the Eutectoid Transition Point in Carbon Steels
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Steel
tldr: This study investigates the thermomagnetic properties of various carbon steels,
  focusing on the eutectoid transition point where the material changes from a homogeneous
  to a heterogeneous mixture of iron and carbide. The research reveals that the sudden
  loss of magnetism occurs at the same temperature for all steels, suggesting that
  the eutectoid patches have a consistent composition and that this temperature is
  the true transition point.
