scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Pathology & Mycology
tldr: The author discovers a previously unnoticed patch of hyphae in the seed of Lolium
  temulentum, which plays a crucial role in the plant's infection and growth. This
  finding suggests a symbiotic relationship between the plant and the fungus, with
  potential implications for understanding plant-fungus interactions and the development
  of symbiotic theories.
