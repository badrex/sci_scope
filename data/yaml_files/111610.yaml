scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Parasitology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of parasitic fungi in the hard structures
  of various animals, including sponges, foraminifera, corals, bivalves, and gastropods.
  The fungi were found to be unicellular and have significant implications for zoologists
  and botanists alike. The author also discusses the potential physiological effects
  of these parasites on their host animals.
