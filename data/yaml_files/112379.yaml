revised_title: Cayley's Memoir on Cubic Surfaces and Reciprocal Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: In this memoir, Cayley investigates the properties of cubic surfaces and their
  reciprocal surfaces, extending Dr. Salmon's theory of reciprocal surfaces to better
  understand the nature of singularities and the classification of these surfaces.
topics:
- Cubic Surfaces
- Geometry
- Algebraic Geometry
- Reciprocal Surfaces
- Singularity Theory
