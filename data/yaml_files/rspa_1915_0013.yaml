revised_title: 'Electric Waves Transmission Over Earth''s Surface: Analyzing Resistance
  and Curvature Effects'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Waves
tldr: The author presents an analytical solution for electric wave transmission over
  the Earth's surface, considering the effects of resistance and curvature. The study
  confirms previous findings on wave propagation and suggests that the diffraction
  theory can explain recorded experiments when considering daylight observations at
  great distances.
