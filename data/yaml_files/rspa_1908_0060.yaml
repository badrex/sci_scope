revised_title: On the Surface Tension and Internal Energy of Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between surface tension and internal
  energy in various liquids, finding that surface tension tends to decrease near the
  critical point, while internal energy remains a more fundamental quantity in understanding
  capillary phenomena.
topics:
- Surface Tension
- Internal Energy
- Capillarity
- Thermodynamics
- Phase Transitions
