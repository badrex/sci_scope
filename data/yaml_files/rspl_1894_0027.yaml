revised_title: On the Relations between Viscosity and Chemical Nature of Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the viscosity of liquids and
  their chemical nature, finding that molecular weight, temperature, and chemical
  composition significantly affect viscosity. They propose a method for comparing
  liquids based on molecular area and discuss the implications of their findings for
  understanding the physical properties of liquids.
