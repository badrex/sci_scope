revised_title: Determination of the Velocity of Negative Ions in Flames
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of negative ions in flames using two experimental
  methods. They find that the velocity of negative ions in flames is approximately
  10,000 cm per second, suggesting that these ions are likely electrons. This research
  provides insights into the nature of electrical conductivity in flames and the behavior
  of ions within them.
