  in Water
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the shape and sound produced by a cavity formed when
  a sphere falls into water. The study focuses on the relationship between the shape
  of the cavity, the depth of the sphere, and the resulting sound. The research provides
  insight into the physics of underwater acoustics and fluid dynamics.
