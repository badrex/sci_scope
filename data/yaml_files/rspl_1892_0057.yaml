revised_title: Influence of Magnetisation on the Corrosion of Steel
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion
tldr: The author investigates the influence of magnetisation on the corrosion of steel
  using a solution of cupric chloride. The results indicate that magnetisation has
  a small effect on the extent of the corrosive action, possibly due to local currents
  induced by magnetisation between the polar and central portions of the steel bars.
