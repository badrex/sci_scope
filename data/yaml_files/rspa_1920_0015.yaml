revised_title: Investigation of the Viscosity of Liquid Sulphur
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the viscosity of liquid sulphur using the rotating cylinder
  method and find that the viscosity is highly dependent on temperature, with significant
  variations in values at different temperatures and with different samples. The results
  suggest that the viscosity of sulphur is a sensitive method for noting changes in
  its physical properties.
