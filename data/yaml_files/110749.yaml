revised_title: Non-Vascularity of Certain Animal Tissues and Their Nutrition
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author investigates the non-vascular nature of certain animal tissues and
  demonstrates their unique mode of organization and nutrition. Through detailed examinations
  of articular cartilage, fibro-cartilage, the cornea, crystalline lens, and epidermoid
  appendages, the study reveals that these tissues can be nourished without the presence
  of blood vessels, and that their nutrition is achieved through a different process
  than vascular tissues.
