revised_title: Temperature and Time Effects on Dielectric Capacity and Residual Charge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Dielectric Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of temperature and time on the capacity
  and residual charge of dielectrics, specifically window glass and ice. They find
  that for glass, residual charge diminishes with rising temperature for long times,
  but increases for short times. The capacity of glass increases with temperature
  for ordinary durations but remains constant for short periods. The capacity of ice
  increases with both temperature and time, and the conductivity of glass is observed
  to be higher after shorter times of electrification.
