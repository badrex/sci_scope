revised_title: An Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Sound
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author, E. J. Stone, conducts an experiment to determine the velocity of
  sound by measuring the time interval between the sound reaching two observers and
  the arrival of a galvanic current at the Royal Observatory. The observed velocity
  of sound is found to be 1090.6 feet per second, with a coefficient of elasticity
  of air under constant volume as an unknown quantity.
