revised_title: Determination of Ionic Velocities in Air at Different Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author investigates the velocity of ions produced by Rontgen rays in air
  at different temperatures using Langevin's method. The results show that at temperatures
  between -183°C and -160°C, the velocities of both positive and negative ions are
  nearly directly proportional to the absolute temperature, but at -160°C, the velocities
  are equal and smaller than expected from the linear relationship.
