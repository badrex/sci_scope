revised_title: The Decomposition of Homogeneous Liquids and the Evolution of Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the conditions and factors affecting the rate of gas
  evolution from homogeneous liquids, focusing on the decomposition of ammonium nitrate,
  potassium chlorate, and hydrogen peroxide. They explore the effects of varying pressure,
  temperature, and the presence of catalysts on the rate of these chemical reactions.
