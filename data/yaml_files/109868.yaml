revised_title: 'Experiments on the Torpedo Electricus: Investigating the Electrical
  Organs and Nerves'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Nervous System
tldr: John T. Todd conducts experiments on the Torpedo electricus to determine if
  the fish has the ability to excite or interrupt its electrical organs independently
  of the large nerve system. He found that the fish's electrical shocks remained potent
  even after various surgical procedures, suggesting that the electrical organs and
  nerves function independently.
