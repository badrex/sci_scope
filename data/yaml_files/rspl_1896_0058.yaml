revised_title: Effects of Temperature on Electrotonic Currents in Medullated Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of temperature on electrotonic currents
  in medullated nerve, finding that a rise in temperature temporarily diminishes or
  abolishes ordinary electrotonic currents, while a fall in temperature increases
  the A and K currents. The study provides insights into the relationship between
  temperature and nerve conduction.
