revised_title: On the Liquefied Hydrides of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and the Halogens
  as Conducting Solvents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The authors investigate the liquefied hydrides of phosphorus, sulphur, and halogens
  to determine their conducting solvent properties and potential for forming electrically
  conducting solutions. They measure physical constants, molecular surface energy,
  and viscosity, and discuss the solubilities and conductivities of various substances
  in these hydrides.
topics:
- Hydrides
- Conducting Solvents
- Ionic Dissociation
- Physical Constants
- Molecular Surface Energy
