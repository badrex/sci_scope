revised_title: The Role of Enzymes in Carbon Assimilation and Oxygen Evolution in
  Green Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the mechanism of carbon assimilation in green plants,
  focusing on the role of enzymes in the decomposition of carbon dioxide and the evolution
  of oxygen. The authors discover a catalyzing enzyme that localizes to the chloroplasts
  and is responsible for the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, leading to
  oxygen release. This enzyme is found in various plant species and appears to be
  associated with amyloplasts, whether they contain chlorophyll or not.
