scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ichthyology & Marine Biology
tldr: The author, William Barlow, describes the discovery of a Sun-fish, also known
  as Mola Salu, and its unique properties. The fish's flesh is hard and firm, resembling
  a gristly substance, and when boiled, turns into a jelly-like substance. Barlow
  recommends further experimentation with the Sun-fish's flesh due to its glutinous
  nature, suggesting potential uses in adhesives and other applications.
