revised_title: The Mechanism of Parasitism in Pseudomonas Destructans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Pathogenics
tldr: The author investigates the parasitic behavior of Pseudomonas destructans, a
  bacterium that causes a bacterial disease in turnips. The study reveals that the
  bacterium secretes a powerful cytase and toxin, which destroy living plant cells,
  and has the ability to penetrate the cell wall and enter the cell cavity. This makes
  it a true plant pathogen, causing damage to the turnip by attacking its cells and
  spreading through the plant tissue.
