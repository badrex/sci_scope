scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of the Britannia and Conway
  Tubular Iron Bridges, focusing on the impact of the iron's tremor and the influence
  of external magnetic forces. The study examines the magnetic direction, magnitude
  of horizontal and vertical forces, and the susceptibility of the iron to induced
  magnetism.
