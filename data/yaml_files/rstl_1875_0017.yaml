revised_title: On a Class of Identical Relations in the Theory of Elliptic Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates certain forms of series for primary elliptic functions
  and discusses the algebraic identities that arise from them. The study involves
  the transformation of these functions using Fourier's theorem and the application
  of mathematical transformations to elliptic and theta-function relations.
