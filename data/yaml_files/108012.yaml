revised_title: Experimental Researches on Electrochemical Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: Faraday investigates the effects of electric currents on electrochemical decomposition,
  demonstrating that a single pole can cause decomposition and that the air can act
  as a pole in the process. He also shows that the direction of the electric current
  influences the resulting decomposition.
