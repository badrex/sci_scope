revised_title: Development of Spinal Nerves in Elasmobranch Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author examines the development of spinal nerves in elasmobranch fishes,
  specifically Scylium, Pristiurus, and Torpedo, and finds that the posterior and
  anterior roots of the spinal nerves arise as independent outgrowths from the neural
  canal. The author also speculates on the implications of these findings for various
  physiological and morphological problems.
