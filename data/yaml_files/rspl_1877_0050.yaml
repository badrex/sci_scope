revised_title: Bromination of Normal Paraffins and Their Substitution Products
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author examines the action of bromine on normal paraffins, specifically
  hexane and heptane, and finds that only secondary bromides are formed, with no primary
  bromides. The study also reveals the formation of other non-volatile products, which
  may be olefines, and the author plans to further investigate their nature.
