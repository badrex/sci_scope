revised_title: Investigation of Storage Battery Chemistry and Lead Salt Formation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemistry of storage batteries, focusing on the
  reactions occurring during charging and discharging. They discover that the lead
  sulfate formed and decomposed in the cell is not the ordinary white sulfate, but
  rather two different lead salts. The author presents equations for the electrolytic
  reactions taking place in the cell, depending on the active material of the battery
  plates.
