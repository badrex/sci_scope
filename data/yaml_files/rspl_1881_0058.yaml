revised_title: 'A Torsion Gravimeter: Design and Historical Review'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author examines a torsion gravimeter designed by J. Allan Broun and discusses
  its historical context, design, and potential improvements. The instrument aims
  to measure small variations in gravity using the principle of statical gravimetry
  and has implications for understanding the Earth's structure and geophysics.
