revised_title: Investigating the Heat of the Moon and Stars using the Radio-Micrometer
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author develops a new method using the radio-micrometer to measure the heat
  of celestial bodies, such as the Moon and stars, with greater sensitivity and accuracy
  than previous methods. The radio-micrometer offers advantages over thermopiles and
  galvanometers, as it is less affected by magnetism and external temperature changes,
  and provides faster measurements.
