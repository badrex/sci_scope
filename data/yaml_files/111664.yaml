revised_title: Volumetric Relations of Ozone and the Action of Electrical Discharge
  on Oxygen and other Gases
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors, Thomas Andrews and P.G. Tait, investigate the volumetric changes
  that occur when ozone is formed from pure oxygen through electrical discharge. They
  find that the condensation is much greater than previously thought, suggesting that
  ozone's density is more similar to a solid or liquid than a gas. They also study
  the effects of electrical discharge on other gases, such as hydrogen, nitrogen,
  and carbonic oxide, and their findings have implications for further research in
  the field.
