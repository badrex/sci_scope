revised_title: 'The Influence of Timbre and Loudness on the Localisation of Sounds:
  A Study of Sound Perception and Its Relation to Laterality and Incidence'
scientific_discipline: Psychology
scientific_subdiscipline: Cognitive & Sensory Psychology
tldr: The study investigates the influence of timbre and loudness on the localization
  of sounds, demonstrating that variations in timbre significantly affect our perception
  of sound incidence, while binaural differences in intensity determine laterality.
  The findings suggest that our awareness of sound position is dependent on both timbre
  and loudness variations.
