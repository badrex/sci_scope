revised_title: Improving Zenith Telescope Observations with a New Method
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astroinstrumentation & Observational Techniques
tldr: The author proposes a new method for using the zenith telescope to measure the
  zenith distances of stars with greater precision. This method involves observing
  two stars with similar zenith distances and using their angular distance to calculate
  the difference in their zenith distances. This technique can help account for changes
  in the position of stars due to aberration, nutation, and other factors.
