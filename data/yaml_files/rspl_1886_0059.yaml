revised_title: A General Theorem in Electrostatic Induction and its Application to
  the Origin of Electrification by Friction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author investigates the electrification of a dielectric when brought into
  an electric field and its specific inductive capacity is altered. The study reveals
  a general theorem in electrostatic induction, which sheds light on the origin of
  electrification by friction.
