revised_title: 'The Validity of Microchemical Tests for Oxygen Places in Tissues:
  A Critical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: This study investigates the validity of microchemical tests, specifically the
  rongalit white test, for identifying oxygen places in tissues. The author conducts
  experiments with silk and sand, demonstrating that staining occurs independently
  of the presence of oxygen, challenging the basis of Unna's work on staining and
  oxidation in cells.
