revised_title: Investigating the Ascent of Sap in Trees and its Nutrient Channels
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the ascent of sap in trees and discovers that
  it descends from the young branches and leaves through the bark. He identifies the
  central vessels as the channels of communication for the nutrient-rich sap and explains
  the role of the medulla as a reservoir of moisture for leaves and fruits.
