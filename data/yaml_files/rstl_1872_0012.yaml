revised_title: 'On the Contact of Surfaces: A Study of Surface Geometry and Contact'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the contact of surfaces at a point and examines the
  conditions for contact of various degrees, including two-pointic, three-pointic,
  and four-pointic contact. The study focuses on the geometry and mathematical analysis
  of surfaces and their intersection, providing insights into the properties of surfaces
  and their contact points.
