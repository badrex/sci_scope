scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author, Robert Smith, discusses the decomposition and analysis of ammonia
  and cyanogen compounds using chlorine compounds. He describes a method for estimating
  the quantity of ammonia in a solution and the decomposition of hydrocyanic acid
  and its compounds. Additionally, he explores the use of hypochlorites and chloride
  of lime for the decomposition of uric acid and as a method for estimating nitrogen
  in urine.
