revised_title: Chemotaxis and the Origin of Parasitism in Fungi
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Pathology & Microbiology
tldr: The author investigates the role of chemotaxis in the parasitic relationship
  between fungi and their host plants. They demonstrate that certain substances, such
  as saccharose, glucose, and asparagin, attract fungal germ-tubes, while others,
  like organic acids and alkaloids, repel them. This suggests that chemotaxis plays
  a significant role in the parasitic behavior of fungi.
