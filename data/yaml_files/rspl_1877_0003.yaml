revised_title: Protoplasmic Filament Protrusion and Contraction in Teasel Glandular
  Hairs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates protoplasmic filaments protruding from the glandular
  hairs of the common teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris) and observes their contraction
  in response to various stimuli. The protrusion and contraction of these filaments
  are hypothesized to be related to the plant's absorption of nitrogenous matter and
  may be connected to the plant's adaptation for capturing insects.
