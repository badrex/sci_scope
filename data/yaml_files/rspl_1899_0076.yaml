revised_title: Temperature Dependence of Argon Viscosity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Rheology
tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the viscosity of argon
  gas, finding that it behaves as if composed of single atoms, making it an ideal
  subject for studying the relationship between viscosity and temperature.
topics:
- Gas viscosity
- Temperature effects
- Argon
- Physics
- Fluid dynamics
