revised_title: Electromagnetic and Electrostatic Force Comparison and the Electromagnetic
  Theory of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Maxwell compares electrostatic and electromagnetic forces using a torsion balance
  and finds that the ratio of electromagnetic to electrostatic units of electricity
  is 277,900,000 meters per second. He also discusses the relationship between this
  ratio and the velocity of light, suggesting that they are one and the same physical
  quantity.
