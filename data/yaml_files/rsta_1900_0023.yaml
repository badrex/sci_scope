revised_title: Investigation of Electrical Conductivity in Gases Traversed by Cathode
  Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the electrical conductivity of gases when traversed
  by cathode rays and measures the number of ions produced. The experiments provide
  evidence for the production of positive and negative ions in the gas, supporting
  the theory that ionization is responsible for the conductivity.
