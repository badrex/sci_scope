  Part II'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the chemical reactions and interactions of nitrogen
  when exposed to an electric discharge, focusing on its behavior with oxygen, hydrogen,
  nitric oxide, and phosphorus. The study reveals that active nitrogen plays a role
  in the formation of nitrogen peroxide and has implications for estimating the percentage
  of active nitrogen in the total nitrogen after an electric discharge.
