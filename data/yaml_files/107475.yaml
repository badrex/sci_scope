revised_title: Experimental Researches on Caloric and Vapour Elasticity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the elasticity, temperature,
  and latent heat of different vapours, and proposes a new method for measuring thermometric
  admeasurement and capacity. The experiments reveal a formula to determine the elastic
  force of vapours at any temperature and provide a more precise understanding of
  the properties of caloric.
