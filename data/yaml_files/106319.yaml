tldr: The author, J. Haygarth, examines the low mortality rates and health conditions
  in Chester, attributing the city's health to its unique geographical features, such
  as its red sandstone rock foundation, dry cellars, and the Rows, covered galleries
  that provide dry and clean communication between streets. Haygarth also discusses
  the role of the River Dee in washing away liquid filth and the benefits of the city's
  manners and customs on public health.
