tldr: In this letter, Mr. Boyle describes his observations of an earthquake near Oxford
  and the accompanying changes in the atmosphere. He discusses the cold, piercing
  wind and sudden rain, followed by a tremor in the house he was in. He also mentions
  a storm and inquires about the earthquake's effects in the nearby town of Brill,
  where the shaking was reportedly more significant. Boyle expresses his intention
  to provide a more accurate account of the event in the future.
