  Monkeys, Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of faradic excitation of the cerebrum on
  respiration in various animals, identifying four constant effects on respiration
  that can be traced from the cortex to the medulla oblongata. They also discuss the
  importance of general conditions and drug use in producing the anaesthetic state.
