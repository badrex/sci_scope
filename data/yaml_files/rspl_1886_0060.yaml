  and Obsidian'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: This paper investigates the changes in pitchstone and obsidian when exposed
  to heat. The author examines the microscopic structure of the rocks before and after
  heating, observing alterations in color, texture, and crystalline structure. The
  study provides insights into the effects of heat on vitreous rocks and their potential
  petrological significance.
