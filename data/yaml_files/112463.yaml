revised_title: The Molecular Constitution of Gases and the Physical Structure of the
  Sun and Stars
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Astronomy
tldr: The author investigates the molecular composition of gases and applies this
  knowledge to the interpretation of the sun's photosphere, total eclipses, and information
  about stars provided by the spectroscope. The study reveals the temperature and
  density variations in the sun's outer atmosphere and the photosphere, as well as
  the movement of gases and clouds within the solar system.
