revised_title: 'The Action of Radium and Certain Other Salts on Gelatin: A Study of
  Growth and Precipitation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Radiochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of radium and certain other salts on gelatin,
  discovering that only barium, strontium, and lead salts produce a growth. They find
  that this growth is due to the precipitation of barium sulfate and that the presence
  of a soluble sulfate is necessary for its formation.
