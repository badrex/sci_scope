revised_title: Further Investigations on Explosive Agents and Detonation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Explosives
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of explosive agents, particularly gun-cotton,
  nitroglycerine, and iodide of nitrogen, and their susceptibility to detonation.
  The author suggests that the vibrations developed by an explosion play a crucial
  role in the detonation process, and that the compatibility of these vibrations with
  the substance being detonated determines its explosive properties.
