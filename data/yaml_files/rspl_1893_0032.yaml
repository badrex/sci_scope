revised_title: The Influence of Antagonistic Muscle Action on Tonus and Rigor Mortis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the correlation between the action of antagonistic muscles
  and the tonus of the extensor muscles. The experiments show that afferent impulses
  from the flexor muscles increase the tonus of the extensor muscles, suggesting that
  the interference with the knee jerk is located in the spinal mechanism of the reflex.
