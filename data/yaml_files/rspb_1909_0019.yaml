revised_title: Ancestral Gametic Correlations in a Mendelian Population
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Heredity
tldr: The author investigates the ancestral gametic correlations in a Mendelian population
  and finds that the correlations between ancestors and offspring are linear. The
  study also shows that the correlations are close to those determined for somatic
  characters in biometric investigations, suggesting a more intimate relationship
  between gametic and somatic constitutions than just absolute dominance.
