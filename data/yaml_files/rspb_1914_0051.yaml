scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Parasitology
tldr: The authors examine the feeding habits of Glossina morsitans, finding that 99%
  of their diet consists of mammalian blood, primarily from antelope species, while
  only 1% is avian blood. They also find no difference in feeding habits between male
  and female flies and estimate that they feed once every five to six days.
