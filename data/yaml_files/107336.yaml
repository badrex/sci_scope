scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a new theorem for rectifying the hyperbola using two ellipses
  and provides further observations on the rectification process. The paper highlights
  the advantages of descending series over ascending series and offers methods for
  computing the constant quantity by which these series differ from each other.
