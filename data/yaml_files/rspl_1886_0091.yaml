revised_title: Improving the Method of Condensation in Calorimetry for Determining
  Specific Heats
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: The author presents a new method of condensation in calorimetry that allows
  for the determination of specific heats of substances using steam's latent heat.
  The method is simple, accurate, and can be applied to various substances, including
  metallic elements, water, and minerals.
topics:
- Calorimetry
- Specific Heat
- Heat Transfer
- Thermal Properties
