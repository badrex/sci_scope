revised_title: Magnetic Properties of Oxy-hemoglobin, Carbonic-oxide-hemoglobin, and
  Methemoglobin
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Biophysics
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of oxy-hemoglobin, carbonic-oxide-hemoglobin,
  and methemoglobin, finding that oxy-hemoglobin is a strongly diamagnetic body. The
  study also includes a preliminary note on the electrolysis of hemoglobin compounds.
