  Brittleness'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author, Stanesby Alchorne, conducts a series of experiments to determine
  the effects of mixing gold with tin. Contrary to popular belief, he finds that tin
  does not significantly impact the ductility or brittleness of gold when mixed in
  small quantities. This challenges the widely held opinion among metallurgists and
  chemical writers.
