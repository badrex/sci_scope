  and Influence'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the nervous and muscular systems
  in animals, arguing that the brain and spinal marrow are the active parts of the
  nervous system, while nerves and ganglions serve as conduits for their influence.
  The author also concludes that the nervous system's influence on muscles is not
  unique and can be found in other agents, such as galvanism.
