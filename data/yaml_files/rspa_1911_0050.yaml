revised_title: The Measurement of Mechanical Viscosity in Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Rheology
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanical viscosity of fluids in eddying motion,
  finding that the shearing stress is proportional to the mean speed of flow and is
  also a function of the dimensions of the channel in which the motion takes place.
  They provide a method for measuring the mechanical viscosity and discuss their findings
  in relation to both artificially roughened and smooth pipes.
