tldr: Dr. Gothofredus Guil. Leibnitz presents a new method for creating precise portable
  watches that relies on a mechanical reflection rather than the equal duration of
  unequal vibrations of pendulums or springs. The design involves two springs working
  alternately, ensuring a uniform play that continues without interruption.
