revised_title: Production of Olefines from Paraffin through Distillation under Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the production of olefines from paraffin through distillation
  under pressure, obtaining a mixture of hydrocarbons with the majority boiling between
  200 and 300 degrees Celsius. They also identify the presence of amylene and a possible
  mixture of hexylene in the obtained liquid hydrocarbons.
