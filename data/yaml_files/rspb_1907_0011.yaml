  of Nucleo-proteids of Testes in Solution'

tldr: The author investigates the relationship between albinism and pigmentation in
  intravascular coagulation. They find that two sub-races of albinoes exist, one clotting
  upon intravascular injection of nucleo-proteids and the other not. The study also
  examines the behavior of nucleo-proteids from testes in solution and their effect
  on coagulation.
