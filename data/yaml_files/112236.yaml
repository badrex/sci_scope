tldr: The author explores the dual function of alkaline peroxides as agents of oxidation
  and reduction. They demonstrate that catalytic decomposition can be seen as a combination
  of these two actions, with oxidation and reduction occurring simultaneously. The
  study also shows that in many cases, catalytic change is brought about by intermediate
  compounds that are formed and destroyed during the process.
