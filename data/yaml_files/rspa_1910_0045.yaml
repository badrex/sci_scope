revised_title: Sound Extinction in a Viscous Atmosphere by Small Cylindrical and Spherical
  Obstacles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The study investigates the extinction of sound in a viscous atmosphere by small
  cylindrical and spherical obstacles. It finds that the ratio of lost energy to incident
  energy is at most 10^-2 for obstacles with a radius of not less than 10^-3 cm. The
  results are extended to multiple obstacles, and the formula's applicability to fogs
  is discussed, considering the water particles' inertia and viscosity of the air.
