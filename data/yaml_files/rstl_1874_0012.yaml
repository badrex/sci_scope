revised_title: 'Studies on the Origin of Bacteria and Torulce: Sterilization by Heat
  and the Panspermic Theory'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbiology Techniques
tldr: The authors investigate the conditions under which organic liquids and mixtures
  become sterile through heat, and examine the possibility of organisms arising de
  novo in animal and plant juices. They also test the validity of the panspermic theory
  and abiogenesis through various experiments, concluding that while Bacteria and
  Torulce can arise from preexisting germs, there may be conditions in which they
  can also arise de novo.
