revised_title: The Influence of Draught of Water on Ship Stability
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: This paper investigates the relationship between a ship's stability and its
  draught of water, demonstrating that light draught can be as dangerous as low freeboard.
  The author presents cross curves of stability, which show how stability varies with
  draught of water at constant angles of inclination, and emphasizes the importance
  of considering both righting moments and angles of inclination in ship stability
  analysis.
