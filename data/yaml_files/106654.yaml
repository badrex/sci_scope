revised_title: Irritability and Spontaneous Motion in Vegetables
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the irritability of plant stamina, specifically in Barberry
  and Cactus Tuna flowers, and observes similar phenomena in other plants like Dionaea
  muscipula, Mimosa, and Drosera. The purpose of this irritability is to facilitate
  pollination by insects, as well as the spontaneous motion of some plants, such as
  Rue, which aids in the dispersal of pollen.
