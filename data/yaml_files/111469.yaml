revised_title: The Origin of Magnesian Rocks and Mineral Springs
scientific_discipline: Earth & Environmental Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the origin of magnesian rocks and mineral springs, examining
  their chemical composition and geological context. They find that the solubility
  of carbonate of magnesia in these waters is influenced by the presence of carbonate
  of soda, and that alkaline springs may be formed through the slow decomposition
  of felspathic debris in the presence of earthy carbonates.
