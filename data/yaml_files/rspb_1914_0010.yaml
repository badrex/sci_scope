revised_title: The Influence of Tissue Resonance on Blood Pressure and Pulse Transmission
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Vascular Medicine
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of tissue resonance on blood pressure and
  pulse transmission, demonstrating that the resonance of surrounding tissues can
  affect the accuracy of blood pressure readings. They propose that the resonance
  of tissues can either enhance or dampen the pulse, depending on the synchronization
  of periodic vibrations with the arterial pulse.
