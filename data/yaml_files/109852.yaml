revised_title: The Effect of Mechanical Compression and Dilatation on the Structure
  of Doubly-Refracting Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical compression and dilatation
  on various substances, including glass, muriate of soda, and fluor spar, and discovers
  that these processes can induce polarizing and depolarizing properties in materials.
  He also proposes the development of a chromatic dynamometer for measuring force
  intensity and suggests that variations in temperature and humidity could be measured
  using chromatic thermometers and hygrometers.
