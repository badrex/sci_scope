revised_title: The Solvent Action of Bile and Its Role in Fat Absorption
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the role of bile in digestion and excretion, discovering
  that bile acts as a solvent for substances insoluble in water, such as cholestearin
  and lecithin. They also find that bile significantly increases the solubility of
  sodium soaps, which play a crucial role in fat absorption.
