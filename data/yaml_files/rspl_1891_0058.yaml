revised_title: On the Relative Densities of Hydrogen and Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Physical Chemistry
tldr: In this study, Lord Rayleigh investigates the relative densities of hydrogen
  and oxygen using improved experimental techniques and gas purification methods.
  He finds that the ratio of densities is approximately 15884, with a focus on minimizing
  systematic errors and impurities in the gases.
