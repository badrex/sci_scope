revised_title: Application of Kinetic Theory to Electric, Magnetic, and Optical Properties
  of Diatomic Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: This paper applies the Boltzmann-Maxwell Kinetic Theory of Gases to the electric,
  magnetic, and optical properties of diatomic gases, such as hydrogen and oxygen.
  The author calculates the magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constant, and electrical
  conductivity, and discusses the optical control, dispersion, and polarization effects.
  The results are compared to experimental observations and other theories.
topics:
- Kinetic Theory of Gases
- Electric Properties
- Magnetic Properties
- Optical Properties
- Diatomic Gases
