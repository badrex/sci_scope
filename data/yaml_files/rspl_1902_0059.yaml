revised_title: 'Influence of Temperature on the Conductivity of Electrolytic Solutions:
  A Review of the Evidence and Experimental Findings'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: This article investigates the influence of temperature on the conductivity of
  electrolytic solutions, examining the relationship between temperature and conductivity,
  and the factors affecting the coefficient of ionisation. The authors present evidence
  for the existence of upper and lower limits of conductivity and discuss the implications
  of these findings on the understanding of electrolysis and the properties of electrolytes.
