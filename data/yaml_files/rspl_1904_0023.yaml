scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Solar Physics
tldr: This study examines the changes in heliographic latitudes of sunspots from 1861
  to 1902, revealing anomalies in the distribution and movement of sunspots. The findings
  indicate that the law of Sporer, although significant, only represents a general
  idea of the complex sunspot circulation.
