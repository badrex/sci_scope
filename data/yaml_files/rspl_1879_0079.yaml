revised_title: A New Method for Analyzing Spectra and the Genesis of Spectral Lines
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author presents a new method of spectrum observation using a spark and a
  Bunsen flame to analyze the behavior of spectral lines. The method reveals striking
  differences in the spectra of various elements, providing insights into the genesis
  of spectral lines and the dissociation of molecular groupings.
