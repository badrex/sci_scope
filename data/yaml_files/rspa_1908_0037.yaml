revised_title: Investigating the Electrical Resistance of Moving Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Relativity
tldr: The authors attempt to measure the direction and magnitude of ether drift by
  investigating the electrical resistance of a wire moving through the ether. They
  use the Wheatstone bridge method and observe no significant effect, suggesting that
  the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction may be masked by other compensating changes or
  that the specific resistance of the material changes direction.
