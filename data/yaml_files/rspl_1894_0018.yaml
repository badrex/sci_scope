revised_title: A Precision Instrument for Grinding and Polishing Crystal Section-Plates
  and Prisms
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Materials Science
tldr: The authors present an instrument that accurately grinds and polishes section-plates
  and prisms of crystals, allowing for precise determination of optical constants.
  The instrument enables the grinding of a truly plane surface in any desired direction
  within ten minutes of arc, significantly reducing the time and risk of fracturing
  crystals compared to traditional hand-grinding methods.
