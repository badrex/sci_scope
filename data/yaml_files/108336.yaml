revised_title: Experiments on Voltaic Ignition and the Decomposition of Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effects of different gases on the ignition of a
  platinum wire using voltaic ignition and decomposes water into its constituent gases.
  The experiments reveal that hydrogen has a unique effect on the intensity of ignition
  and that various gases undergo different reactions when exposed to the ignited wire.
topics:
- Voltaic Ignition
- Eudiometry
- Decomposition of Water
