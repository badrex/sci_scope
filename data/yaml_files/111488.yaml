revised_title: Discovery of the "Corps Innomine" in the Spermatic Cord
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author, F. Girald√©s, discovers tubular and vesicular structures in the spermatic
  cord, which he calls "Corps Innomine." These structures are remnants of the Wolffian
  body from the embryo and can be found in both males and females. The author also
  suggests that some cysts in the spermatic cord may originate from the dilatation
  of the tubular elements of the "Corps Innomine."
