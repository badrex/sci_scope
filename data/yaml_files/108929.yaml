revised_title: Fermat's Mysteries of Numbers and Their Connection to Triangular and
  Square Numbers
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author explores the properties of odd numbers and their connection to Fermat's
  theorems, demonstrating that all odd numbers can be composed of four squares and
  that they possess specific algebraic properties. The author also discusses the relationship
  between these properties and the gradation series, which reveals a connection between
  the sum of the roots and the number of squares in an odd number.
