revised_title: On the Analysis of Acoustic Figures and Vibrating Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibrations
tldr: The author investigates the patterns formed by sand on vibrating surfaces, known
  as acoustic figures, and analyzes the underlying modes of vibration. He demonstrates
  that these figures can be explained by the superposition of simple modes of vibration
  and that the resultant figure varies with the component modes, the number of superpositions,
  and the angles at which they are superposed.
