revised_title: The Identification of Muriatic Acid in Animal Stomachs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: William Prout investigates the acid and saline matters present in animal stomachs,
  specifically the muriatic acid and its role in digestion. He conducts experiments
  on a rabbit's stomach and concludes that a significant amount of unsaturated muriatic
  acid exists during digestion. Prout also infers that muriatic acid performs the
  same function in the human stomach.
