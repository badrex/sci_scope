revised_title: Investigating the Magnetism of Iron Arising from Its Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author discovers that the rotation of iron in different directions affects
  the polarity of the iron and its influence on a magnetic needle. This phenomenon
  may indicate the cause of the Earth's magnetism and could lead to further investigation
  of the underlying principles of magnetism.
