revised_title: Motional Effects of Maxwell's Ether-Stress
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors explore the motion effects of Maxwell's ether-stress, analyzing
  the distribution of netic energy and momentum in the aether. They discuss the connection
  between the transference of energy across an area and the stress across that area,
  and propose a velocity for the medium in which stress resides.

- Electromagnetic Theory
- Ethe
- Maxwell's Equations
- Motional Effects
