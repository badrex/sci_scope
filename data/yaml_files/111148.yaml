tldr: James Prescott Joule presents an air-engine design that compresses air into
  a heated receiver and releases it through a cylinder. The difference between the
  work done by the cylinder and the work absorbed by the pump determines the engine's
  overall output. Joule suggests using lower temperatures for better fuel efficiency,
  reducing consumption by two-thirds compared to steam engines.
