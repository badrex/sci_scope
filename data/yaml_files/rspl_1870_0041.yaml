revised_title: Measurements of Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics and Paraffine
  Expansion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Dielectric Materials
tldr: This paper describes experiments on the specific inductive capacity of paraffine
  and its dependence on temperature using the platymeter and sliding condenser instruments.
  The authors find that the specific inductive capacity of paraffine remains constant
  with temperature variations, and provide details of an improved sliding condenser
  design.
