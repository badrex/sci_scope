revised_title: A Method for Computing Integrals in Physical Astronomy
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author presents a method for computing integrals of certain differential
  expressions related to problems in physical astronomy. The method can be applied
  to expand formulas for estimating planetary perturbations and is particularly useful
  when the radii of the orbits are nearly equal.
topics:
- Differential Equations
- Astronomical Calculus
- Geometric Series
- Series Convergence
- Planetary Perturbations
