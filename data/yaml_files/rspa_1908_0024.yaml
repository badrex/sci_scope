revised_title: 'Titanic Oxide: A Study of Polymorphs and Isomorphs'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the crystal structure of titanic oxide, examining its
  polymorphs (anatase, brookite, and rutile) and isomorphs. By determining the relative
  sizes of constituent atoms, the author calculates molecular volumes and provides
  insights into the crystal structure and properties of each form of titanic oxide.
