revised_title: On the Circulation of the Blood and Sphygmograph-Trace Analysis
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Cardiovascular Physiology
tldr: The author presents a series of measurements and analyses of sphygmograph-trace
  data to study the circulation of the blood and the relationship between the cardiosystole,
  sphygmosystole, and pulse-beat. The study confirms the previously published laws
  regarding the length of cardiosystole and sphygmosystole and introduces the concept
  of'syspasis,' the time taken by the ventricle to elevate its internal pressure before
  the aortic valve opens up.
