  Coordination'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the anatomy and physiology of Antedon rosaceus, focusing
  on the nervous system and the coordination of swimming movements. Experiments conducted
  on living specimens provide evidence supporting the role of the quinquelocular organ
  as the center of a nervous system, with the axial cords of the arms and pinnules
  as its peripheral portion.
