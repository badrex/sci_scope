scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: Dr. W. Roberts corrects an error in his previous paper on the estimation of
  amylolytic and proteolytic activity of pancreatic extracts. He acknowledges the
  work of Mr. W. R. Dunstan and Mr. A. E. Dimmock, who described a similar process
  for estimating diastase activity on starch gelatine.
