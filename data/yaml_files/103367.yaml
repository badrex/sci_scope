tldr: Dr. Edmond Halley observes an unusual Aurora Borealis in London on November
  10, 1719. He describes the white streaks, the canopy of white striae, and the rapid
  movement of the lights. Halley also notes the calm and serene sky, which seems to
  be a common factor in Aurora Borealis phenomena.
