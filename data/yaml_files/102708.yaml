revised_title: Demonstrating the Pressure of Air on Hemispheres
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducts an experiment to demonstrate the pressure of air on hemispheres.
  He uses two brass hemispheres connected by a wet leather seal and a glass receiver.
  By injecting an atmosphere of air into the system and measuring the weight required
  to separate the hemispheres, Hauksbee shows that the pressure of the air plays a
  significant role in the separation process.
