scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author, John Christian Bowring, critiques the existing amalgamation process
  for silver ores in Mexico and proposes a new method involving copper deutoxide and
  bichloride, which forms an oxy-chloride and a brick-red insoluble salt that reduces
  silver sulfide to metallic silver.
