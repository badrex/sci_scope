revised_title: The Physiological Effects of Choline and Neurine on the Cardiovascular
  System
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Pharmacology
tldr: This study investigates the physiological effects of choline and neurine on
  the cardiovascular system. Choline causes a fall in blood pressure due to its action
  on the heart and peripheral vessels, while neurine produces a fall followed by a
  rise in blood pressure, likely due to its effects on peripheral ganglia and constriction
  of blood vessels. These findings have implications for understanding the toxic effects
  of these substances in diseases like General Paralysis of the Insane.
