revised_title: Electromotive Changes in the Mammalian Heart
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Electrophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the electromotive changes associated with the beating
  of the mammalian heart, focusing on the human heart. They describe experiments that
  reveal the normal ventricular variation is diphasic, indicating negativity of the
  apex and base. They also explore the distribution of cardiac potential in humans
  and animals, demonstrating electrical effects by leading off from the surface of
  the intact body through various extremities and natural orifices.
