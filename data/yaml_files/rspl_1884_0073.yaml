revised_title: The Role of Lymph Corpuscles in the Absorption of Nutrients and the
  Origin of Proteids in Chyle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author investigates the role of lymph corpuscles in the absorption of nutrients,
  particularly fats, in the small intestine. They demonstrate that these cells play
  a crucial role in the transference of food materials from the intestinal epithelium
  to the lacteals, and that they disintegrate and dissolve in the chyle, releasing
  proteins and other nutrients.
