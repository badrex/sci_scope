revised_title: Photographic Analysis of the Nebula in Orion's Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: J. Norman Lockyer and F. R. S. examine the spectrum of the Orion Nebula using
  photographs and a 30-inch reflector. They find a remarkable similarity between the
  photographs and determine the wave-lengths of various lines in the spectrum, including
  the least refrangible line at approximately 3729. This research contributes to the
  understanding of celestial objects and their spectra.
