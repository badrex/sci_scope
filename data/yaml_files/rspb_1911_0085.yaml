revised_title: 'Heredity in Sea Urchins: Crossbreeding Echinus esculentus and Echinocardium
  cordatum'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the inheritance of paternal and maternal characters
  in hybrid sea urchins by crossing Echinus esculentus and Echinocardium cordatum.
  The hybrid larvae exhibit purely maternal characters, regardless of the cross direction,
  suggesting that the principle of Mendelian dominance governs the expression of traits
  in the offspring.
