revised_title: 'On the Repulsion Resulting from Radiation: Part IV'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the repulsion produced by different rays
  of the solar spectrum using a radiometer. The results show that the mechanical action
  of radiation is a function of both luminous rays and dark heat-rays, and that the
  effect is not solely due to heat or light but rather a combination of wave-lengths.
