revised_title: A New Method for Determining Viscosity at High Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author presents a new method for determining the viscosity of liquids, specifically
  metals and salts, at high temperatures. The method is based on the oscillation of
  a horizontal disc in the liquid and can be used for temperatures up to 1200Â°C. The
  main challenge in this method is preventing surface oxidation of metals, which can
  spoil the observations.
