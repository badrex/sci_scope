revised_title: 'The Theory of Decay in Radioactive Luminous Compounds: A Revised Approach'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the decay of luminosity in radioactive luminous compounds,
  proposing a new theory of recovery to explain the observed behavior. This theory
  suggests that destroyed active centers recover at a rate proportional to their concentration,
  providing a more accurate representation of the complete luminosity curve.
