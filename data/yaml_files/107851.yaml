revised_title: Investigating the Deviation of Magnetized Needles towards Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the deviation of magnetized needles towards iron and
  proposes a simple law to explain the phenomenon. The law states that the position
  of a magnetized needle in the presence of iron can be determined by referring the
  freely suspended needle to a plane perpendicular to the first. The author also discusses
  the importance of determining the positions of the points of greatest intensity
  and the magnetic center of the needle in understanding the phenomenon.
