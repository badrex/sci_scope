revised_title: On the Equilibrium of an Incompressible Fluid Under Accelerating Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the conditions of equilibrium for an incompressible
  fluid subjected to accelerating forces, focusing on the figure of a fluid mass and
  the role of centrifugal force in maintaining equilibrium. The study explores the
  properties of spheroids and the distribution of pressures within a fluid mass.
