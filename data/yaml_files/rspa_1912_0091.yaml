revised_title: Crystallo-Optical Investigation of Nitrogen, Argon, Methane, and Organic
  Compounds with Low Melting Points
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Crystallography
tldr: The author develops a method for studying the crystallographic properties of
  gaseous elements and organic compounds at low temperatures using quartz-glass crystallization
  vessels. The study focuses on nitrogen, argon, methane, and simpler organic compounds
  with low melting points, providing insights into their crystal structures and optical
  properties.
