revised_title: Investigation of Minimum Spark Potential in Various Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the minimum potential difference required to produce
  sparks in various gases, such as air, hydrogen, nitrogen, and helium, at different
  pressures and distances between parallel plates. The results support the idea that
  the negative glow in gases requires a specific potential difference for its production,
  which is independent of pressure.
