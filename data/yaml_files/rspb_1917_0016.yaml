revised_title: 'Vibrations and Sponge-Spicules: A Study on Lateral Vibrations of Bars
  of Variable Section'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author investigates the lateral vibrations of bars with variable sections
  and their potential influence on the development of sponge-spicules. While the vibratory
  theory seems to explain the position of whorls in some spicules, surface tension
  is considered a more likely factor in most cases.
