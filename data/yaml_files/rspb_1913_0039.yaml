scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Pathogen Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the morphology of various strains of the trypanosome
  causing disease in humans in Nyasaland, focusing on the wild Glossina morsitans
  strain. They analyze the length, distribution, and posterior-nuclear forms of the
  trypanosomes in five different strains, providing insights into the disease transmission
  and potential treatment strategies.
