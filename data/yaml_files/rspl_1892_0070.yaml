revised_title: Magnetic Properties of High-Temperature Iron
scientific_discipline: Materials Science
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This study investigates the magnetic properties of pure iron at various temperatures,
  revealing a marked decrease in hysteresis and a lower maximum induction with increasing
  temperature. The research also shows that the permeability rises remarkably with
  temperature for small magnetizing forces, but the opposite occurs for larger forces.
