scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Climate Science
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the Gulf Stream's extension
  and the temperature variations experienced by the British Islands. By analyzing
  temperature data from various coastal stations, the author concludes that during
  warmer winters, the difference in temperature between coastal and inland stations
  is greater, supporting the hypothesis that the Gulf Stream's thermal influence plays
  a significant role in determining the climate of the region.
