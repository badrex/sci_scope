revised_title: Further Observations on Nova Persei's Spectrum and Characteristics
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Evolution
tldr: The author presents further observations on the spectrum of Nova Persei, noting
  significant changes in the intensity and position of hydrogen and helium lines.
  The enhanced lines of other elements have disappeared, and the author suggests that
  multiple gases may be involved in the spectrum's formation. The Nova's disc is also
  found to be larger than neighboring stars, likely due to its strong ultra-violet
  rays.
