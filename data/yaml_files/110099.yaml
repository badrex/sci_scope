revised_title: Discovery of New Compounds of Carbon and Hydrogen in Oil Decomposition
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Hydrocarbons
tldr: The author, M. Faraday, investigates the decomposition of oil by heat and discovers
  new compounds of carbon and hydrogen. These compounds include bicarburet of hydrogen
  and a lightweight, highly combustible gas. The paper also discusses the potential
  uses of these substances, such as fuel for lamps and solvents for caoutchouc and
  essential oils.
