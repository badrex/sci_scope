tldr: Smithson Tennant discovers a new metal, osmium, in the black powder remaining
  after the solution of platina. He describes its properties, including its strong
  smell, and its ability to form a deep vivid blue color when mixed with an infusion
  of galls. Osmium is found to be unique in that it cannot be separated from gold
  and platina using the usual refining processes.
