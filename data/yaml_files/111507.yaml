scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Materials Chemistry
tldr: The author, George Gore, examines the properties of electro-deposited antimony
  and its changes upon heating. He concludes that the substance is a weak chemical
  compound of antimony and acid hydrochlorate of terchloride, decomposable by heat,
  and that the observed changes are due to molecular alterations and partial chemical
  decompositions based on the temperature and discharge rate.
