scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author reexamines the classification of the fossil reptile Theriodesmus
  phylarchus and discusses the similarities and differences between its structure
  and that of mammals. The author concludes that while there are some resemblances,
  the humerus and other bones of Theriodesmus are more closely related to reptiles,
  specifically Theriodonts, than to mammals.
