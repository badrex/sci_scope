revised_title: Investigating the Spectrum of β Aquilae
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The authors analyze the spectrum of β Aquilae, a star with peculiar spectral
  lines, and find similarities with other stars like α Arietis. They conclude that
  the spectrum of β Aquilae is a transition stage between the first and second type,
  and suggest that it may be a composite spectrum with elements of both types.
