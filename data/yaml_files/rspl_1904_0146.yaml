revised_title: Phosphorescence and Phase Changes in Barium Platino-Cyanide Induced
  by Radium's Beta and Gamma Rays
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of radium's beta and gamma rays on barium
  platino-cyanide, observing a reduction in phosphorescence and a change in color.
  The study suggests that the transformation is akin to the change from crystalline
  to amorphous states in metals, with the crystalline structure being necessary for
  the highest phosphorescence.
