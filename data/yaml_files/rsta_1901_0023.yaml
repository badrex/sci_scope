tldr: This article discusses the analysis of frequency distributions and the development
  of new mathematical criteria for identifying and categorizing various types of curves
  in the context of the theory of evolution. It introduces new types of frequency
  curves, such as Type V and Type VI, and provides methods for calculating their moments
  and fitting them to actual statistics.
