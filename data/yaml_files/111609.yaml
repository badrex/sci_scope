scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the algebraic properties of scalars, formators, and
  clinants, introducing the concepts of formator algebra, the algebra of differences,
  and the algebra of derivatives. The study of these algebras leads to the development
  of new methods for solving equations, approximating roots, and understanding coordinate
  geometry.
