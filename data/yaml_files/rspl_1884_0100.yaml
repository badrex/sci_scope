revised_title: The Essential Nature of Phytophagous Larvae's Colouring and its Relation
  to their Food-Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Physiology
tldr: 'The author investigates the colouring of phytophagous larvae and their pupae,
  discovering that their colouration is determined by two factors: pigments derived
  from their food-plants, such as chlorophyll and xanthophyll, and pigments specific
  to the larvae. The study also explores the relationship between the colour of the
  larvae and their food-plants, and the protective role of colour variations in certain
  species.'
