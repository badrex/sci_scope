tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the atmospheric electric potential
  gradient and the earth-air current using a gold leaf electrometer. The study aims
  to determine if the dissipation factor found for the exposed test-plate can be used
  to calculate the current from the atmosphere into the ground when the potential
  gradient is known. The measurements were conducted in a valley near Peebles, Scotland,
  and the results provide insights into the relationship between the charge on the
  test-plate and the charge per square centimeter of the ground.
