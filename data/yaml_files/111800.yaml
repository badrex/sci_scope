revised_title: The Influence of Temperature Variations on the Descent of Glaciers
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Climate Change
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature variations on the descent
  of a lead sheet on an inclined plane and applies this concept to the movement of
  glaciers. The study suggests that daily temperature fluctuations can cause significant
  movement in glaciers, with implications for meteorological research.
