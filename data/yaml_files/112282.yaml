revised_title: The Influence of Temperature on Urea Secretion in Tropical Environments
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: Dr. Emil Becher investigates the effect of temperature on urea secretion during
  a voyage to China and a stay in Hong Kong. The study reveals a significant relationship
  between air temperature and daily urea excretion, with a decrease in excretion at
  temperatures above 76Â°F, marking the physiological limit of the tropical zone.
