  Fourth Memoir'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This article by John Tyndall investigates the absorption and radiation of heat
  by gaseous and liquid matter, focusing on the effects of different thicknesses and
  the influence of attenuation. The experiments demonstrate the opacity of gases to
  radiations from the same gas and the varying energy levels of gases and vapors in
  thin and thick strata.
