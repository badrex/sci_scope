revised_title: The Tension of Metallic Films Deposited by Electrolysis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the tension of metallic films deposited by electrolysis,
  focusing on nickel. They find that the tension increases with the thickness of the
  deposit and that a good deposit has a tension of between 18 and 19 tons per square
  inch.
