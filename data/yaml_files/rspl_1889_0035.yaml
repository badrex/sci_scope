revised_title: Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics under Rapidly Alternating
  Electric Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: J. J. Thomson investigates the specific inductive capacity of dielectrics when
  exposed to rapidly alternating electric forces. He measures the wave-length of electrical
  vibrations produced by a capacitor's plates and finds that the specific inductive
  capacity is very close to the square of the refractive index for vibrations with
  frequencies around 25,000,000 per second.
