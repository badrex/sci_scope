revised_title: Effects of Increased Intra-Cranial Pressure on Circulation and Respiration
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Neurosurgery
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of increased intra-cranial pressure on circulation
  and respiration, finding that a diminished activity of the medulla occurs as a sequence
  of events with an increase in pressure. They also demonstrate how the three 'centers'
  regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration can be impeded or arrested,
  allowing for an estimation of their varying influences.
