revised_title: 'Liquation of Metals of the Platinum Group: Effects of Cooling Alloys'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of cooling on various alloys of the platinum
  group, particularly gold-platinum, gold-palladium, platinum-palladium, platinum-rhodium,
  and gold-aluminium. The study reveals that the cooling process causes certain alloys
  to separate, with the more fusible constituents forming the outer layer and the
  less fusible ones moving to the center. This knowledge can be valuable for understanding
  the behavior of these alloys in industrial applications.
