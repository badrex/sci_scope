revised_title: The Use of Fossil Shells in Soil Fertilization
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Fertilization
tldr: Roger Pickering shares his findings on the use of fossil shells, specifically
  those of Buccinum vulgar or Whilk, as a natural fertilizer for agricultural land.
  He describes a case where a farmer's land, fertilized with fossil shells, yielded
  a remarkable crop, leading to increased land value and potential profit. Pickering
  suggests that more experiments should be conducted to further explore the benefits
  of using fossil shells in agriculture.
