revised_title: The Fragility and Unusual Properties of Unannealed Glass Vessels
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author discusses the experiments conducted on unannealed glass vessels,
  which are extremely fragile and break easily when exposed to certain substances.
  These glasses can resist heavy blows and shocks from some objects, but shatter when
  exposed to others, such as small particles of flint or certain minerals. The phenomenon
  is explained as a result of the glass's lack of annealing, which leads to its brittleness.
