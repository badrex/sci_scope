revised_title: Observations on Stratified Discharges and the Behavior of Striae
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of striae in stratified discharges using
  a revolving mirror and various experimental setups. He discovers that striae have
  a proper motion along the tube and can be classified into flake-like and flocculent
  types, with the latter being composed of elementary striae.
