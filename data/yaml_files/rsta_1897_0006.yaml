revised_title: Experiments on the Absence of Mechanical Connexion between Ether and
  Matter
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to investigate the connection between
  ether and matter, focusing on the absence of mechanical connexion and the influence
  of rotating matter on the velocity of light. The experiments involve rotating steel
  disks and observing the effect on light interference patterns, leading to the conclusion
  that no first-order effect of purely irrotational ethereal motion can be optically
  detected.
topics:
- Ether
- Viscosity
- Aberration
- Rotational Motion
- Interference Fringes
