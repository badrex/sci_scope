revised_title: Microscopic Analysis of Devitrified Glass and Analogous Structures
  in Rocks
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Petrology
tldr: The authors investigate the microscopic structures of devitrified glass and
  their similarities to structures found in rocks. They examine various forms of glass
  and describe the process of devitrification, including the conditions under which
  it occurs. The study contributes to the understanding of the natural and artificial
  devitrification of glassy rocks.
