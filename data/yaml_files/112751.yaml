revised_title: The Mechanics of Parturition and the Role of Muscular Forces in Childbirth
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Obstetrics
tldr: This article investigates the muscular forces involved in the process of childbirth,
  specifically examining the role of the uterus and abdominal muscles. The author
  calculates the maximum hydrostatic pressure produced by uterine contractions and
  the expulsive force available from abdominal muscle contractions, providing insight
  into the mechanics of labor and the factors that contribute to a successful birth.
