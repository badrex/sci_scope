revised_title: Investigating the Relative Powers of Metallic Substances as Conductors
  of Electricity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author conducts experiments to measure the relative conducting power of
  various metallic substances and their heat evolution during electrical explosions.
  The results reveal the conducting power of metals when alloyed and the influence
  of small amounts of alloy on conductivity.
