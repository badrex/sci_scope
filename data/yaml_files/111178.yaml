scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: W.R. Grove's experiments demonstrate that the polarity of gases affects the
  oxidation and reduction of metals during electrical discharges. The author explains
  that the gas surrounding the electrodes becomes chemically polarized before each
  discharge, leading to different reactions depending on the gas composition and electrode
  polarity.
