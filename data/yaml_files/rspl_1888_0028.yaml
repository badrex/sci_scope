revised_title: 'Color Photometry: The Measurement of Reflected Colors'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors develop a method to measure the light of the spectrum reflected
  from colored bodies, such as pigments, in terms of the light of the spectrum reflected
  from a white surface. They also investigate the color perception of colorblind individuals
  and the spectrum intensity of gaslight compared to electric light.
