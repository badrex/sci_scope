tldr: Thomas Andrews investigates the heat evolved during the reaction of acids and
  bases, finding that the heat is determined by the basic element of the combination
  rather than the acid element. He also discovers that when one base displaces another
  from its neutral combinations, the heat evolved is the same, regardless of the acid
  element involved.
