scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author, George Thin, examines the structure of hyaline cartilage using nitrate
  of silver staining and Bismarck brown staining methods. He discovers that the matrix
  of hyaline cartilage is formed by a series of lamellae arranged parallel to the
  free surface of the cartilage, and this structure is visible in both staining methods.
