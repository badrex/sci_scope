revised_title: Investigations into the Properties and Substitution Products of Silicic
  Acid and Colloidal Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Colloid & Surface Chemistry
tldr: The author explores the properties of silicic acid and other colloidal substances,
  examining their solubility, liquidity, and tendency to aggregate. He also investigates
  the formation of various substitution products, such as alcosol and alcogel, by
  replacing water in silicic acid hydrates with alcohol.
