revised_title: Experimental Investigation of Thermal Effects of Compressing Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule investigates the thermal effects of compressing fluids, focusing on water
  and sperm oil, and finds that the compression of fluids results in a minute but
  appreciable increase in temperature. This study contributes to the understanding
  of thermodynamics and the mechanical equivalent of heat.
