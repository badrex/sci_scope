tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, investigates various properties of different types
  of air, including fixed air, mephitic air, and inflammable air. He explores the
  effects of fixed air on water, discovering that it imparts properties similar to
  Pyrmont water and can dissolve iron. Priestley also examines the relationship between
  fixed air and electricity, finding that it does not create an electrical atmosphere.
