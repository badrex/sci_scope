revised_title: Histological and Physiological Observations on Pepsin-Forming Glands
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The authors investigate the histology and physiology of pepsin-forming glands
  in various animals, observing changes in cell size, granularity, and enzyme secretion
  during digestion. They conclude that the processes of cell growth, zymogen formation,
  and enzyme conversion occur simultaneously and that differences in histological
  changes among animals are due to varying rates of these processes.
