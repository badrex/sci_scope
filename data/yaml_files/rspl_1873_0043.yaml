revised_title: 'On the Pneumatic Action in Articulation of Sounds by the Human Voice:
  A Study Using a Recording Instrument'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Speech & Language Sciences
tldr: The author constructs a recording instrument to study the pneumatic action accompanying
  the articulation of sounds by the human voice. The instrument records the expulsion
  of air from the mouth during speech, revealing variations in pneumatic actions for
  different articulations and providing insights into the process and effects of articulation.
