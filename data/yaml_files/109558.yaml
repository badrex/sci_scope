scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author, John Hellins, investigates the rectification of the hyperbola, focusing
  on the series convergence and divergence. He presents nine theorems for different
  series and discusses methods for computing the values of constant quantities. Hellins
  also provides examples and corrects an error in the length of an arch of an equilateral
  hyperbola.
