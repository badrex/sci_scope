  Selaginella'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the presence of aluminium in certain vascular cryptogams,
  specifically Lycopodium and Selaginella species. They find that while alumina is
  present in notable amounts in Lycopodium, it is practically absent from Selaginella.
  The study also examines the presence of alumina in related plant genera and discusses
  the potential sources of this element in plants.
topics:
- Cryptogams
- Lycopodium
