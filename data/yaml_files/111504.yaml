scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Reaction Mechanisms
tldr: The author investigates the reaction between tertiary amines and phosphines
  with bibromide of ethylene, resulting in the formation of new compounds. The study
  demonstrates the unique behavior of these substances under specific conditions and
  expands our understanding of chemical reactions and molecular arrangements.
