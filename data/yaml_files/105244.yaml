  Gold'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the properties of platina and its mixtures with gold,
  examining its color, ductility, and specific gravity. The experiments reveal that
  certain proportions of platina and gold can be combined without significantly affecting
  the properties of either metal, while other mixtures result in spongy, brittle compounds.
