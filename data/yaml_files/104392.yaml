tldr: A Roman hypocaustum, or sweating room, was discovered under the ground in Lincoln
  in 1739. The structure, which includes a praefurnium, furnace, and alveus, was analyzed
  and its dimensions were taken. The walls of the room were plastered and painted,
  and the floor was covered in a tessellated pavement. This discovery provides valuable
  insight into ancient Roman heating systems and architecture.
