tldr: Dr. John Albert Schlosser and Mr. John Ellis describe a curious fleshy, coral-like
  substance found in the sea, which they believe to be a new species of alcyonium.
  The substance is composed of many thin, hollow radii with a unique structure and
  behavior. They also observe eggs of different sizes within the interstices between
  the stars, suggesting potential reproduction methods.
