  by a Perfectly Conducting Sphere
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Waves
tldr: The authors present numerical results for the diffraction of a plane electromagnetic
  wave by a perfectly conducting sphere, evaluating the functions and gradients involved
  in the process. The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic
  waves in the presence of conductive spheres.
