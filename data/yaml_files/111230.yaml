revised_title: Arctic Sea Currents and Their Influence on Water Density and Climate
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: The author discusses the influence of currents in the Arctic seas on water density
  and climate. He suggests that refrigeration causes disturbances in water density,
  leading to the need for currents and counter-currents. The author also examines
  the differences in climate and wildlife on either side of Davis's Straits and the
  possible causes of these differences.
