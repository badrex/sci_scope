revised_title: A Novel Micro-Manometer Design for Measuring Small Pressures
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Instrumentation & Measurement
tldr: The authors present a new micro-manometer design that can measure small pressures
  and is suitable for use as an anemometer. The device features a U-tube with a fine-bore
  connecting tube containing an index bubble, which allows for precise measurements
  and compensation for changes in position or level. The sensitiveness of the gauge
  depends on the ratio between the bores of the limbs and the connecting tube, as
  well as the fluid used in the gauge.
