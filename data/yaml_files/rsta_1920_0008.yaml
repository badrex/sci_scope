revised_title: 'Molecular Field and Crystalline Media: Influence of Molecular Constitution
  and Temperature on Magnetic Susceptibility'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular constitution and temperature
  on magnetic susceptibility in crystalline media. They discuss the molecular field,
  its effects on the energy and ultimate tensile strength of crystalline structures,
  and its relation to the change in volume during crystallization.
topics:
- Molecular Field
- Crystalline Media
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Molecular Constitution
- Temperature Effects
