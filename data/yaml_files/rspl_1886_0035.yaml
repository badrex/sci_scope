scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This article presents a detailed anatomical study of the brachial plexus, examining
  the distribution of motor and sensory nerves in the human arm. It also includes
  an investigation of the effects of magnetization on the length of iron wires under
  tension, revealing that beyond a certain point, the wires may retract instead of
  elongate.
