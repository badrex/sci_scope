scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author presents a new method for achieving extreme dryness in hygrometry
  using quicklime in a closed vessel. This method produces a fixed degree of dryness
  and has been successfully replicated by other researchers, making it a valuable
  tool for hygrometry and meteorology.
