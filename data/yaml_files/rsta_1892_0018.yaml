revised_title: A New Approach to the Mathematical Theory of Electromagnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author proposes a new approach to the mathematical theory of electromagnetism,
  using Lagrangian mechanics to analyze the interdependence of electric and magnetic
  fields. The author aims to develop a single application of dynamical reasoning to
  derive all of Maxwell's equations and demonstrate the relationship between electrostatics,
  electrodynamics, magnetism, and electromagnetism.
