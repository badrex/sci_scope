revised_title: A Study of Air Compression in Sea Water at Various Depths
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The author investigates the compression of air under water at different depths
  using two different instruments, a glass bottle and a glass cylinder. The experiments
  reveal that the compression of air is directly proportional to the depth of immersion
  in saltwater. This information can be useful for divers and those using diving bells
  for underwater exploration and recovery of lost items.
