scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Analysis
tldr: Henry Fox Talbot presents a paper on the reduction of certain parabolic curve
  arcs, discussing the possibility of universally applying algebraic methods to these
  reductions. He provides numerous examples and hopes to present the underlying principles
  in the future.
