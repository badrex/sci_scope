revised_title: 'Innovations in Thermophones: Enhancing Sound Production through Wollaston
  Wire Treatment'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Engineering
tldr: The authors describe the development of improved thermophones using a Wollaston
  wire treated with acid, resulting in increased practical utility and enhanced sound
  production. They also discuss the importance of cover size and material in the resonance
  and acoustic effect of the thermophones.
