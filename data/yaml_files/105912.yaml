tldr: M. Pingre, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, shares his observations
  of the 1769 transit of Venus with the Royal Society of London. He discusses the
  methods used to determine the latitude and longitude of his observatory in Martinique
  and St. Domingo, as well as the observations made by various astronomers. The observations
  were used to calculate the Sun's parallax, which is crucial for determining the
  scale of the solar system.
