scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: John Hadley presents a spirit level that can be fixed to a quadrant to determine
  latitude at sea when the horizon is not visible. The instrument uses a glass tube
  filled with spirit of wine and a scale of degrees to measure the altitude of celestial
  objects. This method allows for approximate latitude determination in calm weather
  and is useful for navigational purposes.
