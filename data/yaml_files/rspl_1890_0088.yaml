scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a preliminary note on the development of a numerical registration
  system for colors, which can reproduce any color by mixing three primary colors
  (red, green, and violet) in different proportions. This method allows for accurate
  color reproduction and can be used to register colors in various lighting conditions.
