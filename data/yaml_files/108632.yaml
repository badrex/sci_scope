revised_title: Diversity of Fructification in Sphaeriaceous Fungi
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mycology & Fungal Biology
tldr: The author investigates the reproductive organs of certain Sphaeriaceous fungi
  and discovers diverse forms of fructification within the same plant. This polymorphism
  has implications for fungal systematics and taxonomy, as it may lead to the reclassification
  of several genera and species.
