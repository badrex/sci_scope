scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Astronomy & Solar Physics
tldr: The authors present their research on solar physics, focusing on the heliographical
  positions and areas of sunspots observed using the Kew Photoheliograph during 1862
  and 1863. They describe the methods used in the reductions and measurements, providing
  a detailed account of the process and the necessary observational data for determining
  the sunspots' heliographical coordinates.
