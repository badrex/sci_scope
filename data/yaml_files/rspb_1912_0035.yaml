  Tissues'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author presents a new method of examining normal and diseased tissues using
  intra-vitam staining, which involves injecting dyes into animals to visualize cellular
  structures and reactions. This technique allows for better understanding of tissue
  behavior in life-like conditions and has potential applications in various fields
  of biology and medicine.
