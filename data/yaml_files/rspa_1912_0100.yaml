revised_title: Investigation of the Spectrum of Ionium and Impurities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of ionium and find that the spectrum is
  identical to that of thorium, with the presence of about five strong scandium lines
  in the ionium preparation. They estimate that ionium is present in the active preparation
  to not more than 1 or 2 percent, and the maximum value of the ionium period cannot
  exceed 12,000 years.
