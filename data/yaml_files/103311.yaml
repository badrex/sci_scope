revised_title: Advantages of Observing Moon's Appulses to the Hyades for Astronomical
  Research
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: The author proposes observing the Moon's frequent appulses to the Hyades star
  cluster during the next three years to improve geographical and astronomical research,
  particularly in determining longitude at sea. This method offers a more accurate
  and manageable way to observe occultations of stars by the Moon, which can help
  settle land and sea boundaries.
