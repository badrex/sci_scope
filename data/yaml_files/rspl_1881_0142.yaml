revised_title: On the Recent Bond of Homology between Appendages of Lucifer and the
  Crustacea
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author discusses the relationship between the appendages of Lucifer and
  Crustacea, arguing that recent and persistent bonds of homology exist between them.
  They also propose a modified version of Darwin's Pangenesis Hypothesis, which accounts
  for phenomena of serial homology and symmetry and removes difficulties in the theory
  of natural selection.
