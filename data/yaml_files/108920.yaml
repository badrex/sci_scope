revised_title: On the Communication of Vibration from a Vibrating Body to a Surrounding
  Gas
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: The author investigates the communication of vibration from a vibrating body
  to surrounding gas, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of sound propagation
  in hydrogen gas. The study reveals that the high velocity of sound propagation in
  hydrogen gas accounts for the observed results in previous experiments, providing
  a new explanation for the phenomenon.
