scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Metabolism
tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments using a calorimeter to measure the
  heat given out by the human body. They find that the mean heat emitted remains relatively
  consistent in consecutive half-hours and is influenced by factors such as food consumption
  and time of day.
