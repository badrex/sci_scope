revised_title: Experiments on the Depolarization of Light and the Discovery of Doubly
  Polarizing Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: David Brewster investigates the depolarization of light by various mineral,
  animal, and vegetable bodies, and introduces the concept of doubly polarizing crystals.
  He also explores the optical properties of substances like gum arabic, wax, and
  hair, and their effects on polarized light.
