revised_title: Investigating the Absorption of Salt of Steel in the Lacteal Vessels
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to determine if salt of steel can enter the
  lacteal vessels and finds that it does not due to its astringency. This discovery
  suggests that salt of steel's medicinal properties are primarily due to its effects
  on the stomach and primae viae, rather than its impact on the blood or other animal
  fluids.
