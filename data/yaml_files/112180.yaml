tldr: The author investigates the development of certain infusoria and the role of
  monads in their transformation. He observes that monadine forms, such as Cercomonades,
  are the earlier or larval stages of ciliated infusoria, which become metamorphosed
  in the progress of development. This challenges the concept of spontaneous generation
  as proposed by Pouchet and his disciples.
