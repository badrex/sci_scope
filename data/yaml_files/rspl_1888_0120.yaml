revised_title: 'The Spinal Curvature in Aboriginal Australians: A Comparative Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Anatomy & Evolution
tldr: The author examines the spinal curvature in an aboriginal Australian and compares
  it to European spines, finding significant differences in the lumbo-vertebral index
  and the degree of lumbar curve. The study suggests that these differences are due
  to differences in daily habits and the need for flexibility and agility in the aboriginal
  population.
