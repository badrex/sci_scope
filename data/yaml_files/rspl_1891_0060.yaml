revised_title: Spectral Analysis of the New Star in Auriga
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author analyzes the spectrum of a new star in Auriga and finds that the
  dark lines are more refrangible than the bright ones. The relative velocity deduced
  from the observations is about 600 miles per second, suggesting that two meteor
  swarms may have collided, with each moving at a rate of 300 miles per second.
