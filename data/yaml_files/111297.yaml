scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mechanics
tldr: This paper by William Thomson introduces a mathematical theory of elasticity,
  defining stress and strain and their geometrical relations. It also discusses the
  concept of principal strain types and their importance in understanding the behavior
  of elastic solids. The paper further explores the potential energy of elasticity
  and its applications in crystal optics and Faraday's optical property of transparent
  bodies under magnetic force.
