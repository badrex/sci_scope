revised_title: Investigation of Heat Conduction in Liquids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to measure the conduction of heat in liquids
  using a platinum wire and a bridge arrangement. They find that the rate of heat
  conduction increases with the rise in temperature and provide a mathematical formula
  to describe the temperature distribution in the liquid.
