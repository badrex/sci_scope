  of the Diamond
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the quantity of carbon in carbonic acid and the nature
  of the diamond through a series of experiments using a unique apparatus. They find
  that charcoal acts as a hygrometer and that the increase in weight of charcoal samples
  is mainly due to the absorption of water from the air. The authors also determine
  the amount of carbon in various carbonaceous substances and discuss the importance
  of accurate measurements in their experiments.
