revised_title: On the Structure and Composition of Nerves and the Mechanism of Sensation
  and Voluntary Motion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the structure and composition of nerves through microscopical
  and chemical analysis, concluding that they consist of membranous tubes with oily
  content. He proposes that sensation and voluntary motion occur through undulations
  propagated along these tubes, rather than through electricity or galvanism.
