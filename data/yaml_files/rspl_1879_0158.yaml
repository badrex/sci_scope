revised_title: The Aluminium-Iodine Reaction and its Applications in Chemistry
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic & Organic Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the aluminium-iodine reaction, a unique chemical process
  that can decompose alcohols and ethers. They discover that this reaction can produce
  new compounds, distinguish between different organic compounds, and provide insight
  into their constitution. The authors also study the properties and general behavior
  of aluminium alcohols, which are solid at room temperature and can be distilled
  at reduced pressures.
