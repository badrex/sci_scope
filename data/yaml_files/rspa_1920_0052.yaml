revised_title: 'A Re-Examination of the Light Scattered by Gases: Polarization Experiments
  on Helium and Argon'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author re-examines the light scattered by gases, focusing on helium and
  argon, and investigates their polarization properties. The study confirms the theoretical
  relation between refractivity and scattered light intensity, while also revealing
  the challenges in accurately measuring the polarization of helium due to its extremely
  faint scattering.
