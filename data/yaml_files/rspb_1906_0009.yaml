revised_title: The Tuberculo-Opsonic Power in Tubercular Infection
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of determining the presence or absence
  of tubercular infection by examining a patient's blood and tissue fluids. They find
  that the tuberculo-opsonic power of the blood is low in strictly localized tuberculosis
  cases and fluctuates in cases associated with constitutional disturbance, suggesting
  potential applications in diagnosing tubercular infection.
