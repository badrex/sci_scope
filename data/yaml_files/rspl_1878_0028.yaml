revised_title: On a Third Order Differential Equation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Functions
tldr: The author presents a third-order differential equation and its integration
  using previously obtained results. The equation is related to Kummer's work on Gaussian
  series and can be integrated using hypergeometric functions.
topics:
- Differential Equations
- Mathematical Analysis
- Mathematical Functions
- Hypergeometric Functions
- Gaussian Series
