revised_title: 'Influence of Coal-Dust in Colliery Explosions: Experimental Apparatus
  and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mining & Mineral Resources
tldr: The author describes a new experimental apparatus and series of experiments
  to study the influence of coal-dust in colliery explosions. The findings reveal
  that coal-dust significantly increases the average distance of flame travel in an
  explosion, with an average of 70 feet, and occasionally reaching up to 104 feet.
  The author also discusses the importance of inertia and frictional resistance of
  air in the gallery, and provides insights from three real colliery explosions in
  1880.
