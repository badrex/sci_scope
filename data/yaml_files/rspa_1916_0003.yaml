revised_title: A Method of Avoiding Collision at Sea using Simultaneous Signals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Navigation
tldr: The author proposes a method to avoid collisions at sea by using simultaneous
  signals, such as wireless signals and sound signals, to determine the distance between
  ships. This method allows ships to predict the risk of collision and take necessary
  actions to avoid it.
