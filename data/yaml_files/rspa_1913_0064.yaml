revised_title: Investigating the Low Potential Discharge in Highly Exhausted Vacua
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates a peculiar form of low potential discharge in highly
  exhausted vacua and discovers that the discharge is facilitated by the presence
  of magnetic fields. The discharge potential is significantly reduced due to the
  spiral path of electrons, which ionize the gas and lower the potential gradient.
