tldr: The Swedish government plans to send a new polar expedition to explore the Arctic
  region, with the main objective of penetrating northward from Spitzbergen. The expedition
  will be equipped with a strong screw-steamer and will include several naturalists.
  The goal is to gather data on the rising of the land, bore watermarks along the
  shores, and potentially conduct pendulum observations if a suitable pendulum is
  obtained.
