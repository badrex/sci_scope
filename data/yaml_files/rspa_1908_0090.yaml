revised_title: The Determination of the Boiling Point of Sulphur Using the Constant-Pressure
  Air Thermometer
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors describe an experiment to determine the boiling point of sulfur
  using a constant-pressure air thermometer. They discuss the apparatus, methodology,
  and corrections applied to the measurements, but note that the results are not considered
  final due to uncertainty in the glass expansion.
