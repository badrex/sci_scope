revised_title: Artificial Formation of Diamond through High Pressure and Temperature
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Material Science & Crystallography
tldr: Sir William Crookes investigates the possibility of forming diamonds under high
  pressure and temperature conditions using residues from closed-vessel explosions.
  He successfully identifies and confirms the presence of diamonds in the residues,
  suggesting that this method can artificially produce diamonds.
