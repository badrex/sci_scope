revised_title: Zonal Fission and Tissue Fragmentation in Lineus gesserensis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Development
tldr: The study investigates the process of fission in Lineus gesserensis, revealing
  that the zones of fission coincide with the external markings on its body. The process
  occurs through the agency of digestive fluids and involves the exertion of opposing
  forces, leading to the solution of body-wall tissues and eventual fragmentation.
