scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts an experimental study on a dog with a Vella's fistula to
  investigate the factors contributing to intestinal rest and movement. The study
  reveals that contractions and movements of the fistulous intestine are influenced
  by hunger, mental impressions, and physical activity, providing insights into the
  complex interplay of factors affecting the digestive system.
