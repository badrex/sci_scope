revised_title: 'The Structure and Function of Vertebrate Taste Organs: A Study on
  Frog''s Tongue'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the minute structure of the taste organs in vertebrate
  animals, focusing on the frog's tongue. He discovers two types of papillae with
  distinct structures and functions, conical and fungiform. The fungiform papillae
  contain blood vessels, nerves, and muscular fibers, and are responsible for the
  sensation of taste, while the conical papillae are associated with touch. The author
  also describes the neuro-vascular area, where nerves and blood vessels interact,
  and the ciliary movement of the fungiform papillae, which aids in absorption and
  removal of foreign particles.
