revised_title: Investigating the Superheating Effect on Platinum-Silver Resistance
  in Continuous-Flow Calorimetry
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author tests the accuracy of his previous experiments on the specific heat
  of water using a continuous-flow calorimeter and addresses the concerns about superheating
  of the platinum-silver resistance. The results show that the error due to superheating
  is not more than 1 part in 10,000, confirming the reliability of the continuous
  calorimetry method.
