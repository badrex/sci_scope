revised_title: The Ancestry of Helioporid Corals and Polytremacis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Paleobiology
tldr: The author argues that the recent blue coral Heliopora is closely related to
  the Paleozoic Heliolites, despite some authorities claiming otherwise. The author
  suggests that Heliopora has descended from the Paleozoic Heliolitidae by degeneration
  in size and an increase in the number of coenenchymal caeca. Polytremacis, a genus
  of eocene and cretaceous corals, is considered as a connecting link between the
  two genera.
