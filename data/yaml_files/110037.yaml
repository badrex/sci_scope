revised_title: Davy's Electro-Magnetic Phenomenon Experiment
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the interaction between a magnet and mercury in
  an electric circuit, discovering a new phenomenon involving the elevation of mercury
  into cones and the flow of waves from these cones. This phenomenon challenges the
  idea of a single imponderable fluid causing electro-magnetic results.
