revised_title: The Discovery of a Milk-Curdling Ferment in the Pancreas
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author, Dr. William Roberts, discovers a milk-curdling ferment in the pancreas,
  which he calls 'pancreatic rennet.' He compares it to the curdling agent in the
  stomach, suggesting that they may be the same ferment. The study contributes to
  the understanding of digestion and the role of the pancreas in the process.
