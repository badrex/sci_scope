revised_title: A Caution on Examining Specific Gravity of Solids by Weighing in Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author cautions against the potential errors in measuring the specific gravity
  of solids, particularly porous bodies, by weighing them in water. He suggests using
  an air pump or boiling water to remove air from the pores before weighing, to obtain
  accurate results.
