tldr: The author describes a patient who died from an impostumation of the liver.
  Upon autopsy, six quarts of purulent, thick, and fetid reddish-brown matter were
  extracted from the lowest lobes of the liver. The patient's symptoms included vomiting
  and purging, and the impostumation had compressed the right kidney. This case study
  provides insight into the pathology of liver tumors and their effects on the surrounding
  organs.
