revised_title: Electrical Nature of the Power Possessed by Actiniae
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Zoology
tldr: The author investigates the electrical nature of the power possessed by Actiniae,
  marine invertebrates, and demonstrates their ability to cause muscular contractions
  in frog limbs through electrical power. The experiments show that the common Actiniae
  of our shores are gifted with electrical power, which can cause physiological effects
  similar to other electricities.
