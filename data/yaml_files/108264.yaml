scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrogeology & Hydrology
tldr: The author investigates the temperature of springs, wells, and rivers in India
  and Egypt, observing that the temperature of deep wells and springs is slightly
  higher than the mean temperature of the air. The study also reveals that saline
  and cold springs occur within a few feet of thermal and freshwater springs, and
  that the temperature of shallow exposed wells and rivers is subject to significant
  diurnal fluctuations.
