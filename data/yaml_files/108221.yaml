revised_title: The Theoretical Explanation of a New Polarity in Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, G. B. Airy, investigates the phenomenon of light polarization using
  a prism and mica, discovering that bands form when light is out of focus. He presents
  a theoretical explanation based on the wave theory of light, which involves the
  asymmetry of bands and the position of the bands in the spectrum.
