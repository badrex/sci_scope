revised_title: Interferential Method for Colour Photography
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author describes a method for creating colour photographs using the interferential
  method, where the colours are due to interference. The process involves using a
  transparent photographic film and a metallic mirror during exposure, resulting in
  fixed colour photographs visible by reflected light. The colours are formed by standing
  waves in the film, which act as a continuous grating reflecting the specific luminous
  ray that created it.
