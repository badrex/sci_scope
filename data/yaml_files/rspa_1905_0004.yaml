revised_title: Theory of Reflection of Light Near the Polarizing Angle
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the reflection and refraction of light at the boundary
  of two transparent isotropic media, focusing on the behavior of light near the polarizing
  angle. The study reveals that Fresnel's formulae are applicable to an ideal abrupt
  transition between media, but departures from these formulae occur due to the presence
  of a 'layer of transition' between the media.
