revised_title: The Electromagnetic Inertia of the Lorentz Electron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Relativity
tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic inertia of the Lorentz electron,
  comparing it to previous work by G. W. Walker. The study finds that the longitudinal
  electromagnetic mass agrees with Walker's first expression, while the transverse
  electromagnetic mass is derived from the author's own method, differing from Walker's
  result.
