revised_title: Investigating the Circulation of Blood through Sphygmograph-Trace Analysis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author examines the sphygmograph-trace to study the circulation of blood
  and the relationship between pulse rate, pulse beat length, and the duration of
  cardiac and arterial systoles. The study provides insights into the physiological
  changes occurring in the heart and the aorta, and the impact of pulse rate on the
  syspasis, the time during which the ventricles raise the pressure of their contained
  blood.
