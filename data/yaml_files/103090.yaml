scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Richard Bradley investigates the motion of sap in plants, examining the role
  of roots, bark, and the different layers of a plant's structure in the process.
  He also suggests that each layer of bark may have different juices with distinct
  properties, which could have various effects on plant health.
