revised_title: Investigation of the Magnetic Properties of Manganese and Manganese
  Steels
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic properties of manganese and manganese steels,
  discovering that cast manganese exhibits ferromagnetism and that its magnetic properties
  are influenced by heating, temperature, and sample size. The study also suggests
  that the ferromagnetism of cast manganese is due to hydrogen.
