revised_title: Further Analysis of Sun-Spot Observations at South Kensington
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics
tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses the results of sun-spot observations
  made at South Kensington, focusing on the changes in spectral lines during the minimum
  and maximum periods. The study suggests that the solar atmosphere's temperature
  and disturbance levels affect the presence of terrestrial elements' absorption lines,
  providing insight into the solar atmosphere's behavior.
