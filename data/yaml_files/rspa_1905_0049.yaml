revised_title: On the Influence of Molecular Collisions on the Constitution and Visibility
  of Spectrum Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the impact of molecular collisions and motion on the
  constitution and visibility of spectrum lines, finding that collisions cause a widening
  of the lines and affect their visibility. The study also highlights the importance
  of considering the distribution of free paths among molecules when analyzing spectrum
  lines.
