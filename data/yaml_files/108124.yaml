tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the index of refraction and
  the length of a wave for each definite ray throughout the spectrum, using a formula
  derived from the theory of undulations. The study examines the refractive indices
  for seven definite rays in ten different media, providing a tabular statement of
  the results and comparing them with observed values.
