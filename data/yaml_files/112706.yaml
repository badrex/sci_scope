  Carboniferous Formation'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleontology & Stratigraphy
tldr: The authors describe a new genus, Paleocoryne, of Tubularine Hydrozoa found
  in the Carboniferous formation. The genus contains two species and is part of a
  new family within the Tubulaiidae. These forms were discovered in the lower shales
  of the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire coal-field and are determined to be parasitic upon
  Fenestellae. Their discovery brings the order of Tubularine Hydrozoa into geological
  relation with the Sertularian Graptolites of the Silurian formation and the rare
  medusoids of the Solenhofen stones.
