revised_title: A Method for Measuring the Resistance of a Conductor, Battery, or Telegraph-Line
  Influenced by Unknown Earth-Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the resistance of a conductor, battery,
  or telegraph line influenced by unknown earth currents using a single deflection
  of a galvanometer of unknown resistance. This method can also be used to determine
  the internal resistance of a battery.
