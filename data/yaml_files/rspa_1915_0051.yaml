revised_title: On the Significance of Probable Errors in Frequency Distributions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Probability
tldr: The author investigates the conditions under which the probable errors of frequency
  distributions have real significance, focusing on moment coefficients and their
  relationship to normality. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  the distribution's skewness and the need for accurate representation when dealing
  with statistical constants.
