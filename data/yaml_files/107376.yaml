scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: John Pond, the Astronomer Royal, determined the north polar distances and proper
  motion of thirty fixed stars. He compared his catalog with Dr. Bradley's from 1756
  and observed that the error in the earlier catalog did not exceed a quarter of a
  second. He also provided a table of mean barometer and thermometer readings for
  easy correction in other refraction tables.
