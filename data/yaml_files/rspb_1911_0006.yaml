  A Preliminary Note on Atoxyl, Vaccines, Cold, X-Rays, and Leucocytic Extract'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences

tldr: This study investigates the effects of various treatments, including atoxyl,
  vaccines, cold, X-rays, and leucocytic extract, on animals infected with trypanosomes.
  The results show that small doses of atoxyl can prolong the life of infected animals
  and stimulate division of the parasites, while large doses can temporarily clear
  the parasites from the peripheral blood. Vaccine treatment did not show significant
  immunity-conferment in animals. The study suggests that atoxyl may not be a specific
  treatment for trypanosomiasis and that further research is needed to determine the
  most effective treatment methods.
