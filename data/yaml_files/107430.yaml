revised_title: Investigating the Optical Properties and Structure of Agate
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the optical properties and structure of agate, discovering
  that it polarizes light and produces unique effects such as nebulous light and double
  refraction. The author also explores the different structures within agate and their
  relation to its optical properties.
