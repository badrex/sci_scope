tldr: The Hydrostatic Log is an invention by E. L. Berthon that measures a ship's
  speed by using a column of mercury, unaffected by factors like draught of water,
  pitching, and rolling. The device works on the principle of Pitot's tube and features
  a compensation mechanism using two columns of water and air to balance out the effects
  of varying distances from the waterline. The indicator can be placed anywhere on
  the ship, and it also indicates the true course or leeway of the vessel.
