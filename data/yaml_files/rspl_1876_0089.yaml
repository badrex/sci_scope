revised_title: Influence of Height in the Atmosphere on Diurnal Variation of Earth's
  Magnetic Force
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author examines the influence of height in the atmosphere on the diurnal
  variation of the Earth's magnetic force using various instruments and observations.
  The results show that the change in horizontal force is less at higher altitudes,
  suggesting a significant magnetic influence from the medium between observation
  points.
