revised_title: Investigation of Absorption Spectra of Benzene and its Homologues at
  Different Temperatures and Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of benzene and its homologues
  at different temperatures and pressures, discovering that the position of substituted
  hydrogens influences the number and position of bands in the spectra. The study
  confirms that the mode of vibration within the benzene nucleus is largely unaffected
  by side-chain substitution.
