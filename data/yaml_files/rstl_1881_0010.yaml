revised_title: An Investigation into the Thermal Conductivity of Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This article presents experiments on the thermal conductivity of water, using
  a method devised by Sir William Thomson. The experiments were conducted in a sheet-iron
  tank and a wooden vessel, with the aid of students and experimental scholars. The
  results provide insights into the heat transfer and conductivity of water, with
  implications for understanding its properties and potential applications.
