scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the effectiveness of intravenous antimony treatment
  for trypanosomiasis in dogs and rats. They find that intravenous injections of antimony
  metal are more effective than its salts and that the metal is taken up by leucocytes,
  providing a long-lasting trypanocidal effect. The authors also report on the use
  of intraperitoneal injections of antimony in rats and the importance of the timing
  of treatment for success.
