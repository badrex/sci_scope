revised_title: 'Welding Temperatures in Iron and Steel: A Comparison with Ice Regelation'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the phenomenon of welding in iron and steel, demonstrating
  that it is identical to the process of regelation in ice. They conduct experiments
  using an electric welder and a recording pyrometer to measure the temperature at
  the point of welding, finding that wrought iron at welding temperatures exhibits
  the same property of cooling under pressure as demonstrated by Lord Kelvin in freezing
  water.
