revised_title: Investigating the Conduction of the Pulse Wave and the Measurement
  of Arterial Pressure
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Vascular Medicine
tldr: The authors investigate the conduction of the pulse wave and the measurement
  of arterial pressure, focusing on the role of arterial wall lability and the effect
  of surrounding tissues on pulse wave conduction. They demonstrate that deformation
  of the arterial lumen plays a significant role in the obliteration of the pulse
  wave, and that the use of a sphygmomanometer can provide accurate readings when
  properly applied.
