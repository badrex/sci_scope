revised_title: On the Tension of Recently Formed Liquid Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: Lord Rayleigh investigates the tension of recently formed liquid surfaces, specifically
  soap films, and finds that the formation of a coating with lower capillary force
  plays a significant role in their capability of extension. He also examines the
  effect of atmospheric carbonic acid and the addition of caustic potash on the properties
  of the liquid surface.
