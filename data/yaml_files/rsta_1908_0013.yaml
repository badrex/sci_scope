revised_title: Investigation of the Silver Voltameter and its Variations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: This study examines various forms of silver voltameters and their performance,
  focusing on the effects of anode, kathode, and electrolyte conditions on the accuracy
  of the instrument. The researchers investigate the influence of factors such as
  electrode materials, electrolyte concentration, and temperature on the mass of silver
  deposited per ampere-second.
