revised_title: A Comparative Study of Temperature in London and Edinburgh
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: John Roebuck compares the average temperatures of London and Edinburgh using
  thermometer readings from 1763 to 1772. He finds that London's mean temperature
  is slightly higher than Edinburgh's, with the difference being more pronounced during
  the hottest months of the year. Roebuck attributes this difference to Edinburgh's
  proximity to the sea and suggests further research on the effects of latitude and
  altitude on temperature.
