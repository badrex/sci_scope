scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Edm. Halley investigates the relationship between mercury levels in barometers
  and altitude, as well as the expansion of air under varying pressures. He develops
  a method to determine the height of a location given the height of the mercury in
  a barometer and vice versa, and discusses the limitations of his findings.
