revised_title: On the Absorption and Dialytic Separation of Gases by Colloid Septa
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloid Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the absorption and separation of gases by colloid septa,
  specifically caoutchouc, and discovers that gases with higher solubility and lower
  density in liquids pass through rubber membranes more readily. The study provides
  insights into the mechanisms of gas absorption and separation using colloid septa
  and rubber materials.
