revised_title: A Comparative Analysis of Fluorescent X-ray Spectra
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption and properties of fluorescent X-ray radiations
  emitted by various elements, comparing the spectra of Group K and Group L. They
  find that radiations with the same penetrating power in aluminum are absorbed to
  the same extent in other elements, suggesting a similarity in their nature.
