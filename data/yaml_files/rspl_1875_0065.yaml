scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: In this Bakerian Lecture, Prof. T. Andrews investigates the gaseous state of
  matter, focusing on carbonic acid gas, and examines the effects of high pressure
  on its properties. He finds that the coefficients of expansion and elastic force
  change with pressure and temperature, and that the law of Gay-Lussac does not hold
  true in the ordinary gaseous state.
