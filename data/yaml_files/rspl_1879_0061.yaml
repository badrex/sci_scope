scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Probability
tldr: The authors explore the geometric mean as a method for treating measurements
  that naturally group around this value. They discuss its applications, including
  the law of facility and the concept of quartiles, and present a graphical representation
  of the method.
