tldr: George Graham observed the solar eclipse in Fleet Street, London, using a telescope
  with a micrometer to measure the eclipse's duration and extent. His observations
  were consistent with Dr. Halley's calculations, and he noted that the sky was clear
  during the event, except for a narrow cloud that obscured part of the sun's disk
  near the end.
