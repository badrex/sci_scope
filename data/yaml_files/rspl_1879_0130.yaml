scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Climate
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the existence of a
  diurnal variation in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Observations were
  made at Grasmere in Westmoreland during the summer and autumn of 1879, using a large
  volume of air to enhance the accuracy of the results. The study found that there
  was no significant diurnal variation in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.
