revised_title: Investigating the Impact of a Sphere with a Liquid Surface through
  Instantaneous Photography
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: This study examines the impact of a sphere with a liquid surface using instantaneous
  photography. The authors investigate the differences between the splash of a rough
  and polished sphere and explore the causes of these differences. They also analyze
  the influence of factors such as dust, surface temperature, and viscosity on the
  splash behavior.
