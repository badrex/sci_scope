revised_title: 'Condensation of Gases at the Surface of Glass: An Investigation into
  the Phenomenon and its Effects'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the condensation of gases at the surface of glass and
  its effects on vacuum technology. They find that heating the glass can release trapped
  air and moisture, improving the vacuum. The author also analyzes the composition
  of the gas released, finding a significant amount of carbonic acid gas.
