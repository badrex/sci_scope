revised_title: Investigation of Hygroscopic Action in Cotton
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Climate
tldr: The authors investigate the hygroscopic action of cotton by exposing it to various
  humidity levels and measuring the temperature changes and moisture absorption. They
  find that true equilibrium between cotton and its atmosphere is impossible, and
  that the absorption process continuously diminishes. The study provides a comprehensive
  understanding of the relationship between hygroscopicity, humidity, and temperature
  change in cotton.
