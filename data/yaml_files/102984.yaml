tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment at a Royal Society meeting to study the
  effect of air rarefaction on sound. He observed that as the air pressure decreased,
  the sound from a bell became weaker and more distant-sounding. When the air was
  reintroduced, the sound became louder and clearer.
