revised_title: Sun and Moon's Influence on Earth's Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetosphere & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the variations in the Earth's daily mean horizontal
  magnetic force caused by the Sun's rotation and the Moon's synodical and tropical
  revolutions. The study reveals that the Sun's rotation and the Moon's positions
  relative to the Sun and the equatorial plane have a significant impact on these
  variations.
