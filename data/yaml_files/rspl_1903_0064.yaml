revised_title: Measurement of Oxygen's Pressure Coefficient at Constant Volume and
  Different Initial Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Gas Properties
tldr: The authors investigate the pressure coefficient of oxygen at constant volume
  and different initial pressures, using a method that involves generating, liquefying,
  and purifying oxygen, and measuring the pressure changes. They find that the pressure
  coefficient is higher than previously determined for nitrogen and hydrogen, and
  discuss possible explanations for the difference.
