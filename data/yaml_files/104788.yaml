revised_title: A Method for Weighing the Strength of Electrical Effluvia
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author describes a method for weighing the strength of electrical effluvia
  by using a balance to measure the force exerted by electrical charges on non-electrical
  bodies. The method allows for comparison of different electrical forces and has
  the potential to provide new insights into the properties of electricity.
