revised_title: On the Permanent Temperature of Conductors and Surface Conductivity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Thermal Conductivity
tldr: The author investigates the permanent temperature of conductors carrying electric
  currents and examines the effect of different insulating coatings on the efficiency
  of heat emission. The experiments reveal that certain coatings, such as amalgamation
  with tin and mercury, improve the conductor's ability to dissipate heat, while others,
  like bare or polished surfaces, may hinder it.
