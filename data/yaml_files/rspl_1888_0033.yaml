revised_title: Investigating Motor Functions of Cranial and Cervical Nerves in Monkeys
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Anatomy
tldr: The authors investigate the motor functions of cranial and cervical nerves in
  monkeys, specifically focusing on cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII, as
  well as the first three cervical nerves. They provide detailed observations and
  findings on the movements evoked by stimulating these nerves, challenging some previously
  held views on their functions and distribution.
