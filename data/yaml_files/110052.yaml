revised_title: Investigating Astronomical Refractions and Atmospheric Heights
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author examines the phenomenon of astronomical refractions, considering
  various methods for calculating refractions and the effects of atmospheric density
  and temperature. He suggests a finite height for the atmosphere and investigates
  the motion of light according to central forces, comparing his results with observed
  data from astronomers.
