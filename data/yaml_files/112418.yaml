tldr: The author examines the mineral constituents of the Breitenbach meteorite and
  identifies two minerals. The first is a green mineral with a prismatic system and
  nearly approximates the formula of olivine. The second mineral is silica, possibly
  tridymite, with a distinct crystalline system and lower density than quartz.
