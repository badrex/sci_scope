revised_title: Determination of Osmotic Pressures in Solutions through Vapour Pressure
  Measurements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Solutions
tldr: The authors describe a method to determine osmotic pressures of solutions by
  measuring their vapor pressures using Ostwald and Walker's dynamic method. They
  discuss the modifications made to the method to improve accuracy and present the
  final apparatus design for future experiments.
