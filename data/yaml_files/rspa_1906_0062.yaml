revised_title: 'Investigation of Amphoteric Electrolytes: Methyl Derivatives of Para-Aminobenzoic
  Acid and Glycine'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the affinity constants of amphoteric electrolytes, specifically
  methyl derivatives of para-aminobenzoic acid and glycine. They determine the basic
  and acidic constants using various methods, including catalysis, solubility, and
  conductivity measurements, and discuss the influence of introducing methyl groups
  into the amino-acid structure.
