scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental Health & Sanitation
tldr: This study investigates the effect of floor-deafening on the sanitary condition
  of dwelling houses, finding that the quality of deafening material is directly related
  to the class of house. In poorer houses, the presence of nitrogenous organic matter
  and chlorides in the deafening material can lead to serious air pollution and potential
  health issues.
