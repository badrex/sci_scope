revised_title: 'Electrical and Chemical Effects of the Explosion of Azoimide: A Study
  on Gas Disruption and Ion Reactions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical and chemical effects of the explosion
  of azoimide gas, finding that the energy required to produce the observed quantity
  of electricity is a small fraction of the energy set free by the explosion. They
  also observe an abnormal amount of electricity produced in some instances, which
  they attribute to unknown factors.
