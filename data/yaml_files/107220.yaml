revised_title: Observations on the Annual Parallax of a Lyrae and Refraction Formula
  Alterations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Astrometry
tldr: The author, John Brinkley, discusses his observations of the star a Lyrae to
  determine its annual parallax and finds a result of 2Â°52' as the parallax of the
  star's annual orbit. He also suggests a small alteration to Dr. Bradley's refraction
  formula based on his observations of different circumpolar stars and varying temperatures.
