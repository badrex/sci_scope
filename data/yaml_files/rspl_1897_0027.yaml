revised_title: 'Investigating Cathode and Lenard Rays: Charge and Properties'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Phenomena
tldr: This study investigates the properties and charge of cathode and Lenard rays,
  revealing that both carry a negative charge. The experiments demonstrate the behavior
  of these rays when interacting with thin films and screens, providing insights into
  the nature of these phenomena.
