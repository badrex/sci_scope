tldr: This paper describes a human skeleton from a Palaeolithic bed in Tilbury, Essex,
  discovered during dock excavations. The skeleton is determined to be from an aged
  male with great muscular strength, and the author deduces information about the
  individual's diet based on the worn teeth. A chemical analysis of the bones is provided
  by Dr. Walter Flight, and a section of the strata is included to determine the individual's
  time period.
