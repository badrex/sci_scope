revised_title: 'The Decomposition of Ethylene Under Heat: A Study of Temperature,
  Rate of Flow, and Heated Surface'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature, rate of flow, and heated
  surface on the decomposition of ethylene. The experiments reveal that varying these
  factors significantly impacts the amount of ethylene decomposed, with higher temperatures
  and increased flow rates leading to greater decomposition.
