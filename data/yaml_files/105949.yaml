revised_title: Eclipse Observation and Longitude Calculation in New-Found-Land
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Eclipses & Solar Observations
tldr: James Cook observed a solar eclipse at the Island of New-Found-Land in 1766,
  and using his observations, J. Bevis calculated the longitude of the place of observation.
  The results were compared with other observations, allowing for the determination
  of the difference in meridians.
