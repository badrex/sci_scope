scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Physics & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the effect of pressure on the arc spectra of titanium,
  finding that all examined lines were broadened by pressure, with the amount and
  type of broadening varying between lines. The researchers also observed an increase
  in the brightness of the arc under pressure and a shift in color from whitish to
  blue.
