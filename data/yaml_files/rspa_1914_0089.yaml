revised_title: 'Investigation of Heat Convection from Small Cylinders in a Fluid Stream:
  Determination of Convection Constants of Platinum Wires and Applications to Hot-Wire
  Anemometry'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the convection of heat from small cylinders in a fluid
  stream, focusing on the determination of convection constants of platinum wires.
  They apply this research to hot-wire anemometry, a method used to measure air velocity,
  and find that the theory provides a good account of the experiments.
