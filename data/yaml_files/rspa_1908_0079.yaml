revised_title: The Influence of Geological Age on Helium Accumulation in Minerals
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geochronology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between geological age and helium content
  in minerals, finding that older minerals tend to have lower helium ratios, suggesting
  that helium retention is often imperfect over time. This research has implications
  for measuring geological time and understanding the processes of radioactive decay
  in minerals.
