revised_title: Determination of Euler's Constant Using Large Numbers
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Approximation
tldr: The author calculates the numerical value of Euler's constant using a large
  number (n=10,000) and confirms the limits assigned to the value in a previous paper.
  The results suggest that further determination of the constant is not necessary.
