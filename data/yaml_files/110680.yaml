tldr: Faraday investigates the origin of electric force in the voltaic pile and examines
  how factors like heat and dilution affect the chemical affinities of substances
  in a circuit, influencing the electric current produced. He concludes that chemical
  action is sufficient to account for all the phenomena of the pile and disproves
  the existence of contact force in thermo-electricity.
