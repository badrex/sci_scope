  Currents'

tldr: Carlo Matteucci presents new experiments on muscular currents, confirming the
  independence of their intensity and duration from the nature of the gas and cerebro-spinal
  portion of the nervous system. He also discusses the influence of respiratory and
  circulatory systems, as well as various poisons and gases on the intensity of the
  muscular current. The author concludes that the property of muscles connected with
  electric currents is identical to contractility and is developed through chemical
  actions during muscle nutrition.
