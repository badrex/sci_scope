revised_title: Influence of Soil Nutrient and Moisture on Root Growth
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight investigates how the direction of root growth in plants
  is influenced by soil nutrients and moisture. He observes that roots tend to grow
  towards areas with more nutrients and moisture, and suggests that this behavior
  is guided by the plant's ability to attract and employ nutrients and moisture, rather
  than an animal-like instinct.
