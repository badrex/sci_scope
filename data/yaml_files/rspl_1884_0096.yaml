revised_title: On the Agency of Water in Volcanic Eruptions and Observations on the
  Thickness of Earth's Crust
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Volcanology
tldr: The author examines the role of water in volcanic eruptions and challenges the
  hypothesis that the rise of lava is caused by the expansion of high-pressure steam.
  He argues that water cannot penetrate to the depths required for this hypothesis
  and that there is no direct relationship between the discharge of lava and steam
  in eruptions.
