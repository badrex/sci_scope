revised_title: Comparative Study of Human and Elephant Membrana Tympani Structure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author compares the structure of the human membrana tympani to that of an
  elephant, noting differences in shape and muscle fiber attachment. The study suggests
  that the elephant's unique structure allows it to hear sounds at great distances,
  particularly lower tones.
