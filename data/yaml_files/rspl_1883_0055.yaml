revised_title: 'Influence of Pressure on the Temperature of Volatilization of Solids:
  Experiments with Ice and Camphor'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of pressure on the temperature of volatilization
  of solids, specifically ice and camphor, and find that solids have definite temperatures
  of evaporation or subliming points corresponding to definite pressures, similar
  to how liquids have boiling points.
topics:
- Chemical Thermodynamics
- Phase Transitions
- Sublimation
- Vapor Pressure
- Heat Transfer
