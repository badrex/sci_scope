  Toe'''
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Science & Botany
tldr: The author investigates the disease known as 'finger and toe' or 'clubbing'
  that affects various cruciferous plants. The disease is caused by a minute organism
  related to fungi, Plasmodiophora brassicae. The author demonstrates that the development
  of the disease is favored by the presence of acids and can be checked by the presence
  of alkalies. Lime and potash-containing manures are effective in sterilizing infected
  soil and preventing the disease in seedlings.
