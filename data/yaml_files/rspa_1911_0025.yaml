revised_title: Investigation of Soft Röntgen Radiation Properties
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors investigate the properties of soft Röntgen radiation produced by
  slow cathode rays impacting various metallic anticathodes. They measure the energy,
  absorption coefficients, and corpuscular emission of the radiation, providing insights
  into the dependence of these properties on the nature of the anticathode and the
  velocity of the parent cathode rays.
