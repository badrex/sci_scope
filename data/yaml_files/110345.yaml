revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Solar Rays on Magnetic Needle Oscillations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: William Snow Harris examines the effect of sunlight on the oscillations of a
  magnetic needle, finding that solar rays increase the apparent rate of oscillation
  in air and decrease it in a vacuum. He concludes that the phenomena are independent
  of the magnetic state of the bar and the influence of solar light.
