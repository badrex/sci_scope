revised_title: Infra-Red Emission and Absorption in Mercury, Zinc, and Cadmium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the infra-red emission and absorption spectra of mercury,
  zinc, and cadmium. They find that the absorption of certain wave lengths corresponds
  to the emission of other wave lengths, suggesting a relationship between emission
  and absorption in these elements.
