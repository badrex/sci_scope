revised_title: On the Electric Effect of Rotating a Dielectric in a Magnetic Field
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the electric effect of rotating a dielectric in a magnetic
  field and finds that the effect exists and is nearly equal to the amount predicted
  by the theory. The experiment confirms the theory of electromotive force in dielectrics
  as developed by H. A. Lorentz and Larmor.
