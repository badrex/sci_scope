tldr: Dr. John Wallis reports on a meteor seen in various locations in England on
  September 20, 1676. He speculates that it might have been a small comet passing
  close to Earth, based on its swift motion and the fact that it was seen at the same
  time in different regions. Wallis also discusses the possibility of the meteor being
  a Draco volans, a fiery meteor in the sky.
