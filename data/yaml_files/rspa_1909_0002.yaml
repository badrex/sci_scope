revised_title: 'The Charges on Ions Produced by Radium: Further Experiments and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Radiochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the charges on ions produced by radium and find that
  the negative ions have a consistent charge, while positive ions can have either
  a single or double atomic charge. They also observe that negative ions do not follow
  the simple laws of diffusion when the air is very dry, and discuss the effects of
  radioactivity and self-repulsion on their experiments.
