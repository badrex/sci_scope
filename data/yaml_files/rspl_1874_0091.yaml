revised_title: Investigating Cerebral Lobes and Asymmetry in the Human Brain
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the proportions of the cerebral lobes in humans and higher
  vertebrates, and investigates the asymmetry of cerebral convolutions in the human
  brain. The study suggests that some asymmetry is due to human right-handedness and
  that there is a relationship between stature and brain weight.
