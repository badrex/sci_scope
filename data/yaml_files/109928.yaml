scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Captain Edward Sabine conducted observations on the dip and variation of the
  magnetic needle and the intensity of the magnetic force during a voyage in search
  of a North-West Passage. The study involved using a dipping-needle and azimuth compasses
  to gather data on magnetic phenomena, highlighting the importance of understanding
  the errors caused by a ship's attraction on compasses in high latitudes for navigation.
