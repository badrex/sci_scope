  and its Implications for Transfusion
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Transfusion Medicine
tldr: The authors investigate the fate of red blood corpuscles when injected into
  the circulation of another animal of the same species. They discovered that the
  injected corpuscles are not accepted by their host and are treated as foreign, triggering
  the formation of antibodies. This has significant implications for blood transfusion
  in medicine.
