revised_title: 'The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast Juice: Part IV - Fermentation of Glucose,
  Mannose, and Fructose by Yeast Juice'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the fermentation of glucose, mannose, and fructose by
  yeast juice and find that fructose is fermented slightly more quickly than glucose
  and mannose. They also study the effect of phosphate on the fermentation process
  and observe that an optimum concentration of phosphate exists at which a maximum
  rate of fermentation occurs.
