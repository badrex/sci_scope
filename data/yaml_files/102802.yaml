  Diet'

scientific_subdiscipline: Human Biology & Evolution
tldr: In a letter to Dr. Tyson, Dr. Wallis discusses the historical debate on whether
  humans were naturally designed to consume flesh or plant-based foods. He examines
  the anatomical differences between carnivorous and herbivorous animals, suggesting
  that humans, with their unique digestive system and ability to reason, may not be
  naturally suited for a meat-based diet.
