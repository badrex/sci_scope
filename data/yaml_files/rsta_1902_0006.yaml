revised_title: On the Pear-Shaped Figure of Equilibrium of a Rotating Mass of Liquid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the pear-shaped equilibrium figure of a rotating mass
  of liquid using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis and finds that the change of notation
  facilitates reference to previous work on the subject.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Rotating Liquids
- Ellipsoidal Harmonic Analysis
- Equilibrium
- Geophysics
