revised_title: Observations and Experiments on Earth's Motion and Celestial Attraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: 'The author, Robert Hooke, attempts to prove the Earth''s motion by observing
  the parallax of stars. He describes his method of observing the star in the Dragon''s
  head and provides evidence for the Copernican system. Additionally, Hooke introduces
  a new system of the world based on three suppositions: celestial bodies have gravitational
  power, all bodies in direct motion continue in a straight line, and attractive powers
  are stronger the closer the body is to the center.'
