revised_title: The Structure and Symmetry of Diamond and Graphite
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Crystallography
tldr: The author examines the intimate structure of crystals, specifically cubic crystals
  with octahedral cleavage, and explores the atomic arrangement and symmetry in diamond
  and graphite. The study reveals that diamond has the closest possible atomic packing,
  while graphite has a more open arrangement, and discusses the implications of these
  structures on the physical properties of the two forms of carbon.
