revised_title: The Density of Niton and the Disintegration Theory
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the density and atomic weight of niton (radium emanation)
  using a sensitive balance and determine that it has an atomic weight of approximately
  222, supporting the disintegration theory of radioactive change.
