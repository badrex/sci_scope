revised_title: The Germinative Power of Seeds in Liquid Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the germination of various seeds after being exposed
  to liquid hydrogen, a temperature of -250Â°C. Despite the extreme cold, all seeds
  tested were found to germinate successfully, suggesting that seeds can withstand
  and recover from such extreme temperatures.
