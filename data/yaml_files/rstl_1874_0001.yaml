revised_title: Development of a Standard Voltaic Battery with Uniform Electromotive
  Force
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author, Latimer Clark, and Sir William Thomson investigate the development
  of a standard voltaic battery with a constant electromotive force. They create a
  battery using pure mercury and zinc electrodes, which maintains a uniform difference
  of electric potential between its poles and has a remarkably uniform and constant
  electromotive force.
