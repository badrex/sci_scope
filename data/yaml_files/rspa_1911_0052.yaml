revised_title: Investigation of the Equilibrium Diagram and Microstructure of Aluminium-Zinc
  Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the constitution of aluminium-zinc alloys through thermal
  and microscopic examinations. They determine a new equilibrium diagram for these
  alloys, revealing the solidus and liquidus lines, and discuss the microstructures
  and phase transformations that occur during cooling and heating processes.
topics:
- Aluminiu
- Equilibrium Diagram
- Microstructure
- Thermal Investigation
