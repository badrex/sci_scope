revised_title: A Detailed Analysis of a Clepsydra or Water-Clock
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Timekeeping
tldr: The article describes a water clock, or clepsydra, designed by Charles Hamilton.
  The clock uses a siphon to supply a constant and equal stream of water to a canal,
  which is then distributed into two vessels, raising a balance and ultimately turning
  gears to indicate the time. The mechanism is precise and efficient, with a fine
  chain and weights ensuring accurate movement.
