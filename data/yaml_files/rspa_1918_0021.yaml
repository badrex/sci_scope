revised_title: The Absorption of Radiation Emitted by a Palladium Anticathode in Rhodium,
  Palladium, and Silver
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the absorption coefficients of the radiation emitted
  by a palladium anticathode in rhodium, palladium, and silver using an X-ray spectrometer.
  The study reveals that the energy in the spectrum is localized in the characteristic
  wavelengths of the metal of the anticathode, with the ratio of the intensity of
  the characteristic rays to the rest of the spectrum being nearly 1:1.
