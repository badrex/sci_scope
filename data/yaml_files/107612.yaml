revised_title: Determination of Pendulum Acceleration in Different Latitudes
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to measure the acceleration of pendulums
  in various latitudes using clocks and pendulums provided by the Royal Society. The
  results were used to deduce information about the Earth's shape and gravity.
