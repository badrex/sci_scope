revised_title: Volumetric Estimation of Sugar by an Ammoniated Cupric Test
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Quantitative Analysis
tldr: The author presents a new volumetric method for estimating sugar using an ammoniated
  cupric test, which allows for greater precision and accuracy in sugar analysis without
  precipitation. The method involves dissolving the reduced copper suboxide in ammonia,
  enabling the point of complete decoloration to be ascertained with precision.
