revised_title: The Choroid Muscle and Its Role in Adapting Eye Focus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author describes a muscle in the choroid coat of the mammalian eye that
  plays a crucial role in adapting the eye's focus for vision at different distances.
  The choroid muscle compresses the vitreous humor, which in turn moves the lens and
  adjusts the eye's focus.
