revised_title: 'Fog Signals: Exploring Areas of Silence and Sound Range'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of areas of silence and sound range in
  fog signals. They explore how wind and temperature gradients affect sound propagation,
  and suggest that these factors can explain the increased audibility of sounds at
  night and over long distances.

- Acoustics
- Fog Signals
- Sound Propagation
