revised_title: The Role of Descending Fluids and Cambium in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: George Rainey investigates the descending fluids of plants, particularly the
  cambium, and provides evidence for the sap's descent through vessels from the leaves
  to the roots. He also explains the role of endosmose in the propulsion of sap and
  the function of the cambium as the nutritious portion of the plant fluids, similar
  to chyle in animals.
