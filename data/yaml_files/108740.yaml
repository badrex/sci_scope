revised_title: On the Equivalence of Double Tangent Equations for Quartic Curves
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebraic Geometry & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates the equivalence of different equations representing
  the double tangents of quartic curves, demonstrating the relationship between Hesse's
  original and transformed forms and Salmon's form. The study involves the use of
  Hessian curves and the application of algebraic transformations.
