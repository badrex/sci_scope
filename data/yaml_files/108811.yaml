scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the structure and formation of nerve-cells in frogs,
  specifically examining apolar, unipolar, and bipolar nerve-cells. Through detailed
  observations and analysis, the author concludes that all nerve-cells have at least
  two fibres connected to them, refuting the existence of apolar and unipolar cells.
