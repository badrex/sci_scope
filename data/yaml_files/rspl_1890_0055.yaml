revised_title: The Influence of Nitrous Acid on Electromotive Force in Metal Cells
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Cells
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of nitrous acid on the electromotive force
  of cells containing specific metals and platinum in nitric acid. They find that
  the electromotive force increases as nitrous acid is produced, and the rate of increase
  depends on factors such as temperature, impurity, and concentration of the acid.
  The results support the idea that nitrous acid plays a significant role in the electromotive
  force of these cells.
