  Observations on the Theory of Fluid Motion'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author examines the challenges in understanding fluid dynamics and resistance,
  discussing the limitations of current theories and the importance of experimental
  evidence. He critiques existing theories by Bernoulli and d'Alembert, and presents
  his own observations on the relationship between fluid velocity and altitude, emphasizing
  the role of orifice size and the need for further experimentation.
