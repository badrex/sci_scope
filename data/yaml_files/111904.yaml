revised_title: 'On the Ureas of Diamines: Structure and Reactions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reactions and properties of ureas derived from diamines,
  focusing on the differences between ethylene-ureas and their isomers. The study
  reveals that these compounds have distinct structures and behaviors under various
  conditions, suggesting that many supposed identical ureas may actually be isomers.
