tldr: 'The author investigates the chemical composition of narcotine and its products
  of decomposition. Two new bases derived from narcotine are prepared: normal narcotine
  (nornarcotine) and dimethyl-normal-narcotine (dimethyl-nor-narcotine). The properties
  and reactions of these bases are compared to other narcotine bases, and neither
  of the new bases has significant physiological effects.'
