scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: The author demonstrates a method for measuring and analyzing curves using mathematical
  principles, specifically focusing on the 11th proposition of Sir Isaac Newton's
  Treatise of Quadratures. The method involves creating a series of curves based on
  the given curve and using mathematical formulas to determine the area and properties
  of these curves.
