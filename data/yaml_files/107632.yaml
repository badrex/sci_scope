revised_title: Comparative Study of the Human and Elephant Membrana Tympani Structure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author compares the structure of the human and elephant membrana tympani,
  revealing significant differences in form and function. The study suggests that
  the varying lengths of the fibres in the elephant's membrane make it less adaptable
  to musical sounds compared to the human ear.
