tldr: This study examines the effects of galvanic currents on the excitability of
  sensory nerves in humans. The researchers found that the alterations in excitability
  follow a similar course to those observed in motor nerves, with the anodic and cathodic
  influences affecting the sensory nerves' response to stimuli.
