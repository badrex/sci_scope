scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Analysis & Inference
tldr: The author investigates the sign of association in contingency tables for inherited
  qualities and demonstrates that the distribution remains isotropic even when the
  tables are grouped or regrouped. This method can be used to determine the order
  of variables in tables based on anthropometric measurements.

- Contingency Tables
- Isotropy
