revised_title: The Germicidal Action and Practical Applications of Chloramines
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Chemical Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the germicidal properties of chloramines and their potential
  as antiseptics. They find that chloramines have a higher germicidal action than
  hypochlorites and are not protein coagulants, making them suitable for practical
  use. Toluene sodium sulphochloramide, in particular, shows promise as a valuable
  antiseptic.
