revised_title: Influence of Metals and Metalloids on the Electrical Conductivity of
  Copper
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of various metals and metalloids on the electrical
  conductivity of copper. They find that the presence of impurities, such as phosphorus
  and lead, significantly reduces the conductivity of copper, while the addition of
  small amounts of other metals like zinc and tin has a lesser effect. The study emphasizes
  the importance of using pure copper for electrical applications.
