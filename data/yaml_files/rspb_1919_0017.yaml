revised_title: The Ineffectiveness of Atropine on the Emotive Response
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Psychology
tldr: This study investigates the effect of atropine on the emotive response and the
  psycho-galvanic reflex. The author, Rita Markbreiter, conducted a series of experiments
  using atropine injections on herself and other subjects, but found no significant
  difference in the emotive response between atropinized and non-atropinized hands.
  The results suggest that atropine may not have an effect on the emotive response,
  and further research is needed to determine the reasons for the discrepancy between
  these findings and previous studies.
