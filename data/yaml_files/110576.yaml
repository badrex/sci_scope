revised_title: Equilibrium of Homogeneous Ellipsoids in a Centrifugal Force
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Planetary Sciences
tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium of ellipsoids and spheroids in a centrifugal
  force, determining the conditions and properties necessary for equilibrium. The
  study includes the effects of varying axes and the ratio of the centrifugal to attractive
  forces, with implications for planetary figures and the geometry of celestial bodies.
