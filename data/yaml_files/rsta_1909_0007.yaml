scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Probability
tldr: The author investigates a probability question related to elections by ballot
  and uses lattice structures to analyze permutations, combinations, and partitions
  of numbers. The study provides a method to determine the probability that a candidate
  never has fewer votes than the unsuccessful one during the ballot process.
