revised_title: Investigation of Acoustical Figures and Vibrating Elastic Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Acoustics
tldr: Faraday investigates the behavior of powders on vibrating surfaces and explains
  the formation of nodal lines and patterns through the creation of vortices in the
  surrounding medium. He demonstrates that these phenomena occur in various conditions,
  including air and water, and provides a detailed explanation of the underlying mechanisms.
