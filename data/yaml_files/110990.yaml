revised_title: Influence of Magnetism on Polarized Light and Diamagnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetism
tldr: Carlo Matteucci investigates the influence of magnetism on polarized light and
  diamagnetism. He discovers that the rotation produced by a magnet on compressed
  heavy glass is not the same in both directions and that the rotation is greater
  in the direction of the rotation produced by compression. He also finds that compressed
  flint-glass does not exhibit any noticeable rotation under the influence of a magnet,
  and that the action of diamagnetic bodies on each other and on gaseous bodies is
  either weak or non-existent.
