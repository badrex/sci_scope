revised_title: Experiments on the Cooling of Water Below Its Freezing Point and the
  Effect of Substances on Freezing
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the cooling of water below its freezing point and the
  effect of various substances on freezing. The experiments reveal that water's ability
  to resist freezing is influenced by transparency, the presence of air, and chemical
  mixtures, with acids generally improving this quality.
