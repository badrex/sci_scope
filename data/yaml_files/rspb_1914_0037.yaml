scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the susceptibility of various animals to the Zululand
  strain of Trypanosoma brucei and compare it to the Nyasaland strain. They find that
  the Zululand strain has less impact on goats and cattle, while monkeys, dogs, rabbits,
  and guinea pigs are more susceptible to the disease. The study provides insights
  into the transmission and impact of the trypanosome causing disease in animals and
  humans.
