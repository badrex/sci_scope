revised_title: Investigation of the Thermal Expansion of Metals and Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the thermal expansion of various metals and alloys,
  including copper, by measuring their expansion in water at different temperatures.
  The results show that the expansion of copper can be accurately calculated using
  a specific formula, while other metals and alloys exhibit varying degrees of expansion
  based on their composition.
