revised_title: A Study of a Conjugating Yeast and its Reproductive Methods
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Cell Biology
tldr: The author investigates a unique conjugating yeast, observing its growth patterns,
  cellular reproduction methods, and spore formation. The yeast is found to be a high-temperature
  form, with optimal growth occurring at 25-30Â°C. The organism reproduces through
  vegetative propagation by budding and the formation of spores, with spore-containing
  cells consisting of two cells joined together by a neck.
