revised_title: Forbes' Observations on Glacier Ice Plasticity and Viscous Theory
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Geophysics
tldr: Forbes examines De Saussure's rigid ice theory and proposes a plasticity-based
  explanation for glacier motion. He conducts experiments in the Mer de Glace, measuring
  the relative motion of different parts of the glacier and confirming the role of
  plasticity in its movement.
