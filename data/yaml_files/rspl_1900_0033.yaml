scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author discovers a new fossil plant genus, Lepidocarpon, which has seed-like
  fructifications that were borne on strobili indistinguishable from Lepidostrobus.
  This finding challenges the traditional boundary between Sporophyta and Archegoniophyta
  and provides insight into the reproductive structures of ancient Lycopods.
