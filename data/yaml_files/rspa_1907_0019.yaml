revised_title: Investigating the Presence of Europium in Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The authors analyze the spectra of several stars, including a Bootis and ft
  Geminorum, and find that the presence of europium lines in these stars' spectra
  is stronger than in the solar spectrum. They also observe that the discordance in
  radial velocity deduced from the calcium line varies with different types of stars.
