tldr: The author conducts experiments on the vagus and spinal accessory nerves to
  determine their functions and the origin of their motor fibers. The results suggest
  that the majority of motor fibers in the vagus nerve come from the spinal accessory,
  controlling the movement of the larynx, heart, and stomach. The study also indicates
  that the motor fibers distributed to the heart and stomach are primarily nucleated
  or 'Remak' fibers.
