tldr: The Astronomer Royal, Sir George Biddell Airy, conducts magnetic observations
  in the Britannia and Conway tubular iron bridges. The study examines the effects
  of disturbed magnetic azimuth, disturbed time of vibration of a horizontal needle,
  and disturbed dip. The results show that the transversal and vertical parts of terrestrial
  magnetism are neutralized, and the terrestrial longitudinal force is diminished
  by about one fourth part.
