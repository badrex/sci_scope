revised_title: Molecular Influences on Heat Transmission in Organic Structures
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geology
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the molecular structure of wood and its influence
  on heat transmission. He develops a new instrument to measure the conductivity of
  various types of wood and establishes that wood has three unequal axes of calorific
  conduction. These findings have implications for understanding the properties of
  other organic structures and their potential impact on climate.
