tldr: This study investigates the changes in electrical conductivity in plant roots
  under geotropic stimulation. The researchers found that turning the root horizontal
  caused an immediate decrease in resistance, indicating an increase in permeability
  to ions. The results suggest that the proximate mechanism of geotropic response
  in plants is a change in the permeability of the protoplasm in the cells of the
  perceptive region.
