tldr: James Anderson investigates the peculiarities of tides between Fairleigh and
  North Foreland and explains the supposed meeting of tides near Dungeness. He describes
  the channel's contraction and the resistance the western tide faces at Dungeness
  and Cape D'Alpree. Anderson attributes the rise and fall of tides at adjacent places
  to the accumulation of water in these basins and concludes that the tides do not
  meet violently at Dungeness.
