revised_title: The Role of Central Origin in Rhythmic Activity of the Nervous System
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the factors in rhythmic activity of the nervous system,
  focusing on the central origin of rhythm in muscle reflexes. The author examines
  the responses to simple and compounded stimuli in both low spinal and decerebrate
  preparations, discovering that rhythmic reactions are more common in the latter.
  The findings suggest that rhythmic responses may be a result of a balance between
  equal and opposite states of excitation and inhibition in the nervous system.
