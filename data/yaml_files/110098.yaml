scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurochemistry
tldr: Sir Everard Home investigates the similarities between brain materials and animal
  ova through microscopical observations and freezing experiments. He finds that the
  molecular structure of both is altered during freezing, and that testicular secretion
  does not contain animalcules as previously believed.
