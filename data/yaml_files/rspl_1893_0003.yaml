revised_title: Investigating the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat and Electrical Units
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanical equivalent of heat and the relationship
  between electrical and mechanical units through a series of experiments. They develop
  a calorimeter and a pressure regulator to control variables and obtain accurate
  results, ultimately confirming Newton's law of cooling and establishing a connection
  between the mechanical equivalent of heat and electrical units.

- Calorimetry
- Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
