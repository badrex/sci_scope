revised_title: Improving Astronomical Clocks with a New Escapement and Pendulum Governor
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Timekeeping
tldr: Sir William Thomson proposes a new escapement mechanism and pendulum governor
  for astronomical clocks to improve their timekeeping accuracy. The new design reduces
  the interval of rest for the escapement, leading to more precise and uniform motion.
