revised_title: The Electromotive Properties of the Skin of the Common Eel
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the common eel's skin
  and demonstrates that the current of rest is more likely associated with active
  secretory processes in the glandular elements rather than a demarcation surface.
  The study also shows that both negative and positive variations of the current of
  rest can be elicited through experimental treatment of the removed skin.
