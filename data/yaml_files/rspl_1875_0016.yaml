scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: The author examines the locomotor system of medusae, specifically the movements
  and responses of their nectocalyx and gonocalyx, and their sensitivity to electrical
  stimulation. The study reveals differences in the degree of paralysis and sensitivity
  among various species of medusae.
topics:
- Medusae Locomotion
- Nectocalyx Paralysis
- Gonocalyx Excision
- Electrical Stimulation
- Medusae Sensitivity
