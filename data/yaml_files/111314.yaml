scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the velocities of air currents in vertical tubes due
  to the presence of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere. The study demonstrates a correspondence
  between the variations of force in upward air currents and variations in atmospheric
  humidity, suggesting that these variations are largely due to changing hygrometric
  conditions.
