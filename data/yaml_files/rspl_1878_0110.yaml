scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Photobiology
tldr: John Tyndall investigates the effect of light on the growth of organisms in
  sealed flasks containing organic infusions. He finds that exposure to sunlight accelerates
  the growth of organisms in the flasks, even when the flasks are initially sterilized.
  This study highlights the importance of light in the growth and development of microorganisms.
