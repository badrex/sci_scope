tldr: In 1740, Dr. Bevis and Mr. James Short observed the occultation of Jupiter and
  his satellites by the Moon. They used reflecting telescopes to record the times
  and events during the occultation. The observation revealed that Jupiter's light
  appeared dimmer and fainter in comparison to the Moon's during the event, and the
  satellites' eclipses were recorded. The researchers also noted that the Moon's surface
  appeared rugged and uneven when observed through a telescope.
