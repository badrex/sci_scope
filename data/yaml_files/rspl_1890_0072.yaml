revised_title: A Reassessment of the Theory of Thin Elastic Shells
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author revisits the theory of thin elastic shells, specifically addressing
  the limitations of previous theories and proposing a new method of approximation.
  The new approach considers the extension of the middle surface and takes into account
  the potential energy due to both extension and bending, leading to a more accurate
  understanding of the vibrations and deformation of thin shells.
