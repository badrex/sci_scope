revised_title: Displacements and Paths of Particles in Two-Dimensional Motion of Frictionless
  Liquid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the paths of individual particles in various cases of
  two-dimensional motion of frictionless liquid, including rotating elliptic cylinders,
  equilateral triangular prisms, and plane laminas. The study reveals the deformation
  of volume elements and limitations of the continuum concept in hydrodynamics.
