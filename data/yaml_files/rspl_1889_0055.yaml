revised_title: Investigating the Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances through
  Sea-Water Caused by Explosions
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: The authors conduct a series of experiments to study the velocity of transmission
  of disturbances through sea-water caused by explosions. They use various types of
  explosives, including guncotton, dynamite, and diazobenzene nitrate, and measure
  the velocity of the disturbances using pendulum chronographs. The results provide
  insights into the behavior of underwater explosions and their potential applications
  in torpedo technology.
