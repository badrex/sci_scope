revised_title: The Oxidation of Phenol by Certain Bacteria in Pure Culture
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The authors investigate the ability of specific bacteria to oxidize phenol in
  pure culture and find that the chromogenic organism is highly effective in breaking
  down phenol, while Bacillus liquefaciens fluorescens does not show significant activity.
  The study highlights the potential role of these bacteria in the biodegradation
  of phenolic compounds in the environment.
