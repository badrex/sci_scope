revised_title: Observations on Fungal Seeds and Propagation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author discusses the seeds and propagation methods of various fungal species,
  particularly mushrooms, and challenges the notion that the seeds mentioned in previous
  works are the true seeds of these plants. He argues that the so-called seeds are
  actually suckers or stolones, and that the true seeds are produced sparingly or
  are difficult to save.
