revised_title: An Improved Thermometer for Measuring Extreme Heat and Cold
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author invents an improved thermometer that can accurately measure the highest
  and lowest temperatures in an observer's absence. The device features two separate
  mercury columns, one on each side of the glass tube, which react to changes in heat
  and cold. The thermometer's index displays the highest and lowest temperatures reached
  during the day and night, allowing for more precise temperature tracking.
