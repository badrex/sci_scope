revised_title: 'Decomposition of Nitrotoluylic Acid: New Organic Acids and Ureas'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of nitrotoluylic acid and discovers
  new organic acids and ureas. He describes the preparation and properties of nitrotoluylamide
  and its reaction with reducing agents. The study of its properties leads to the
  identification of a new acid, which may be an analogue of carbanilic acid or anthranilic
  acid, opening up possibilities for new substances related to salicylic acid and
  its derivatives.
