scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Ichthyology
tldr: The author examines the microscopic structure of bones in various types of osseous
  fishes, discovering that many genera lack bone-corpuscles and real osseous tissue,
  which has implications for systematic zoology and the identification of fossil remains.
