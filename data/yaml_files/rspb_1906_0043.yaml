  Division'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The authors investigate the synapsis in amphibia, specifically focusing on the
  prophase of the first maiotic division in Triton. They observe chromatic structures,
  or Anlagen, in the nuclei of resting premaiotic cells, which pair up during the
  synaptic change. These paired structures, or gemini, are a key aspect of the maiotic
  process and provide evidence for the permanence of chromosomes from one cell generation
  to another.
