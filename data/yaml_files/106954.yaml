revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Metals and Moisture on Muscular Contractions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the influence of metals and moisture on muscular contractions
  in relation to Galvani's experiments. The study finds that the interaction between
  metals and moisture is sufficient to cause muscle contractions, suggesting that
  animals contribute to this phenomenon through their moisture alone.
