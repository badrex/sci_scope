revised_title: Effects of Intracranial Pressure on Circulation and Respiration
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Neuroscience
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of increased intracranial pressure on circulation
  and respiration. They find that the pressure influences these processes through
  the diminution of the medulla's physiological activity and demonstrate a sequence
  of changes based on the degree of impairment.
