scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Cartography
tldr: The author examines the site and origin of Graham Island, debunking the myth
  of a shoal with four fathoms of water as its nucleus. Through rigorous investigation
  and analysis, the author concludes that the island's existence is not related to
  the alleged shoal and that the assertion of its formation by the lifting up of such
  a shoal is unfounded.
