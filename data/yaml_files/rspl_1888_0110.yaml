revised_title: The Relative Amounts of Voltaic Energy in Dissolved Chemical Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Methods
tldr: The author measures the relative voltaic energy of nearly 250 aqueous solutions
  of dissolved chemical compounds using the 'voltaic balance' method. The results
  support the conclusion that every electrolytic substance or mixture can unite chemically
  in indefinite proportions with other dissolved substances, provided no separation
  occurs.
