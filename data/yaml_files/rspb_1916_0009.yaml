scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Sciences
tldr: The authors investigate the fossilized remains of Characean plants found in
  Purbeck beds and discover a new genus, Clavator, with distinct characteristics such
  as club-like nodes and clusters of small clavate processes. They also find that
  the fossilized plants have a complex structure, with a single thick-walled tube
  surrounded by twelve equal contiguous sheathing tubes.
