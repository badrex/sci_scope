revised_title: New Determination of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule presents new experiments to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat,
  specifically through the thermal effects of water friction. The result is that the
  mechanical equivalent of heat, reduced to sea-level at Greenwich, is 772.55 foot-pounds.
