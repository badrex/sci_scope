tldr: The author presents a new method for finding the equations of caustics, which
  involves differentiating the polar equation of a reflected ray and eliminating arbitrary
  quantities to obtain the curve's equation. This method is simpler, more elegant,
  and more general than previous methods, and it can also be applied to solving other
  problems in geometry and optics.
