revised_title: The Intensity and Direction of the Force of Gravity in India
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author investigates the intensity and direction of gravity in India using
  pendulum observations and finds a general deficiency of matter in the Earth's crust
  throughout the country. The study also reveals significant deficiencies of matter
  beneath certain stations, suggesting that the Himalayan mountains may be decreasing
  the density of the surrounding plains.
