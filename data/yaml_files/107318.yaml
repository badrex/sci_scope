scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Comets
tldr: The author, William Herschel, observes a second comet and compares its physical
  construction to that of the first comet. He finds that the second comet has a larger
  nucleus and a fainter chevelure, suggesting a planetary condition. The author also
  discusses the transparency and elasticity of the comet's atmosphere and the possible
  presence of phosphoric matter in the tail.
