scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: This study investigates the structure and morphology of the leaves and inflorescences
  of Welwitschia Mirabilis, an xerophytic plant. The research focuses on the adaptations
  of the plant to its arid environment, including the unique features of its leaves,
  such as the bilayered epidermis, deeply sunk stomata, and the presence of calcium
  oxalate crystals. The vascular system and the branching patterns of the inflorescences
  are also examined.
