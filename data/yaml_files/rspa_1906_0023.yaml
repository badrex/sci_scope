revised_title: Electric Resistance to the Motion of a Charged Conducting Sphere in
  Free Space or in a Field of Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a charged conducting sphere in a uniform
  electric field and finds that the electric force contributes to the inertia in the
  equation of motion. The medium's damping action ceases once a surface density independent
  of time is established, and the electric field in the vicinity of the sphere becomes
  constant.
