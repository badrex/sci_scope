  from Australia

scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines additional fossil remains of the gigantic land-lizard (Megalania
  prisca) from Australia, focusing on the tail's armor and skeletal structure. The
  findings suggest that the animal had a complex and robust tail armor, which may
  have been used for both offense and defense. The author also compares the tail armor
  to that of a small Uromastix lizard, highlighting similarities in the annular arrangement
  of the horns.
