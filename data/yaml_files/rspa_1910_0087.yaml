tldr: The British Antarctic Expedition of 1907 conducted tidal observations using
  a modified tide gauge. The observations revealed oscillations of shorter intervals
  than tidal periods, which the researchers believe to be seiches. The study also
  recorded a higher tidal range than expected, with a difference of up to 6 feet.
