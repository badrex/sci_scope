tldr: Sir Robert Seppings proposes a new method for constructing ships in the Mercantile
  Navy, using shorter lengths of timber, less curvature, and connecting them with
  dowels instead of wedge pieces. This method provides better support and strength,
  especially in the event of grounding, and can utilize smaller timber for frames,
  previously considered suitable only for frigates.
