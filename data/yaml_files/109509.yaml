revised_title: Explaining Double Images Caused by Atmospherical Refraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the causes of double and triple images of objects due
  to atmospheric refraction. He explains these phenomena using theoretical principles
  and demonstrates them through experiments with fluids of varying densities. The
  author also discusses the role of temperature differences and heat sources in producing
  these effects.
