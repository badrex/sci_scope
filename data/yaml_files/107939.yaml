tldr: The author explores the properties and applications of elliptic transcendents,
  including their transformation and multiplication, and their use in geometry and
  mechanics. The text covers the work of various mathematicians, such as Euler, Landen,
  Lagrange, Legendre, Abel, and Jacobi, who contributed to the development of this
  branch of analysis.
