revised_title: A Simple Method for Finding the Approximate Period of Stable Systems
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a simple method to find the approximate period of stable
  systems, such as structures or ships, by considering them as equivalent pendulums.
  This method allows engineers to determine the stiffness and deflections for a given
  load, even when mathematical calculations are difficult or impossible.
