revised_title: The Oxidizing Action of Radium Bromide Rays and Their Decomposition
  of Iodoform
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Radiochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the oxidizing action of rays emitted by radium bromide
  and their effect on the decomposition of iodoform. They find that the rays penetrate
  various materials and are most likely due to beta and gamma rays. The study demonstrates
  that the rays have a different nature than light rays and that sunlight's active
  rays are not the same as those from radium.
