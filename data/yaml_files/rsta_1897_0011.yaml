revised_title: Condensation of Water Vapour in Dust-Free Air and Other Gases
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of air saturated with aqueous vapor when
  expanded suddenly, focusing on the role of dust-free air and other gases in condensation.
  The study aims to determine the limit of supersaturation that can be attained without
  condensation taking place throughout the moist air, with implications for meteorological
  and physical understanding.
