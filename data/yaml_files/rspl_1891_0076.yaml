revised_title: On the Formation of Glassy and Crystalline Structures in Igneous Rocks
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Petrology
tldr: The author examines the formation of glassy and crystalline structures in igneous
  rocks, suggesting that water plays a significant role in the process. The presence
  of water in magma may explain the rarity of tachylites and the elongated shapes
  of crystallites.
