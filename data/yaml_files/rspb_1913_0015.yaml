scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of adrenalin on veins, finding that it causes
  contraction in both veins near and far from the heart. The research also suggests
  that adrenalin may play a role in the rhythmicity of the heart, supporting the myogenic
  hypothesis.
