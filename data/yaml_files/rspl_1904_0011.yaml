  Tumor'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The authors investigate the cell proliferation and conjugation of resting nuclei
  in an epithelioma of a mouse. They observe that the tumor growth is a phenomenon
  unparalleled in mammalia and study the growth of tumors at successive stages of
  24 hours, finding conjugation of resting nuclei in a tumor removed on the eighth
  day.
