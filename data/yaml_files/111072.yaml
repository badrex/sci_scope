scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Anatomy
tldr: Richard Owen's study on the communications between the tympanum and palate in
  crocodilian reptiles reveals a distinct system of Eustachian canals, which are unique
  to this group of reptiles. The research also clarifies the position of the carotid
  foramina and posterior nostrils in Teleosauri and other extinct crocodilians.
