revised_title: Investigating the Limiting Thickness of Liquid Films
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors develop a modified apparatus to study the limiting thickness of
  liquid films, specifically soap films, and find that the mean thickness of black
  films is nearly the same for both soap solution and Plateau's 'liquid glycerique.'
  They also discover that the mean values of thickness are the same, within a fraction
  of a millionth of a millimeter, whether the films are plane or cylindrical, in contact
  with metal or glass, and formed of soap solution alone or with the addition of glycerine.
