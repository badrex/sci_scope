  Examination'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate motor localisation in the gibbon's brain through a series
  of experiments and histological examination. They find that the gibbon's remarkable
  use of its arms and hands correlates with an expanded cortex in the precentral region,
  and they confirm their deductions through cortical stimulation and analysis.
