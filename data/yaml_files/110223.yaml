scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author, Fearon Fallows, describes his observations made with the Invariable
  Pendulum at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, to determine the compression
  of the Earth. He discusses the advantages of using the pendulum method and provides
  a detailed account of his experimental setup and findings, which indicate a compression
  of 2.T.
