revised_title: On Electrotorsion and its Effects on Iron Wires
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of electrotorsion, discovering that it
  causes torsional movements in iron wires accompanied by audible sounds. The study
  explores the effects of various materials and currents, concluding that the most
  probable cause of the torsion is the combined influence of longitudinal magnetic
  polarity and induced magnetism at a right angle to it, causing molecular motion
  and change in particle position.
