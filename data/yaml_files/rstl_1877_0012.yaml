scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author expands on Professor Casey's theory of the bicircular quartic, providing
  further developments in the analytical and geometrical aspects of the curve. The
  article establishes monomial equations and relations between parameters for inscribed
  quadrilaterals, and explores the transformation to elliptic integrals.
