scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: Dr. Schlaffle's research investigates the distribution of surface species in
  cubic surfaces of the third order, focusing on the presence or absence of singular
  points and the reality of their lines. The study categorizes various forms of singular
  surfaces and discusses their equations and properties.
