tldr: The author discusses the discovery of an extinct genus of sturgeon, Chondrosteus,
  found in the Lias Formation at Lyme Regis. The study of this genus and its anatomical
  characteristics confirms its classification within the Sturionidae family, despite
  differences from modern sturgeons. The article provides a detailed description of
  the specimens, their preservation, and the unique anatomical features of Chondrosteus,
  such as its shorter and more bulky body, and the arrangement and size of its fins.
