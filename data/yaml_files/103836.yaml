tldr: This letter from Evan Davis describes the outcomes of smallpox inoculation in
  children in Haverford-West, Pembrokeshire. In some cases, the children developed
  measles before the smallpox, which delayed the onset of the smallpox symptoms. The
  letter also discusses the success of inoculation in preventing severe cases of smallpox
  and the potential benefits of using this method as a protective measure against
  the disease.
