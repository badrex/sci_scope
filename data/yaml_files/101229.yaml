revised_title: 'Examining the Loadstone and its Variations: A Review of Gilbert''s
  Circumvolution Theory'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author examines Gilbert's circumvolution theory and the variation of the
  loadstone's declination. Through experiments with spherical magnets and needles,
  the author finds that the loadstone's declination varies and that Gilbert's theory
  is insufficient to explain the phenomenon. The author also discusses the possibility
  of a perpetual motion without wheels and the potential impact of the loadstone's
  properties on the Earth's rotation.
