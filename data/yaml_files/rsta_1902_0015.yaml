revised_title: A Study of a Throw-Testing Machine for Reversals of Mean Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors develop a throw-testing machine to investigate the effects of repeated
  stress on materials, particularly focusing on the relationship between the range
  of stress and the number of reversals before rupture. They find that under a given
  range of stress, the number of reversals decreases as the frequency increases, and
  that hard steels cannot sustain as many reversals as mild steels at high frequencies.
