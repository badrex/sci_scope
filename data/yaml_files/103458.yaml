tldr: In a letter to his brother, Arthur Dobbs describes his observations of the Aurora
  Borealis in Ireland in September 1725. He provides detailed accounts of the various
  appearances and behaviors of the phenomenon, including the colors, shapes, and movements
  of the light. Dobbs also offers a hypothesis on the nature of the Aurora Borealis,
  suggesting it is a result of nitro-sulphureous vapors in the atmosphere.
