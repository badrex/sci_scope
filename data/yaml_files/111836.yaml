revised_title: Scheutz's Calculating Machine and Babbage's Difference Engine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Computing & Information Technology
tldr: The report examines M. Scheutz's calculating machine, a Difference Engine, and
  compares it to Charles Babbage's Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. The Scheutz
  engine follows Babbage's ideas but has a different mechanism for performing calculations
  and printing results. The machine can tabulate functions with constant fourth differences,
  and its utility depends on its ability to handle general functions.
