  and Surface Phenomena'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: This article investigates the interior structure of the Earth and its surface
  phenomena, focusing on the pressures at the surface of contact between the Earth's
  nucleus and shell, the variation of gravity, density laws, and the potential existence
  of a solid nucleus. The author also discusses the effects of pressures on the shell's
  fissures and the existence of a zone of least disturbance.
