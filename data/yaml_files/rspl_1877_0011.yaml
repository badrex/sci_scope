revised_title: 'Transformation of Leucoline into Aniline: A Study in the Chinoline
  Series'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the transformation of leucoline into aniline, focusing
  on the chinoline series. The author describes the oxidation process and the resulting
  acid, leucolinic acid, which can be transformed into aniline through further reactions
  with soda-lime. The research provides insights into the chemistry of nitrogen heterocycles
  and the synthesis of aniline.
