revised_title: Investigating Electrical Currents in Living Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if electrical currents are present
  during the secretion process in living animals. Using various electrodes and animal
  subjects, the author finds that electrical currents do exist, particularly in the
  stomach and liver, suggesting a connection between these organs and the presence
  of bioelectricity.
