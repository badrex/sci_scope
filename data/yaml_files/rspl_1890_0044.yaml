revised_title: Investigating the Germination Process of Castor-oil Plant Seeds
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines the germination process of castor-oil plant seeds, focusing
  on the role of oil reserves and the transformation of fatty matter. The study aims
  to understand how reserve materials are made available for the embryo's nutrition
  and the process of absorption, as well as the roles of the endosperm and embryo
  in germination.
