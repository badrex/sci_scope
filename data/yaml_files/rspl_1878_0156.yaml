revised_title: In-depth Study of Metallic Vapour Line Reversal
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the reversal of lines in metallic vapours using various
  crucibles and electric arcs. They observe that the introduction of a current of
  hydrogen or coal-gas into the crucibles can significantly affect the appearance
  of the lines, with some disappearing entirely. The study provides valuable insights
  into the properties of metallic vapours and their interactions with different materials.
