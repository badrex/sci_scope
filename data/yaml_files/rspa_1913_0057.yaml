revised_title: 'Rays of Positive Electricity: Their Properties and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the properties of positive rays, which are composed
  of various types of particles with different masses and charges. By using electric
  and magnetic fields, the author is able to sort and analyze these particles, determining
  their velocities and characteristics. The study of these rays contributes to the
  understanding of the nature of matter and the behavior of particles in electric
  and magnetic fields.
topics:
- Electricity
- Magnetic Fields
- Cathode Rays
- Particle Acceleration
- Particle Detection
