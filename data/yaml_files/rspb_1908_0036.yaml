revised_title: Investigating the Ultra-Microscopical Stage of Trypanosomes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Parasitology
tldr: The authors investigate whether trypanosomes have an ultra-microscopical stage
  in their life cycle, which could potentially pass through filters and cause diseases
  like nagana. They conduct several experiments using blood and organs from infected
  animals, but find no evidence of ultra-microscopical forms of the trypanosomes.
