revised_title: Investigating the Boundary Conditions of Turbulent Fluid Motion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the boundary conditions of turbulent fluid motion by
  measuring the velocity of the fluid near the wall using a fine Pitot tube. They
  find that the radial distribution of velocity varies with the frictional resistance,
  suggesting that the flow is not entirely laminar near the wall.
