revised_title: Further Observations on the Ascending of Drops of Spirit of Wine between
  Two Glass Planes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author presents further experiments on the movement of drops of spirit of
  wine between two glass planes and provides a table of distances and angles of elevation.
  The results show that the behavior of the drops is consistent with previous observations,
  demonstrating the influence of surface tension and capillary action.
topics:
- Capillary action
- Surface tension
- Fluid dynamics
- Experimental physics
- Measurement techniques
