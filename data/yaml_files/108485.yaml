revised_title: Marsupial Dental Tissues and Enamel Structure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author examines the dental tissues of marsupial animals, focusing on the
  unique structure of their enamel. He discovers that the dentinal tubes extend into
  the enamel, forming a significant portion of its composition. This finding distinguishes
  marsupial teeth from those of other mammals and provides insight into their dental
  development.
