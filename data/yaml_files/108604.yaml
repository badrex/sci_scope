revised_title: The Figure, Dimensions, and Mean Specific Gravity of the Earth from
  the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Surveying
tldr: The author discusses the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain and Ireland,
  detailing the methods used to create a consistent triangulation and the measurements
  of the Earth's figure, dimensions, and mean specific gravity. The study provides
  a more accurate understanding of the Earth's shape and density, contributing to
  the field of geodesy and surveying.
