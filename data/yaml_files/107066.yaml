revised_title: Observations on the Quantity of Horizontal Refraction and a Method
  for Measuring the Dip at Sea
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between temperature, atmospheric conditions,
  and horizontal refraction over water. They observe that the quantity of refraction
  is influenced by the difference in temperature between the water and air, as well
  as the dryness of the atmosphere. The author also presents a method for measuring
  the dip at sea.
topics:
- Atmospheric Refraction
- Temperature and Refraction
- Hygrometer
- Horizontal Refraction
