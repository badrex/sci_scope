revised_title: 'Spectra of Planetary Nebulae: A Study of Light Refrangibility and
  Composition'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author investigates the spectra of various planetary nebulae and discovers
  that their light is composed of three distinct bright lines and a faint continuous
  spectrum. The bright lines are found to be nitrogen, hydrogen, and a third unidentified
  element, while the faint spectrum is believed to be produced by the solid or liquid
  matter in the nucleus of the nebulae. The study provides insights into the composition
  and nature of planetary nebulae, which are distinct from stars and other celestial
  objects.
