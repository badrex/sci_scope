  Circuit
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Circuits
tldr: Charles Wheatstone describes various instruments and processes for determining
  the constants of a voltaic circuit, including the use of a rheostat and a galvanometer.
  He also discusses the principles of Ohm's theory and the electromotive forces and
  resistances in a circuit.
topics:
- Electricity
- Ohm's Law
- Voltameter
- Rheostat
- Galvanometer
