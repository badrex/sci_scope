revised_title: The Electro-Chemical Preservation of Metals in Marine Environments
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Corrosion
tldr: Humphry Davy investigates the use of electro-chemical methods to prevent metal
  corrosion in marine environments, specifically focusing on copper sheathing in ships.
  He explores the effectiveness of various metals, such as iron and zinc, in forming
  insoluble compounds on the surface, which protect the underlying metal from corrosion
  and adhesion of weeds and shellfish.
