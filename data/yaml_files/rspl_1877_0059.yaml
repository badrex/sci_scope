revised_title: Investigating the Optical Properties of Doubly Refracting Crystals
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Crystallography
tldr: The author explores the optical properties of doubly refracting crystals and
  develops a method to determine the index of refraction of minerals using a microscope
  with a graduated scale and vernier. The study reveals unique phenomena and challenges
  in measuring the index of refraction in different mineral structures.
