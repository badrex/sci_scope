  and Common Steel'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author, Sir Thomas Frankland, describes a simple process for welding cast
  steel, iron, and common steel. He explains that cast steel can be united with iron
  in a white heat, and provides a detailed account of the process and materials used.
  This discovery challenges the common belief that cast steel cannot be welded to
  common steel or iron.
