revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Gangetic Alluvium on the Plumb-Line in
  Northern India

scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the deflections of the plumb-line near the southern edge
  of the Himalayas and investigates the effect of the Gangetic alluvium on these deflections.
  The study reveals a large residual northerly deflection near the main boundary of
  the Himalayas, which decreases rapidly in a short distance on either side and disappears
  at about 20 to 30 miles southwards. The author proposes an alternative explanation
  for these findings, based on geological observations and the structure of the region.
