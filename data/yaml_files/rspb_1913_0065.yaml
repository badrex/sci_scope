revised_title: The Formation and Characteristics of Anthocyan Pigments in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the formation and properties of anthocyan pigments in
  plants, focusing on the role of glucosides and their relationship with xanthein
  pigments. The authors explore the various factors that influence pigment formation,
  including genetic factors, enzyme action, and the presence of inhibitors. They also
  discuss the significance of striping and streaking patterns in flowers, which they
  attribute to local inhibition of oxydase or a lack of chromogen.
