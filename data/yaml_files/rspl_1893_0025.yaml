revised_title: The Potential and Stability of Anchor Rings and Vortex Rings
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the potential and stability of anchor rings and vortex
  rings, determining the potential at internal points and analyzing the stability
  of annular fluid under various disturbances. The study also includes the potential
  of a ring of elliptic cross-section and the motion of multiple vortex rings on the
  same axis.
