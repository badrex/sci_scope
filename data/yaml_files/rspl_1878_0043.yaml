revised_title: On the Specific Inductive Capacities of Certain Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the specific inductive capacities
  of various dielectrics using electrified metal plates and discuss the results obtained,
  which are lower than previous experimental values. They suggest that the specific
  inductive capacity of dielectrics may increase during the first fraction of a second
  after the commencement of electrification.
