revised_title: Exploring the Chemical Principles of Poisonous Substances and Their
  Effects on the Nervous System
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical properties of poisons and their relation
  to the animal organism, focusing on their effects on the nervous system. The study
  suggests that nitrogen-containing substances with chemical tension, such as nitroglycerine,
  have a significant impact on nerve-force evolution and can cause paralysis by disrupting
  the balance of chemical affinities in the nervous structures.
