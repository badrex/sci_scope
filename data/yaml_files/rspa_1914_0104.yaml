revised_title: 'Quantitative Measurements of the Absorption of Light: The Molecular
  Extinctions of Saturated Aliphatic Ketones'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the absorption of light by saturated aliphatic ketones
  and finds that the molecular vibration theory is unsound. The electromagnetic force
  field theory is supported by experimental results, which show that the absorption
  lies in the electromagnetic field surrounding the molecule as a whole.
