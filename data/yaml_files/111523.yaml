scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the functions of visceral nerves and the inhibitory
  system, discovering that mild stimulation of these nerves can cause increased action
  in the heart and intestines. The study also reveals that the inhibitory influence
  is sometimes exerted in natural animal actions, suggesting its role in regulating
  bodily functions.
