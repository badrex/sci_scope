revised_title: Experiments and Observations on a New Apparatus for Exhibiting Perpetual
  Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanics
tldr: The author investigates a new apparatus called a'machine for exhibiting perpetual
  electricity' and discovers that it produces negative and positive electric phenomena.
  The experiments demonstrate the differences in behavior between the new apparatus
  and a Leyden jar, and the author discusses the implications of these findings for
  understanding electricity.
