revised_title: Photographic Analysis of Stellar Spectra and Planetary Modifications
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Stellar Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines the photographic spectra of stars and planets using a specialized
  telescope and apparatus. The study reveals that the spectra of white stars exhibit
  a unique pattern of lines, while the spectra of planets show no significant modifications
  in the violet and ultra-violet regions. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of stellar and planetary compositions.
