tldr: Arnold Marcel, nephew of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, shares his discovery of a
  method to magnetize iron and steel without the use of loadstones. He details his
  experiments and findings, including the creation of artificial loadstones and the
  effects of rubbing techniques on the magnetization process.
