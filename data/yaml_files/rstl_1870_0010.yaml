revised_title: 'Mineral Analysis of Meteorites: A New Method for Investigating Silicates'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Petrology
tldr: The author presents a new method for analyzing silicates in meteorites using
  hydrogen fluoride and ammonia, allowing for the determination of their mineral composition.
  The method is applied to over 140 aerolites, providing insight into their mineralogical
  makeup and contributing to a scientific classification of these celestial objects.
