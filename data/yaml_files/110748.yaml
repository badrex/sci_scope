revised_title: Compensations of Polarized Light and the Polarimeter for Measuring
  Degrees of Polarization
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Sir David Brewster, investigates the compensations of polarized
  light and develops a polarimeter to measure the degrees of polarization. He concludes
  that compensations are produced by equal and opposite rotations of the planes of
  polarization, and that the polarimeter can accurately measure these degrees.
