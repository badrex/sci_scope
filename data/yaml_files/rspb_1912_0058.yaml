revised_title: 'The Enzymes of Emulsin: Prunase and the Correlation of Prunasin'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the enzymes present in emulsin, specifically prunase
  and its correlation with prunasin. They find that prunase occurs in both the fruit
  and leaves of certain Prunus species, while amygdalase is primarily found in the
  seeds. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing between different enzymes
  and their specific actions.
