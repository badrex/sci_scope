revised_title: Wave Resistance of a Submerged Sphere
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Acoustics
tldr: The author investigates the wave resistance of a submerged sphere in water,
  finding that the resistance has the form const. * V^2 * d / (1 + d^2)^2, where V
  is the velocity of the sphere, d is the depth of the sphere, and const. is a constant
  value.
