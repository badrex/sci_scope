scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Cell Physiology
tldr: The author investigates skin currents in frogs, finding that the normal current
  is negative and the response to direct excitation is positive. The study also examines
  the effects of temperature and different types of electrical stimulation on the
  frog's skin.
