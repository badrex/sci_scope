revised_title: Determination of the Atomic Weight of Chlorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Atomic Weight
tldr: The author investigates the atomic weight of chlorine by burning hydrogen in
  an atmosphere of chlorine and condensing the hydrogen chloride formed. The results
  obtained agree closely with previous findings, suggesting a mean atomic weight of
  chlorine of 35.462.
