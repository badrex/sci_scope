  and Other Tissues
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The authors attempt to cultivate parasitic protozoa from malignant tumors, vaccinia,
  molluscum contagiosum, and normal tissues using sand and water as culture media.
  They conduct infection experiments and find no traces of protozoic life in any of
  the samples, suggesting that these organisms cannot be cultivated through this method.
