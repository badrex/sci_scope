revised_title: Development of Silver-Cadmium Alloys for Uniform Trial Plates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the properties of silver-cadmium alloys for use in uniform
  trial plates. They find that these alloys are more ductile and easier to assay than
  silver-copper alloys, and that they can be used to create standard trial plates
  with uniform composition.
