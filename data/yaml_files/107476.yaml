  Determining Altitudes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geophysics
tldr: The author, Thomas Greatorex, measures the height of Skiddaw mountain using
  a barometer and geometric leveling techniques, finding that the barometer's accuracy
  in determining altitudes may not be as precise as initially hoped.
