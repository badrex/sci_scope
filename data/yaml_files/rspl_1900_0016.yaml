revised_title: Investigation of Temperature Effects on Elasticities and Internal Viscosity
  of Metal Wires
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of temperature changes on the elasticities
  and internal viscosity of metal wires, focusing on the rigidity modulus and Young's
  modulus. They employ a unique experimental setup and thermo-electric couples to
  measure temperature and observe the changes in the wires' properties.
topics:
- Elasticity
- Viscosity
- Temperature Effects
- Metal Wires
- Torsional Elasticity
