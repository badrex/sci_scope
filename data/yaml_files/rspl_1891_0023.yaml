  and Their Applications in Studying Electrical Changes in Muscle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors improve the capillary electrometer method for investigating rapid
  electrical changes, such as those in muscle tissue. They discuss the factors affecting
  the instrument's time-relations and present a new method for analyzing the resulting
  curves. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their method by analyzing electrical
  variations in the frog's gastrocnemius muscle.
