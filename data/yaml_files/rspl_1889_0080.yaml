revised_title: 'Symmetrical Functions of the Roots of Systems of Equations: A Generalization
  of the Theory of Symmetric Functions'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This article extends the theory of symmetric functions to systems of equations,
  introducing new concepts such as partition operations and differential operations.
  It establishes three laws of symmetry and demonstrates their applications in solving
  various problems related to systems of equations.
topics:
- Algebraic Geometry
- Symmetric Functions
- Differential Operations
- Partition Theory
- Systems of Equations
