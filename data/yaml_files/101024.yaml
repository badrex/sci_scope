tldr: The authors present detailed observations and experiments on the structure and
  composition of the testes in various animals, including humans. They argue that
  the testes are made up of a network of vessels and liquids, with no intermediate
  substance or parenchyma. This challenges the prevailing views of other anatomists
  and physicians of the time.
