revised_title: 'The Effect of Pressure on Arc Spectra: Nickel Spectrum'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of pressure on the nickel arc spectrum, observing
  that the intensity of the lines increases with pressure and that the lines broaden
  and shift under increased pressure. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of metallic arc spectra under pressure and contributes to the understanding of spectral
  line broadening.
