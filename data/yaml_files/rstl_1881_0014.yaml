revised_title: On Toroidal Functions and Their Applications
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate toroidal functions, which are functions that satisfy
  Laplace's equation and are suitable for conditions on the surfaces of toroids. They
  explore various types of toroidal functions, including zonal, tesseral, and those
  suitable for toroids without a central opening, and provide examples of their applications
  in physics and engineering.
