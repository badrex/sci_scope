revised_title: Effects of Stress on the Magnetization of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This paper investigates the effects of stress on the magnetization of iron,
  nickel, and cobalt. The author finds that longitudinal pull diminishes magnetization
  when the magnetizing force is below a critical value, while transverse pull has
  the opposite effect. The study also explores the relationship between magnetic susceptibility
  and aeolotropic stress, as well as the influence of conductive aeolotropy on the
  magnetization of iron wire.
