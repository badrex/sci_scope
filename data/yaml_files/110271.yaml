revised_title: 'Researches in Physical Astronomy: Extending Equations for Planetary
  Inequalities'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics
tldr: J.W. Lubbock extends his equations for determining planetary inequalities, including
  terms depending on the cubes of eccentricities and quantities of that order. He
  applies this to the great inequality of Jupiter and recommends using indices to
  designate the arguments of planetary disturbances.
