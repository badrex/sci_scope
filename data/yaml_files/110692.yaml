revised_title: Experimental Research on the Strength of Cast Iron Pillars and Other
  Materials
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Structural Mechanics
tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson's experiments reveal that the strength of cast iron pillars
  is influenced by their dimensions, specifically the diameter and length. The study
  also compares the strength of cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and timber pillars,
  providing insights into their respective mechanical properties.
