scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: The author investigates longitudinal symmetry in Phanerogamia, demonstrating
  a method to record the quantitative relations between the distances of successive
  leaves. The study reveals inherent symmetry in plant growth and provides insights
  into the validity of mechanical theories of phyllotaxis.
