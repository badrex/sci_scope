tldr: The author examines the nature of death and its immediate causes, distinguishing
  between sensorial death and the cessation of all functions. He identifies five forms
  of death, including natural causes and those induced by stimulants, sedatives, and
  direct damage to vital organs. The author argues that death is not an act of suffering
  for the sentient being and that in many cases, the loss of sensibility is met with
  composure or satisfaction.
