revised_title: Cultural Experiments and the Evolution of 'Biologic Forms' in Erysiphace
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of injury on plant leaves and how it influences
  the infection of 'biologic forms' in the Erysiphace family. They discover that when
  the vitality of a leaf is affected, the restricted powers of infection of certain
  'biologic forms' break down, allowing them to infect previously immune host species.
