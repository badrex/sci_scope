tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, investigates the behavior of water between two glass
  planes in a hyperbolic curve. He finds that the same curve holds in all directions
  of the planes, with the asymptotes being the surface of the water and a line drawn
  along the touching sides. Hauksbee also observes that this phenomenon occurs in
  both air and vacuum, suggesting that the element has no significant impact on the
  behavior of water in this context.
