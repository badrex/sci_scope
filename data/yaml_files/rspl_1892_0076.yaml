revised_title: On the Theory of Compositions of Numbers and Multipartite Numbers
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Number Theory
tldr: The author investigates compositions of numbers and multipartite numbers, developing
  a graphical representation and analytical theory for these mathematical concepts.
  The study includes theorems and generating functions that enumerate compositions
  and compositions of multipartite numbers.
topics:
- Combinatorics
- Partitions
- Enumerative Combinatorics
- Graph Theory
- Number Theory
