tldr: This article reports on the unusual agitation of waters observed in Scotland
  and Hamburgh on November 1, 1756. In Scotland, the water rose suddenly and receded,
  causing boats to move rapidly on their ropes. In Hamburgh, churches experienced
  agitated candlesticks and baptisteries, while the water in canals and rivers exhibited
  gentle whirlpools, rising and subsiding with froth.
