revised_title: Carbonic Acid Excretion by Living Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the excretion of carbonic acid by living plants and
  discovers that various plant parts, such as bark, leaves, and roots, release carbon
  dioxide when exposed to specific conditions. The rate of gas release is influenced
  by factors such as temperature, light, and the activity of the plant's growth.
