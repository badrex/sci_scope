revised_title: An Investigation into the Arterial System of Slow-Moving Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the arterial systems of slow-moving animals, specifically
  the Lemur tardigradus and Bradypus tridactylus, and discovers a unique distribution
  of arteries in their limbs. This arrangement is hypothesized to contribute to the
  animals' slow movements by retarding the velocity of blood flow to the muscles.
