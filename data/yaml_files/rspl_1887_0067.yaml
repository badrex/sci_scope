revised_title: The Proteids of the Seeds of Abrus precatorius (Jequirity)
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: 'The author investigates the proteids found in the seeds of Abrus precatorius,
  also known as jequirity, and identifies two main proteids: a vegetable paraglobulin
  and a-phytalbumose. The study examines their properties and their potential similarities
  to proteids found in other plants, such as the papaw juice.'
