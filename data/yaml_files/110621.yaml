revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Equivalents of Certain Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Atomic Theory
tldr: Richard Phillips investigates the chemical equivalents of certain bodies, examining
  Dr. Prout and Dr. Thomson's theory that all atomic weights are simple multiples
  of hydrogen's atomic weight. He conducts experiments using silver as a basis and
  concludes that the equivalent numbers of hydrogen, oxygen, azote, and chlorine are
  1, 8, 14, and 36 respectively.
