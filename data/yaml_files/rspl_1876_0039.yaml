revised_title: 'Contact Electricity between Non-Conductors: Experiments and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrostatics & Electromechanics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to investigate the contact electricity between
  non-conductors, such as glass and wax, and observe the electrical displacement that
  occurs when they are in contact. They also discuss the role of specific inductive
  capacity in the process and suggest further research on more substances and quantitative
  measurements.
topics:
- Electrostatics
- 'No'
- Friction
- Electrical Displacement
- Specific Inductive Capacity
