scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Satellite Orbits
tldr: Richard Dunthorne presents new tables for the motions of Jupiter's satellites,
  providing elements for their orbits and eclipses. The tables are designed on the
  plan of those by Mr. Pound, with adjustments made for equations and synodical periods.
  The study also includes the excentricity of the third and fourth satellites' orbits
  and their nodes' movements.
