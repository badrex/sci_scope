revised_title: The Role of Cerebellum in Voluntary Motor Functions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on various animals to study the functions of
  the cerebellum. The results show that the cerebellum, along with the cerebrum, plays
  a crucial role in voluntary motor functions, particularly in maintaining balance
  and coordination in movements. The cerebellum is also found to have no involvement
  in common sensation, sexual propensity, involuntary muscle actions, or maintaining
  animal heat.
