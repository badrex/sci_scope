tldr: Gideon Mantell discovers the Iguanodon, a new fossil reptile, in the sandstone
  of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. He compares the teeth of the Iguanodon with those of
  a recent iguana and concludes that the Iguanodon was an herbivorous reptile of gigantic
  size, possibly up to 60 feet long. Mantell also discusses the vertebrae of the Iguanodon,
  which differ from those of recent reptiles but are similar to those of fossil crocodiles.
