revised_title: Revisiting the Effective Temperature of the Sun
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the effective temperature of the sun using a differential
  Boys' radio-micrometer and a platinum strip. The study aims to determine the effective
  solar temperature by considering various factors such as radiation loss from the
  heliostat mirror, absorption in the Earth's atmosphere, and the emissivity of the
  platinum strip. The author concludes that the effective temperature of the sun is
  approximately 6200°C.
