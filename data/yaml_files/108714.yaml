  Saturated Steam
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Thermodynamics
tldr: This supplement to Macquorn Rankine's paper on the thermodynamic theory of steam-engines
  with dry saturated steam provides additional information on the efficiency of steam-ships
  and their engines. It presents examples of paddle-steamers and screw-steamers, discussing
  their coal consumption, heat expended, and efficiency of steam and boilers.
topics:
- Stea
- Thermodynamics
- Heat Expended
- Boiler Efficiency
- Marine Boilers
