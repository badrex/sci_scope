tldr: The author investigates the formation of hexagonal ice crystals and hoar frost,
  observing their growth patterns and conditions necessary for their formation. They
  also compare these natural ice crystals with those found in refrigerating chambers,
  ships, and cooling cellars, concluding that they are identical in nature.
