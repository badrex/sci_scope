revised_title: Applying Aspherical Nucleus Theory to the Balmer Series of Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author applies the aspherical nucleus theory to the Balmer series of hydrogen,
  determining the Rydberg constant and asphericity of the hydrogen nucleus. The results
  show a notable deviation from the simple Balmer formula, with the hydrogen nucleus
  being oblate.
