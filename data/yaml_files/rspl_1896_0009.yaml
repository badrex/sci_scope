scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the liquation of gold in various alloys and its relationship
  with base metals such as lead and zinc. The study reveals that the distribution
  of gold in ingots is influenced by liquation, and the presence of lead and zinc
  affects the quality and distribution of gold in the alloy.
