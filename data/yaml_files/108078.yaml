scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Coastal Geology & Geomorphology
tldr: 'The author examines the motion and accumulation of shingle beaches, identifying
  three types of actions by the sea: accumulative, destructive, and progressive. The
  study focuses on the role of waves and currents in the movement of pebbles along
  the coast, concluding that wave action is the primary force behind the observed
  patterns.'
