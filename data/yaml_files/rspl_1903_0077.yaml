  and Function of the Brain''s Gyri'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study investigates the histological structure and function of different
  gyri in the brain, focusing on the central gyri, occipital, temporal, and limbic
  lobes. The research aims to establish a correlation between physiological function
  and histological structure, providing insights into the localization of brain functions
  and the understanding of neurological disorders.
