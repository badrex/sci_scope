tldr: The author, John Davy, investigates the temperature regulation and excretion
  in birds, finding that their high temperature is partly due to their low perspiration
  and slow cooling, as well as the large size of their kidneys and the excretion of
  urate of ammonia. He also suggests that other factors, such as a powerful heart,
  blood corpuscle structure, and blood viscosity, may contribute to their high temperature.
