tldr: The author investigates the relationship between host plants and parasites in
  the case of Bromus species and the Rust-fungus Puccinia dispersa. They develop a
  method to obtain pure cultures of both host and parasite using antiseptic-treated
  seeds and sterile tube-cultures, allowing for controlled infection experiments.
