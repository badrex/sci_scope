revised_title: Experiments on Carbon at High Temperatures and Under Great Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Material Science & Carbon Chemistry
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on carbon under high temperatures and pressures,
  using various fluids and substances to create dense forms of carbon for use in arc
  and incandescent lamps. They discovered that under high pressures, the deposit of
  carbon from hydrocarbons and other substances is sooty and unlike the hard steel-grey
  deposit formed at lower pressures. The experiments also led to the discovery of
  a substance with great hardness, potentially formed under similar conditions found
  in the Cape Diamond Mines.
