revised_title: A Comparative Study of Spectra, Densities, and Melting Points of Elements
  and Their Relation to Atomic Mass
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the spectra, densities, and melting points of various
  groups of elements and explores their relationship to atomic mass. The author finds
  that the positions of spectral lines change systematically with the increase of
  atomic mass, suggesting a graphical method for representing spectral lines as functions
  of atomic mass.
