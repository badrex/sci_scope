revised_title: Investigating the Relationship between Diurnal Range of Magnetic Declination
  and Horizontal Force with Solar Spot Frequency
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnetic declination
  and horizontal force at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1877, and
  compares it to the period of solar spot frequency. The study aims to understand
  the general magnetic condition of the Earth and the underlying phenomena of magnetic
  action.
