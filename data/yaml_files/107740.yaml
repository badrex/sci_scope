revised_title: An Experimental Investigation into the Nature of Radiant Heating Effects
  from Terrestrial Sources
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments to understand the nature of radiant heating
  effects from terrestrial sources, specifically focusing on the differences between
  heat evolved from luminous and non-luminous sources. The study examines the effects
  of screens and the relationship between different types of heat and surfaces, providing
  insights into the underlying principles of heat transfer.
