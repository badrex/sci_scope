tldr: This article presents a new approach to the theory of ternary cubics by introducing
  two derived covariants, CU and DU, which are linear functions of U and HUE. The
  author demonstrates how these covariants can be used to complete the system of contravariants
  and bring M. Aronhold's and his own previous work into harmony.
