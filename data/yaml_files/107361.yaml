tldr: The author examines the colors used in ancient paintings, focusing on the chemical
  composition of red pigments. Through experimentation, he identifies various red
  pigments, including minium (red oxide of lead) and cinnabar (vermilion), and discusses
  their use in ancient art. The study provides valuable insights into the materials
  and techniques employed by ancient artists.
