revised_title: Investigating the Specific Heat and Heat Flow in the Cylinder of the
  Internal Combustion Engine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Internal Combustion Engines
tldr: The author investigates the specific heat and heat flow in the cylinder of an
  internal combustion engine using a novel experimental method. By subjecting the
  heated products of combustion to alternate compression and expansion, the author
  determines the mean specific heat and the law of heat flow, providing valuable insights
  into the engine's performance and efficiency.
