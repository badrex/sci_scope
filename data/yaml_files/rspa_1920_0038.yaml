revised_title: Xenon Gas Disappearance and Spectral Analysis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the disappearance of xenon gas in vacuum tubes and analyzes
  its spectral lines. They find that xenon gas rapidly disappears when heavy currents
  are passed through tubes containing it, and that xenon allows the metal of the cathode
  to be thrown off more easily than any other gas. The spectral lines of krypton and
  xenon are also measured and compared.
