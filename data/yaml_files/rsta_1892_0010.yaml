revised_title: On the Kinematics of Collisions Between Elastic Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of energy among a system of elastic
  spheres during collisions and demonstrates that the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
  remains unaffected by these interactions. This study contributes to the understanding
  of the behavior of particles in statistical mechanics and the conservation laws
  governing elastic collisions.
