revised_title: Self-Induction of Electric Currents in a Thin Anchor-Ring
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the self-induction of electric currents in a thin anchor-ring
  and derives formulas for the self-induction of currents distributed over the circumference
  and the entire area of the ring's circular section. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of currents in magnetic fields and related phenomena.
