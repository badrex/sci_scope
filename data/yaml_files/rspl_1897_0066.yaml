revised_title: 'Magneto-Optic Phenomena of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt: Theory and Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate the magneto-optic phenomena of iron, nickel, and cobalt,
  developing a theory that predicts the effects of magnetic fields on light propagation.
  They compare their theoretical predictions with experimental results, finding good
  agreement and validating their theory.
topics:
- Magnet
- Iron
- Nickel
- Cobalt
- Magnetic Reflection
