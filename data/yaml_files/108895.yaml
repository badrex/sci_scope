  Lancashire and Yorkshire'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolution
tldr: The author examines fossil plants from the lower coal-seams of Lancashire and
  Yorkshire, providing detailed descriptions of their structure and evolution. The
  study reveals that Sigillaria gradually transforms into ribbed and furrowed Sigillaria
  as it ages, and that it possesses two woody cylinders and a central axis composed
  of hexagonal vessels. Evidence is also presented to support the idea that Stigmaria
  is the root of Sigillaria.
