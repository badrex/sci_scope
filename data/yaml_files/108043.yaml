tldr: The author examines the respiration and tracheal structures of insects in their
  different life stages, highlighting the changes in respiration, circulation, temperature,
  and food intake. The study focuses on the tracheal vessels and spiracles, and their
  role in the respiration process, as well as the differences in tracheal structures
  between larva, pupa, and perfect states.
