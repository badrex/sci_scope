scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: This article presents a preliminary study on the magnetization of iron at high
  temperatures. The author observes that the permeability of iron increases rapidly
  as the temperature rises, eventually reaching a maximum and then decreasing as the
  material loses its magnetizability. The findings suggest that magnetic moments of
  iron molecules diminish with increasing temperature.
