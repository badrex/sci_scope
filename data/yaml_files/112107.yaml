tldr: The author presents monthly magnetical observations taken at the College Observatory,
  Stonyhurst, in 1864, providing data on horizontal, vertical, and total forces, as
  well as the magnetic dip and deflection. The observations were used to calculate
  the ratio and product of the magnetic moment and the earth's horizontal magnetic
  intensity, contributing to the understanding of secular changes in magnetic forces.
