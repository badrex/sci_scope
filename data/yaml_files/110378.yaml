tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the nature of electrochemical decomposition,
  focusing on the conditions, influence of water, and the theory of electrochemical
  decomposition. He proposes that the effect is produced by an internal corpuscular
  action, modifying the affinities in particles through which the current passes,
  causing them to act with greater force in one direction and resulting in decomposition
  and recomposition, ultimately disengaging particles at the boundaries of the decomposing
  body.
