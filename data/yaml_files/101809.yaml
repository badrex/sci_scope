scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Histology
tldr: The author, Anthony Leeuwenhoeck, examines the structure of hair using a microscope
  and discovers that it consists of irregular particles, or clods, and strings or
  vessels. He compares the clods to tree bark and the strings to tree wood, suggesting
  that hair may have a similar internal structure.
