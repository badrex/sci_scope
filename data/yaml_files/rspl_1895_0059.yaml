revised_title: A Study on the Granular Leucocytes and Their Development
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure and development of granular leucocytes, dividing
  them into three main groups based on the presence or absence of granules. They argue
  that granules are an altered condition of the microsomes and are plasmatic, not
  paraplastic, playing a role in amoeboid movement.
