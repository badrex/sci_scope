  Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author describes the synthesis and properties of iodobenzoic, iodotoluylic,
  and iodanisic acids through a new method of substitution. These acids are produced
  by the action of hydriodic acid on nitrogenous acids of the benzoic group. The author
  also discusses the stability and solubility of these compounds and their potential
  applications in further experiments.
