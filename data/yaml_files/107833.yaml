tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the ratio of magnetic forces
  acting on horizontally suspended needles in Paris and London. The results showed
  that the magnetic intensity in Paris was 1.0714 times greater than in London, with
  variations in temperature taken into account.
