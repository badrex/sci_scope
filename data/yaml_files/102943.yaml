scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: Francis Hauksbee conducts an experiment to demonstrate the cause of mercury
  descent in a barometer during storms. He uses a setup with two barometers connected
  to a system that releases compressed air, causing the mercury to descend. The experiment
  shows that high winds can lessen the pressure of the atmosphere, and the mercury
  in the barometers subsides.
