revised_title: 'The Effect of Pressure on Arc Spectra: Silver and Gold'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of pressure on arc spectra of silver and
  gold, observing broadening, displacement, and reversal of lines under increased
  pressure. They also note the development of a banded spectrum in silver and the
  relationship between the banded spectrum and the first sub-series lines.
