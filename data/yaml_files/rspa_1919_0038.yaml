revised_title: Determination of the Secular Acceleration of the Moon's Longitude from
  Modern Observations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Lunar Dynamics
tldr: This article examines the determination of the secular acceleration of the Moon's
  longitude using modern observations. The author argues that the errors in the observations
  show a periodic character, and the precise value of the coefficient cannot be obtained
  until the source of the periodic term is known and its constants determined with
  considerable accuracy from the theory.
