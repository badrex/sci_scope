revised_title: An Application of Probability Theory to Epidemic Modeling
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Statistics
tldr: The authors apply probability theory to study the dynamics of hypothetical epidemics,
  developing equations to calculate death rates, birth rates, and reversion elements.
  They also discuss the impact of population size, immigration, and emigration on
  epidemic progression.
