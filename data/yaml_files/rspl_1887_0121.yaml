revised_title: Application of First Principles in Partial Differential Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Differential Equations
tldr: The authors explore the direct application of first principles in the theory
  of partial differential equations, discussing the non-analytical exposition of differential
  criteria of algebraic functionality by Jacobi and the analysis of partial differential
  equations of the first and second order, particularly those named after Lagrange,
  Monge, and Ampere.
topics:
- Partial Differential Equations
- Algebraic Functionality
- Jacobi's Differential Criteria
- Lagrange Equations
- Monge Equations
