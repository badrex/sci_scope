revised_title: Estimating the Annual Contraction of the Earth's Globe and its Implications
  on Volcanic Energy
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between volcanic energy and the contraction
  of the Earth's globe due to refrigeration. By making certain assumptions about the
  Earth's interior, the author calculates the annual contraction and its implications
  on volcanic activity and the thickness of the Earth's crust.
topics:
- Volcanic Energy
- Earth's Contraction
- Heat Dissipation
- Geothermal Energy
- Rock Mechanics
