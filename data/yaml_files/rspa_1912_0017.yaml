revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Temperature on Radioactive Disintegration
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The author examines the effect of temperature on the decay of radioactive materials,
  specifically radium C, emanation, and the active deposit. The study finds that neither
  the 3-ray nor the 7-ray activities of these materials experience any change in activity
  or decay rate at high temperatures. The observed temperature effects can be explained
  by changes in the distribution of active matter within the quartz tubes and the
  average path of 3-rays through the tubes.
