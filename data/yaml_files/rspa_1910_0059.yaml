revised_title: Investigating the Direction of Motion of Electrons Ejected by Ultra-Violet
  Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Particle Physics
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to determine if electrons ejected from atoms
  by ultra-violet light have a component of velocity in the direction of light propagation.
  The results show that there is a significant asymmetry in the leaks produced by
  the electrons, suggesting that the ejected electrons have a component of velocity
  in the direction of light propagation.
