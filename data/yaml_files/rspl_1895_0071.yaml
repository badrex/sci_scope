revised_title: 'Octonions: A New Approach to Geometric Algebra'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Geometry
tldr: The author introduces the concept of octonions, a generalization of quaternions,
  and explores their applications in geometry, physics, and algebra. Octonions provide
  a more comprehensive and versatile mathematical framework for studying complex geometric
  transformations and physical phenomena.
topics:
- Geometric Algebra
- Octonions
- Clifford Algebras
- Vector Analysis
- Mathematical Physics
