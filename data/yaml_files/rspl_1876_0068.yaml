scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: Professor Tyndall conducts experiments on the effects of alkalized urine and
  temperature on microbial growth. He finds that even at high temperatures, no life
  forms develop after the urine is neutralized with potash, supporting the idea that
  spontaneous generation does not occur.
