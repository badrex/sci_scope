scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a new method for separating iron from other metals, which
  involves oxidizing the iron, neutralizing the solution with carbonate of ammonia,
  and precipitating the iron as a sub-salt. This method is efficient, accurate, and
  applicable to a wide range of samples, making it a valuable tool in the analysis
  of minerals and metals.
