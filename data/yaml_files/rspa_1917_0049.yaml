revised_title: Investigating Congenital Night-Blindness and its Impact on Color Perception
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Vision Science
tldr: The author examines two cases of congenital night-blindness and investigates
  the differences in color perception and light sensitivity between night-blind and
  normal vision. The study suggests that the extinction of feeble white light is dependent
  on a different retinal perception in night-blind individuals compared to those with
  normal vision.
