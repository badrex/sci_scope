revised_title: The Peculiar Conductivity of Monatomic Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the electric discharge in monatomic gases, specifically
  helium and argon, and find that their conductivity is relatively low compared to
  other gases. They discover that the behavior of these gases is due to their molecular
  structure and that their conductivity increases with pressure, suggesting that the
  difference between monatomic and other gases is one of degree.
