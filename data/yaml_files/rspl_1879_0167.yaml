revised_title: Investigating the Spectrum of Hydrogen Flame
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author examines the spectrum of the hydrogen flame and discovers a group
  of lines in the ultra-violet region. The spectrum is likely due to the vapor of
  water, and further experiments are conducted to analyze the presence of carbon and
  its compounds in the flame.
