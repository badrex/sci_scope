scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines the temperature differences between flowers, leaves, and
  grass, and how they are influenced by meteorological conditions and plant characteristics.
  The study reveals that in most cases, grass is colder than flowers, and that temperature
  variations depend on factors such as the time of day, cloud cover, and plant species.
