tldr: The author, Mr. John Kuncle, disputes Dr. Voight's claims on the nature of acids
  and heat. Kuncle argues that spirit of wine is not a pure acid and that no pure
  acid is inflammable. He also claims that oils are the most subtle parts of bodies
  and that all bodies are set together and compounded with salt.
