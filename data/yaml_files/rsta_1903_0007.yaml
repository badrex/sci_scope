revised_title: Stability of the Pear-Shaped Figure of Equilibrium in a Rotating Mass
  of Liquid
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: G. H. Darwin investigates the stability of the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium
  in a rotating mass of liquid using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis. He determines
  the energy lost in the process of concentration from a condition of infinite dispersion
  into the final configuration and provides a numerical calculation to prove the stability
  of the pear-shaped figure.
