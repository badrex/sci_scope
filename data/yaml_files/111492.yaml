tldr: The author investigates the flow and motion of the Mer de Glace glacier, confirming
  previous findings on the swifter flow of central portions and the effect of valley
  curvature on flow direction. He also examines the behavior of ice under pressure,
  including the formation of bands of white ice and the crumpling of ice structures,
  and concludes that ice fragility and regelation play a significant role in these
  phenomena.
