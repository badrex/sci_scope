revised_title: Improvements in the Lunar Theory and Sun's Horizontal Parallax
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Dynamical Astronomy
tldr: The author discusses improvements in the lunar theory by extending approximation
  methods and reducing the complexity of calculations. The author also estimates the
  sun's horizontal parallax to be around 8", close to the mean of observed transit
  results.
