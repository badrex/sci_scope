revised_title: On the Law of Distribution of Molecular Velocities and the Theory of
  Viscosity and Thermal Conduction in a Non-Uniform Simple Monatomic Gas
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors develop a theory for the distribution of molecular velocities in
  a non-uniform gas and apply it to the study of viscosity and thermal conduction.
  They provide a general formula for the velocity-distribution function and demonstrate
  its application to various molecular models, leading to more accurate predictions
  of gas behavior.
topics:
- Kinetic Theory of Gases
- Velocity Distribution Function
- Viscosity
- Thermal Conduction
- 'No'
