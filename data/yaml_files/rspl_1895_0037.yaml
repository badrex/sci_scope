revised_title: The Refractive Index of Water at Temperatures between 0째C and 10째C
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the refractive index of water at various temperatures
  between 0째C and 10째C, finding that the index increases continuously up to the freezing
  point. The rate of increase appears to change around the temperature of maximum
  density, as noted by Gladstone and Dale.
