  Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the values of Laplace's coefficients and their applications
  in radiation theory, particularly in the context of heat conduction and spherical
  harmonics. The study focuses on the expansion of temperature functions and the determination
  of the stationary condition for a spherical ball exposed to radiation from an infinitely
  distant source.

- Laplace's Coefficients
- Integral Calculus
- Radiation Theory
