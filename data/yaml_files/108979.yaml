revised_title: Investigating Lunar-Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Declination
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author analyzes the hourly records of magnetic declination at the Flagstaff
  Observatory in Melbourne, discussing the lunar-diurnal variation and its relationship
  to the moon's declination. The study reveals that irregularities in the variation
  depend on the moon's position relative to the equator, and that the sun and moon
  both influence the phenomenon.
