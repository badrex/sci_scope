revised_title: Investigations on the Thickness of Soap Films
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The authors investigate the thickness and optical properties of soap films,
  using a unique experimental setup to measure the resistance offered by the films
  to electric current. They observe the rapid increase in film thickness near the
  black boundary and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding
  the behavior of liquid films.
