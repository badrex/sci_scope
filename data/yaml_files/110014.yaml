revised_title: Chemical Analysis and Formation of Newry Pitch-Stone and Pumice
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: George Knox examines the chemical composition of Newry Pitch-Stone and its products,
  discovering a variable proportion of a peculiar bitumen. He also demonstrates that
  by heating the residue, it transforms into pumice due to the slow escape of bituminous
  matter, creating a vesicular structure.
