revised_title: A New Method of Freezing at a Distance Using a Cryophorus
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cryogenics & Low Temperature Physics
tldr: The author describes a new method of freezing water at a distance using a Cryophorus,
  a glass tube with two balls connected by a bent tube. The device creates a vacuum
  that allows for the transfer of cold temperatures, enabling water in one ball to
  freeze when the other ball is immersed in a freezing mixture.
