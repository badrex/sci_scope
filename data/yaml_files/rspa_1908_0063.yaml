revised_title: 'The Electrolytic Properties of Diluted Solutions of Sulphuric Acid:
  Part 1'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrolytic properties of diluted solutions of
  sulphuric acid and find that the decrease in equivalent conductivity at extreme
  dilutions is not due to impurities in the solvent. They propose that the phenomenon
  depends on the presence of the hydrogen ion in acids, which travels slower at great
  dilutions than at moderate concentrations.
