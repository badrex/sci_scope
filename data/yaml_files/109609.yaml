tldr: John Pearson examines two mummies of Egyptian Ibis birds, one in perfect condition,
  and describes their preservation methods. He compares the techniques used in the
  embalming process and discusses the state of decay in the second mummy. Pearson
  also notes the presence of scarabaei and dermestide larvae, suggesting that the
  birds were not always in a fresh state during the embalming process.
