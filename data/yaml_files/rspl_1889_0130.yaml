revised_title: Nicotine's Effects on the Autonomic Nervous System
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of nicotine on the autonomic nervous system,
  specifically the sympathetic nervous system and cervical sympathetic ganglion. They
  find that nicotine causes unequal paralysis of the nerve cells, leading to differences
  in responses such as dilation of the pupil, constriction of blood vessels, and secretion
  of saliva.
