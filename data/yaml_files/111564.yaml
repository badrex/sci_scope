revised_title: The Intensification of Sound through Solid Bodies with Water Interposition
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author, S. Scott Alison, investigates the intensification of sound through
  solid bodies by interposing water between them and the distal extremities of hearing-tubes.
  He discovers that sounds become more augmented when water is used, and explains
  that this effect is due to the complete fitting of the liquid on the solid body
  and the reduced impedance of the instrument when in contact with water.
