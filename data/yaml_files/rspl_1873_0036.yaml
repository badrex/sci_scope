scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author investigates the intracellular development of blood-corpuscles in
  mammalian connective tissue, particularly in newborn rats. They observe the formation
  of blood vessels and the development of red and white blood cells within the cells,
  providing insights into the process of hematopoiesis and capillary formation.
