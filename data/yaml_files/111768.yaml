revised_title: Decomposition of Neutral Fatty Bodies Using Steam
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: George Wilson's experiments show that neutral fatty bodies can be decomposed
  into glycerine and fatty acids using steam at a uniform high temperature. Various
  types of fats, including palm oil, coconut oil, and animal tallow, have yielded
  successful results in this process.
