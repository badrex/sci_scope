revised_title: Magnetic Induction and Internal Friction in Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, specifically focusing on the magnetic induction and internal friction
  of iron, nickel, and cobalt. The study uses magnetic cycles of very minute range
  and reveals various factors affecting the magnetic properties of these metals, such
  as accommodation, mechanical strain, and temperature changes.
