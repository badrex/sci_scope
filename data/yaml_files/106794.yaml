revised_title: Investigating the Cause of Additional Weight in Metals Upon Calcination
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Materials
tldr: The author investigates the cause of additional weight metals acquire when calcined,
  focusing on zinc. Through a series of experiments, he determines that the weight
  gain is not due to the presence of phlogiston but rather the interaction of the
  metal with the acid, alkali, or water used during the process.
