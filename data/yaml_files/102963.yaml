tldr: In this letter, Anthony van Leuwenhoek describes his observations and experiments
  on staining fingers with a silver solution in Aqua Fortis. He discovers that the
  stained skin contains tiny silver globules and provides a detailed microscopic analysis
  of these particles. He also shares his experience of removing the silver particles
  from his skin using Aqua Fortis.
