tldr: 'This paper by A. Cayley explores the theory of skew surfaces and scrolls generated
  by lines meeting given curves. It covers three types of surfaces: S(m, n, p), S(m2,
  n), and S(m3). The author presents a table of results and discusses the singularity
  of curves in space, including a new type of singularity involving lines through
  four points.'
