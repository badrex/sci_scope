revised_title: 'Spectroscopic Analysis of Radiant Matter: The Discovery of Earth Yα'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: William Crookes investigates the spectroscopy of radiant matter and discovers
  a new earth, Yα, which has unique phosphorescent properties. He compares it to Marignac's
  Ya and J. Lawrence Smith's mosandra, finding similarities in their chemical characteristics
  and spectra.
