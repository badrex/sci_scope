tldr: The author describes the discovery of glands in the dura mater, which he believes
  play a role in maintaining the moisture of the brain and its membranes. These glands,
  called 'conglobate glands,' are found in the longitudinal sinus and are connected
  to the pia mater via fine fibers. The author also discusses the possible consequences
  of an imbalance in the secretion of this humor, which can lead to various diseases.
