revised_title: Investigating Unidirectional Currents in Alternating Current Systems
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The author demonstrates the existence of an excess of current in one direction
  to earth in an alternating current system, which can occur through dielectric leakage
  or small faults in the cables. This phenomenon is explained by the polarization
  effect caused by positive charges in the cables, which increases the resistance
  of the leakage and is cleared by the subsequent negative charge.
