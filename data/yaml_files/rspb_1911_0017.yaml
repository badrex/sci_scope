scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the infectivity of Glossina palpalis
  fed on sleeping sickness patients under treatment. They found that mechanical transmission
  of the disease from treated patients to normal monkeys was negative, and that sleeping
  sickness was not transmitted from any patient to monkeys by the flies in the second
  method of transmission.
