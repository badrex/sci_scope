revised_title: Investigation of the Nature and Production of β-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Particle Physics & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors study the nature and production of β-rays using radium and cathode
  rays. They find that the chance of a β-ray making another β-ray is roughly proportional
  to the atomic weight of the radiator. The results suggest that β-radiation is most
  likely produced when the β-ray is suddenly stopped or loses a great part of its
  energy.
