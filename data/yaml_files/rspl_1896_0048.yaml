scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the concept of telegony, a phenomenon where offspring
  resemble a previous mate of their mother, and examines its potential influence on
  heredity using family measurements. The study finds mixed results and suggests that
  further research is needed to determine the validity of telegonic influence in humans.
