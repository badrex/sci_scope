scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author synthesizes phosphorus pentafluoride and studies its properties,
  including its color, reactivity with ammonia, and its stability. The gas is found
  to be colorless, incombustible, and absolutely irrespirable. It decomposes water,
  forms compounds with ammonia, and does not condense under high pressure.
