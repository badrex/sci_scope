tldr: The Great Melbourne Telescope, a four-foot reflector Cassegrain telescope, was
  constructed in 1865-1866 by Thomas Grubb under the direction of a committee including
  the late Earl of Rosse and Dr. Robinson. The telescope features a metal speculum
  instead of silvered glass, a unique design that offers convenience to the observer
  and improved performance. The article provides a detailed account of the telescope's
  design, construction, and testing, as well as the challenges faced and solutions
  implemented during the process.
