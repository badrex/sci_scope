revised_title: Investigations of Residual Charge Phenomena in Strained Material, Leyden
  Jars, and Voltameters
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate the residual charge phenomena in Leyden jars, voltameters,
  and strained material, proposing a method to determine the constants in Maxwell's
  differential equation and providing insights into the specific power of different
  materials in producing residual charge phenomena.
