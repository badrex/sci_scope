revised_title: On the Long Spectrum of Electric Light and Metallic Spectra
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the long spectrum of electric light and discovers that
  it extends six to eight times the length of the visible spectrum. They also study
  the metallic spectra and the absorption of high refrangibility rays by various substances,
  leading to the development of a new method for observing the mode of absorption.
