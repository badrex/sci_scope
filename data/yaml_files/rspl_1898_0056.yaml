revised_title: Investigating the Source of Röntgen Rays in Focus Tubes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The author explores the source of Röntgen rays in focus tubes using a specialized
  camera and pin-hole photography. They observe that the active area's dimensions
  and intensity vary with the degree of exhaustion and distance between the cathode
  and anti-cathode. The study also reveals that a significant portion of Röntgen rays
  comes from the glass of the tube that shows green fluorescence.
