revised_title: Ionic Velocities and Kohlrausch's Theory
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the ionic velocities in electrolytes and discuss the
  validity of Kohlrausch's theory, which assumes that all dissolved salt molecules
  are actively involved in conveying the electric current. They argue that the theory
  can be reconciled with the idea that only a fraction of the molecules are active,
  as the effective velocity of ions remains the same in both cases.
