scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author explores the elasticity of the lungs and its role in respiration,
  conducting experiments to determine the extent of the power required to expand the
  lungs in living organisms. The study highlights the importance of lung elasticity
  in the respiratory system and its connection to other organs, such as the heart
  and diaphragm.
