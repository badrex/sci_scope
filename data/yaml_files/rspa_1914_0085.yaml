revised_title: Investigating the Production of Rare Gases through Electric Discharge
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Synthesis
tldr: The author, J. Norman Collie, examines T. R. Merton's apparatus and experiments
  to produce rare gases through electric discharge. Collie conducts multiple experiments
  using uranium bombardment and discusses the presence of neon, helium, and nitrogen
  in the residual gases. The origin of these gases remains uncertain, and further
  research is needed to determine their source.
