revised_title: Perturbations of the Perissads and Their Atomic Weights
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the perturbations of the perissads (elements of uneven
  atomicity) and develops a mathematical model to represent their atomic weights.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of these elements and their potential
  applications in various fields.
