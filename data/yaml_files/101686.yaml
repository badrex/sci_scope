revised_title: Experiments on the Preservation of Bodies in a Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Food Chemistry & Preservation
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using an air pump to study the preservation
  of various foods and materials in a vacuum. They find that some items, such as fruits
  and meat, decompose more slowly in a vacuum, while others, like butter, maintain
  their quality. The experiments demonstrate the potential for vacuum preservation
  in transporting goods to places where they couldn't otherwise be sent.
