  Investigation into the Temperature Dependence of Hysteresis'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This study investigates the effects of prolonged heating on the magnetic properties
  of iron, particularly the hysteresis, at various temperatures. The results show
  that hysteresis increases with time and temperature, but at higher temperatures,
  a maximum value is reached, followed by a decrease in hysteresis with further heating.
