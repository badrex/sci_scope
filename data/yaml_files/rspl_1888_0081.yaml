revised_title: 'Determination of the Viscosity of Water: A New Method and Results'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Rheology
tldr: This study presents a new method for determining the viscosity of water using
  a novel apparatus and explores the relationship between velocity, temperature, and
  viscosity. The results show that the force tending to turn the inner cylinder can
  be represented by the sum of two terms, one varying as the velocity and the other
  as the square of the velocity. The viscosity constant deduced from these experiments
  agrees closely with that obtained from Poiseuille's experiments on the flow of liquids
  through capillary tubes.
