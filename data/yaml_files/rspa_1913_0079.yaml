revised_title: Investigating the Temperature Coefficient of a Kew Collimator Magnet
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the temperature coefficient of a Kew collimator magnet
  and develop a compensating magnetometer to eliminate the effect of uniform disturbing
  fields. They find that the temperature coefficient is not significant and does not
  affect the accuracy of the magnet's readings.
