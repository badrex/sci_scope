revised_title: Innovative Maritime Instruments for Sounding Depths and Fetching Water
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: 'The author presents two innovative instruments for seafaring: one for sounding
  depths without a cord and another for fetching up water from the sea''s depth. The
  first instrument uses a weighted ball and a springing wire, while the second is
  a wooden bucket with moveable bottoms. These devices can help determine depth, salinity,
  and the presence of sweet water at the bottom of the sea.'
