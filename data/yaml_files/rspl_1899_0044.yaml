tldr: This study compares platinum and gas thermometers and determines the boiling
  point of sulphur on the nitrogen scale. The research involved collaboration between
  the Kew Observatory Committee and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
  at Sevres. The platinum and gas thermometers were compared at over 150 different
  points, and the boiling point of sulphur was found to be 445.27 degrees on the constant
  volume nitrogen scale.
