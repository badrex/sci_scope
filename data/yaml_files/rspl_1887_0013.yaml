revised_title: 'A New Perspective Microscope: Constant Magnification and Its Applications'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors present a new perspective microscope that provides constant magnification
  along the optic axis, allowing for improved artistic and scientific applications.
  The microscope's design involves two thin lenses at varying distances, offering
  advantages in magnification, field of view, and penetration. The optical conditions
  of this system are discussed, and the potential for further development is explored.
