tldr: The author examines the geographic distribution of the Schoenese sub-order of
  Cyperaceae and suggests that it originated in prehistoric times at a center in the
  Antarctic region. The study reveals that the sub-order has spread northward and
  that two main genera, Schoenus and Cladium, have developed a large number of species,
  with some becoming cosmopolitan.
