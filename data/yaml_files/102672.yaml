revised_title: The Spontaneous Ascention of Water in Small Tubes Open at Both Ends

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducts an experiment at Gresham College to demonstrate that the
  seemingly spontaneous ascent of water in small tubes open at both ends is the same
  in a vacuum as in open air. He observes that water rises in the tubes when they
  are submerged in liquid and the air is removed, and that the height of the water
  column depends on the tube's size. The experiment supports the idea that capillary
  action is responsible for the water's ascent.
