revised_title: 'Inertness of Argon and Helium: Attempts to Pass Through Red-hot Metals'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: Ramsay and Travers attempted to pass helium or argon through red-hot palladium,
  platinum, or iron but found no transpiration of gas. This experiment further supports
  the inertness of these gases and their inability to form compounds with the tested
  metals.
