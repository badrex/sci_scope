revised_title: Investigating Dielectric Hysteresis in a Condenser
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine if the additional dissipation of
  energy in a condenser is due to dielectric hysteresis or viscosity in the dielectric.
  They find that the charge of the condenser is the same for a given potential difference,
  regardless of whether it has been arrived at from higher or lower values, suggesting
  that hysteresis is not present in this case.
