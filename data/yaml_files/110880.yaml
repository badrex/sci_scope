revised_title: Investigating the Impact of Root-Excretions on Crop Rotation and Inorganic
  Matter Absorption
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Agronomy & Soil Science
tldr: Charles G. B. Daubeny investigates the effects of crop rotation and root excretions
  on the absorption of inorganic matter by plants. He finds that root excretions have
  a limited impact on crop growth, and that the availability of inorganic matter in
  the soil plays a more significant role in crop productivity.
