revised_title: 'Selective Absorption of Röntgen Rays: Evidence for Heterogeneous Radiation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the absorption of Röntgen rays by various substances
  and finds evidence of selective absorption and heterogeneous radiation. The results
  suggest that different substances affect Röntgen rays differently, and fluorescent
  substances show the most significant differences in absorption compared to tinfoil.
topics:
- Röntgen Rays
- Selective Absorption
- Radiation Homogeneity
- Substance Interaction
- Fluorescent Substances
