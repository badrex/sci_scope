revised_title: The Negative Geotropism of Bacterium Zopfii
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The authors investigate the growth patterns of Bacterium Zopfii on gelatine
  and find that it exhibits negative geotropism, meaning it grows upright regardless
  of the orientation of its environment. They also observe that temperature and light
  affect the growth's regularity and symmetry.
