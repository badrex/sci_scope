revised_title: 'The Specific Heat of Alcohol and Water Mixtures: Experimental Results
  and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors, A. Dupr√© and F. J. M. Page, investigate the specific heat of various
  mixtures of alcohol and water. They find that the specific heat of these mixtures
  is higher than that of water itself, up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%. The
  authors also compare their results with previous research by Regnault and Kopp.
