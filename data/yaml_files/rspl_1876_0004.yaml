revised_title: On the Mechanics of River Windings in Alluvial Plains
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & River Dynamics
tldr: The author explains the mechanics behind river windings in alluvial plains,
  demonstrating how hydraulic principles cause water to flow differently along the
  inner and outer banks of bends, leading to erosion and deposition patterns.
