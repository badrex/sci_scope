revised_title: Temperature Influence on the Electric Conducting-Power of Thallium
  and Iron
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the electric conducting-power
  of thallium and iron. They find that thallium and iron exhibit different percentage
  decrements in conducting-power compared to other metals, and discuss the implications
  of these findings for understanding the behavior of metals and their alloys.
