revised_title: Investigating a Spectrum Associated with Carbon in Relation to Wolf-Rayet
  Stars
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates a spectrum associated with carbon and its potential
  relation to the Wolf-Rayet stars. The spectrum was produced using vacuum tubes with
  carbon electrodes and heavy condensed discharges. The observed lines appear to coincide
  with some of the most prominent lines in the Wolf-Rayet spectrum, suggesting a possible
  connection between the two.
