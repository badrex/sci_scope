revised_title: Investigating the Reliability of Fermentation Tests in Differentiating
  Streptococci
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author examines the reliability of fermentation tests in differentiating
  streptococci and finds that the tests are highly variable and not suitable for accurate
  classification. The results suggest that bacterial adaptation and variation make
  it difficult to establish fixed identities and reliable criteria for classification.
