revised_title: Investigating the Yield Point of Iron and Steel and the Effect of Repeated
  Straining and Annealing
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author examines the yield point of iron and steel and its relation to repeated
  straining and annealing. The study reveals that the yield point is a result of a
  physical change in the material and can be influenced by the process of annealing.
