revised_title: 'An Electrostatic Voltmeter for Photographic Recording of Atmospheric
  Potential: Development and Application'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The authors develop an electrostatic voltmeter for photographic recording of
  atmospheric potential, using a Dolezalek electrometer and a zinc-copper voltmeter.
  They describe the design, adjustments, and performance of the instruments, as well
  as the use of sulfur as an insulator. The voltmeter promises to be a valuable tool
  in atmospheric potential research.
