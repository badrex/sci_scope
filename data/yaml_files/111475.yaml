scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the surface formed by planes through the points of an
  ellipsoid at right angles to the radius vectors from the center. The surface, known
  as Talbot's curve, is found to have nodal conics in each of the principal planes
  and a cuspidal curve.
