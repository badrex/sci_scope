scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study examines the giant nerve cells and fibers in the marine worm Halla
  parthenopeia, revealing their structure, arrangement, and relationship to neurofibrils.
  The research also compares these features to those of Aglaurides fulgida, another
  marine worm, and discusses the similarities and differences between the two species.
