scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Physiology & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the function of chlorophyll in photosynthesis, finding
  that it plays a crucial role in the absorption of radiant energy, the production
  of formaldehyde, and the setting free of oxygen. The study supports the idea that
  chlorophyll is a stage in photosynthesis, and the author provides methods for separating
  and purifying chlorophyll, carotin, and xanthophyll for further research.
