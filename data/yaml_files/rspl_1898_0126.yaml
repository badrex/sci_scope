scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Vector Biology
tldr: The author reports on experiments conducted in Calcutta, observing the transmission
  of Proteosoma to birds through mosquitoes. The study found that mosquitoes fed on
  infected birds contained pigmented bodies in their stomach walls, which later developed
  into coccidia. This research contributes to understanding the role of mosquitoes
  in the spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.
