  in Steel and Iron by Percussion: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, William Scoresby, investigates the development of magnetic properties
  in steel and iron through percussion. He compares the effectiveness of the compound
  process, which uses two iron rods, to the simple process, which only uses one rod.
  The compound process is found to be more effective, but its efficacy is affected
  by the length of the steel wire and the size of the iron rods. The author also observes
  that softer steel wires are more susceptible to magnetism.
