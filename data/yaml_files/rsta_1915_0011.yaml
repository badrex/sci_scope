revised_title: 'Heats of Dilution of Concentrated Solutions: Hydrochloric Acid, Lithium
  Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, and Calcium Chloride'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the heat generated or absorbed during the dilution of
  concentrated solutions, focusing on hydrochloric acid, lithium chloride, sodium
  hydroxide, and calcium chloride. The author presents a new method for measuring
  the heat of dilution, which involves adding a small amount of water to the concentrated
  solution, allowing for more accurate temperature measurements and better control
  of the experiment.
topics:
- Thermal Properties of Solutions
- Dilution
- Heat Capacity
- Chemical Thermodynamics
- Calorimetry
