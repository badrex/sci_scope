revised_title: 'Dorsal Dermal Spine of the Hylaeosaurus: A Fossil Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines a dorsal dermal spine of the Hylaeosaurus, a prehistoric
  reptile, recently discovered in Tilgate Forest. The study provides evidence that
  the spine's internal structure is identical to that of the dermal scutes of the
  Hylaeosaurus, supporting the theory that these spines were part of the dermal system
  rather than the costal system.
