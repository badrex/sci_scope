revised_title: Experimental Investigations of Radiation and Repulsion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the repulsion resulting from radiation and
  develops a photometer called the 'Bathometer' or 'Light-Mill' to measure the amount
  of incident light. The author also investigates the behavior of radiometers under
  various conditions, including the effect of dark heat and the influence of different
  colors.
