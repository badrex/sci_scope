revised_title: Spectroscopic Investigation of the Xanthophyll Group of Yellow Colouring
  Matters
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the xanthophyll group of yellow colouring matters found
  in flowers, leaves, and fruits. Through spectroscopic observations, the author distinguishes
  three distinct yellow colouring matters and discusses their characteristics, absorption
  bands, and chemical properties. The study provides insights into the relationship
  between these colouring matters and their potential role in the depth of colour
  in flowers.
