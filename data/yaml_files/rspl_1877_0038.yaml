revised_title: On the Amplitude of Sound-Waves and Its Relation to Audibility
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author investigates the amplitude of sound-waves and determines the maximum
  amplitude of audible sound using a whistle and a siphon manometer. The experiment
  reveals that the amplitude of the aerial particles is less than a ten-millionth
  of a centimeter, suggesting that even very small amplitudes can still be heard under
  certain conditions.
