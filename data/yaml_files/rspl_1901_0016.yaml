revised_title: 'A New Manometer and the Law of Pressure of Gases: Investigations on
  Bessemer Flames'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author presents a new manometer capable of measuring small pressures with
  high accuracy and investigates the behavior of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen gases.
  Additionally, the study examines the spectra of Bessemer flames, discovering new
  lines and bands, and identifies elements such as rubidium, cesium, calcium, copper,
  silver, and gallium.
topics:
- Manometry
- Gas Pressure
- Bessemer Process
