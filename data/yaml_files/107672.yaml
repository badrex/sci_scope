revised_title: Investigating Electrical Phenomena in Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates electrical phenomena in a vacuum using mercury
  vapor and other substances. He discovers that the intensity of electrical light
  and charge depends on the temperature and density of the vapor, and that the vacuum
  is permeable to electricity.
