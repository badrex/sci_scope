revised_title: Investigating the Electrical Conductivity of Flames Containing Salt
  Vapors
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity of flames containing salt
  vapors and find that nearly all ionization occurs at the surfaces of glowing electrodes.
  They also discover that the velocity of negative ions in the flame is much greater
  than the corresponding velocity of positive ions, which helps explain the phenomena
  of unipolar conduction.
