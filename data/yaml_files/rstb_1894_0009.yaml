  Polypinum
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Protozoology & Cell Biology
tldr: The author investigates the digestive processes and formation of food vacuoles
  in Carchesium polypinum, observing the ingestion, digestion, and ejection of various
  particles. The study reveals the role of ciliary action in the intracellular digestion
  and the formation of food vacuoles, providing insights into the protozoan digestive
  system.
