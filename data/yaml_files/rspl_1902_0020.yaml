revised_title: Interpreting Photographic Records of Nerve Response with the Capillary
  Electrometer
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the influence of physical and experimental conditions
  on photographic records of nerve response using the capillary electrometer. By applying
  a process of interpretation based on physical grounds, the author aims to discover
  the results due to physiological differences and separate them from those caused
  by physical factors.
