revised_title: The Role of Respiration in Plant Leaves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the respiration of plant leaves using a unique
  apparatus. He concludes that healthy leaves restore the surrounding air by absorbing
  carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, this process is enhanced by light. Carbon dioxide
  is not released during the healthy state of the leaf, and the first portions of
  carbon dioxide in an artificial atmosphere are taken up more eagerly by plants.
