tldr: John Davy investigates the temperature of humans within the tropics, comparing
  it to a temperate climate, and observes fluctuations, effects of exertion, and the
  relationship between surface and deep-seated body temperatures. He concludes that
  variation in temperature, within certain limits, is conducive to health.
