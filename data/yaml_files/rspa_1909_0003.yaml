revised_title: A Comparative Analysis of Radium Emanation Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors compare the radium emanation spectra obtained by different observers
  and find that the spectrum attributed to radium emanation is mainly a compound of
  the xenon spectra obtained with and without a Leyden jar. They conclude that there
  has likely been an unsuspected contamination with xenon in the experiments of Cameron
  and Ramsay.
