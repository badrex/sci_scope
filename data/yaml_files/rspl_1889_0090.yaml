revised_title: 'The Effect of Spectrum on Haloid Salts of Silver: Improved Measurements
  and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of the spectrum on the sensitiveness of haloid
  salts of silver using gas light and improved measurement techniques. They find that
  the sensitiveness varies across the spectrum, with significant differences in density
  and sensitiveness between different parts of the spectrum.
