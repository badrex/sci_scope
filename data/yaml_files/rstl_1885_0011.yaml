tldr: The author examines the chromatology of Actinia, investigating the pigments
  and coloration in various species. They discover that the coloration in Actinia
  mesembryanthemum closely resembles that of reduced haemoglobin, and they successfully
  extract pigments using glycerin. The author also explores the decomposition products
  of these pigments, finding similarities to those obtainable from haemoglobin.
