revised_title: The Effect of High-Speed Alternating Stresses on the Fatigue of Metals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author develops a high-speed fatigue tester capable of alternating stress
  at a rate of over 7000 per minute, discovering that the endurance of mild steel
  is greater at higher speeds. This opens up a new field of investigation in fatigue
  testing, with implications for reducing testing time and improving understanding
  of material behavior under rapid stress changes.
