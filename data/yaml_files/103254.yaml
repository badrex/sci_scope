revised_title: Investigating the Spontaneous Ascent of Water and its Relation to Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Magnetism
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to explore the spontaneous ascent
  of water and its behavior in various conditions, including in a vacuum. The author
  draws a comparison between the ascent of water and the behavior of magnets, suggesting
  a possible connection between the two phenomena.
