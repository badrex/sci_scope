revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Altitudes Using a Thermometrical Barometer
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author, Francis John Hyde Wollaston, develops a thermometrical barometer
  for measuring altitudes with greater accuracy and convenience than previous methods.
  The instrument is sensitive to changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature,
  allowing for precise measurements. Wollaston describes the construction and use
  of the barometer, as well as experiments conducted to test its accuracy.
