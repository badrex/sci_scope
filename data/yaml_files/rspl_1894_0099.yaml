scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author presents a method for determining the thermal conductivity of metals,
  specifically copper, silver, gold, and platinum, using a simple and efficient experimental
  setup. The method involves measuring the rise in temperature of the metal wire ends
  and calculating the flow of heat, allowing for accurate conductivity values to be
  obtained.
