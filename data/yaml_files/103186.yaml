revised_title: An Experiment on the Proportions of the Ascent of Spirit of Wine between
  Two Glass Planes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, conducts an experiment to determine the relationship
  between the distance between two glass planes and the height of the spirit of wine
  between them. He finds that the height of the wine increases as the distance between
  the planes decreases, suggesting a connection between surface tension and capillary
  action.
