revised_title: Investigating Lateral Explosion and Electricity in Discharges
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: Joseph Priestley investigates the lateral explosion and electricity communicated
  to the electrical circuit during a discharge. He discovers that the lateral spark
  does not communicate electricity as expected, leading to a series of experiments
  to understand this phenomenon.
