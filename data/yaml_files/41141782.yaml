scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal changes in the position of the horizontal
  needle at Port Bowen in 1825, observing that the daily variation is affected by
  the Earth's magnetic axis and external forces. The study aims to determine the direction
  of the needle's daily variation when directed towards different points of the compass
  and to identify the line of no daily variation.
