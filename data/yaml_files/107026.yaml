scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of the acid of borax, also known as
  sedative salt, using oxygenated muriatic acid. Through a series of experiments,
  the author observes changes in the salt's composition and structure, suggesting
  a new understanding of the acid's formation and properties.
