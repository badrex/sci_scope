revised_title: On the Existence of Multiple Proportion in the Quantities of Heat and
  Equivalent Alteration of Internal Space of Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the existence of multiple proportion in the quantities
  of heat and equivalent alteration of internal space of bodies during chemical reactions
  and changes of state. The study involves the oxidation of various substances, and
  the results indicate that the law of multiple proportion exists in these processes.
