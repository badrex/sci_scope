revised_title: Further Experiments on Alternating Diurnal Currents of Electricity
  at the Terrestrial Surface
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author conducts additional experiments to determine the direction of daily
  electrical currents and their correlation with the motion of a horizontal magnetic
  needle and telegraph. While the general character of deflections is similar, there
  is no clear simultaneous coincidence in their movements.
