revised_title: Experimental Investigation of Plane Waves Propagation Velocities in
  Biaxal Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Crystal Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the velocities of normal propagation of plane waves
  in a biaxal crystal and compare the results with Fresnel's and Lord Rayleigh's theories.
  They find that the experimental values deviate from the theoretical predictions,
  with the difference increasing as the angle of incidence increases.

- Wave Propagation
