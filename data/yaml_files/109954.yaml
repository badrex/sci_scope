tldr: 'Sir Everard Home presents observations on the human urethra''s internal structure
  made by F. Bauer. The urethra is composed of two parts: an internal membrane and
  an external muscular layer. This finding refutes the common belief that the lining
  of the urethra consists of circular contractile fibers. The study also sheds light
  on the causes of stricture, a condition involving either spasmodic or permanent
  contraction of the urethra.'
