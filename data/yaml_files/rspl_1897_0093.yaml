scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproduction & Development
tldr: The author investigates the effects of a uterine foster-mother on the development
  and breed of fertilized ova and offspring in rabbits. The experiments show that
  a uterine foster-mother has no power to modify the breed of her foster-children
  and that her uterus during gestation is analogous to a bed of soil providing nourishment
  to the embryo.
