  Human Vision
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neuroanatomy
tldr: The author investigates the semi-decussation of the optic nerves and proposes
  a new arrangement of the optic nerves that better explains the visual pathways in
  humans. This new arrangement is supported by evidence from comparative anatomy in
  fish and a case study of a friend with a visual disorder.
