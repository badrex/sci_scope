scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This article investigates the absorption and radiation of heat by gaseous matter,
  focusing on the effects of chemical combination and the use of a thermo-electric
  pile. The author examines various gases and vapors, finding that compound gases
  have a higher absorptive power than elementary gases. The study also explores dynamic
  heating, chilling, and radiation, as well as the potential for determining the temperature
  of space through direct experimentation.
