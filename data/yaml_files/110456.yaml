scientific_subdiscipline: Astrodynamics & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: J. W. Lubbock recalculates the elements of Halley's comet orbit, accounting
  for the semi-axis major, planetary actions, and precession effects. He corrects
  erroneous statements regarding the perihelion passage and distinguishes it from
  the actual appearance to Earth spectators.
