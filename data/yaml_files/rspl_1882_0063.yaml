revised_title: Determination of the Absolute Value of the British Association Unit
  of Resistance and the Pitch of a Standard Tuning-Fork
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using Lorentz's method to determine the absolute
  value of the British Association unit of resistance and the pitch of a standard
  tuning-fork. They find that the mean value of the B.A. unit is 986 x 10^9 C.G.S.,
  and they also establish the absolute pitch of a specific tuning-fork used as a time
  standard in their work.
