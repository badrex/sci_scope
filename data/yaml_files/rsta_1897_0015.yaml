revised_title: Heat Transmission Between Metal Surfaces and Liquids in Contact
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the rate of heat transmission between metal surfaces
  and liquids in contact, focusing on the effect of fluid velocity on heat transfer.
  They develop an experimental setup to study heat transfer in pipes and validate
  the theory of heat transfer under varying conditions.
topics:
- Heat Transfer
- Thermal Conductivity
- Fluid Dynamics
- Heat Convection
- Heat Flux
