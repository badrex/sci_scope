revised_title: Investigating the Irritability of Nerves and Their Contractile Properties
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the irritability of nerves and their contractile properties
  through various experiments, including nerve division, retraction, and electrical
  stimulation. The results suggest that nerves can contract independently of the brain
  and surrounding tissues, and that electrical stimulation does not increase this
  contraction. The author also discusses cases of nerve-related disorders, such as
  tic douloureux and locked jaw, to further illustrate the findings.
