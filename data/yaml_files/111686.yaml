scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author discusses quaternary cubics using a canonical form and demonstrates
  how to form contravariants and invariants with a supernumerary variable. He also
  explores the relationships between the theory of quaternary cubics and binary quintics,
  as well as the geometric representation of covariants and surfaces.
