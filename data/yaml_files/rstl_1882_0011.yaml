revised_title: A Revised Theory of Gunpowder Combustion
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author presents a new theory explaining the chemical reactions that occur
  during gunpowder combustion, including the composition of the products and the influence
  of different powder types. The theory challenges previous assumptions about the
  complexity of gunpowder metamorphosis and provides a more comprehensive understanding
  of the chemical processes involved.
