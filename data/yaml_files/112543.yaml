revised_title: Combustion of Hydrogen and Carbonic Oxide in Oxygen under High Pressure
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Combustion
tldr: Frankland's experiments on the combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in
  oxygen under high pressure led him to question the commonly accepted theory that
  the light of gas flames is due to the presence of phosphorus or other similar substances.
  He found that the illuminating power of a coal-gas flame is directly proportional
  to the pressure of the gas, and that the luminous agent in a gas flame is not phosphorus
  but a product of the combustion of hydrogen and carbon.
