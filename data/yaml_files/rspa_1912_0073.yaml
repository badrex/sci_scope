revised_title: Investigating Apparent Changes in Weight During Chemical Reactions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Techniques
tldr: This study examines the causes of apparent changes in the total mass of chemically
  reacting substances and discusses the improvements made to balance techniques and
  reaction vessels to increase the accuracy of weight measurements. The authors also
  introduce new devices and precautions to reduce experimental errors and improve
  the limit of weighing.
