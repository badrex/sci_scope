scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Respiration
tldr: James Carson investigates the elasticity of the lungs and their influence on
  the motion of blood. He conducts experiments on animals to measure the force of
  the elastic power in healthy living bodies and discusses methods of artificial respiration
  and determining the air quantity in the lungs after expiration.
