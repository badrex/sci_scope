revised_title: The Liberation of Ions and Oxygen Tension of Tissues during Activity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the liberation of ions and oxygen tension in tissues
  during muscle activity. They measure the ionic changes during tissue activity and
  find that hydrogen ions are liberated during muscular contraction. The study also
  suggests that there must be some oxygen tension in tissues, and a method for measuring
  oxygen tension in tissues is proposed.
