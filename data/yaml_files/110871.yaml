revised_title: Artificial Formation of a Vegeto-Alkali and Furfurol
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: George Fownes describes the artificial formation of a vegeto-alkali, a volatile
  oil called furfural, and its properties. The substance is obtained by distilling
  a mixture of bran, sulfuric acid, and water. Furfural can be converted into a solid,
  yellowish-white substance called furfuroamide, and another substance called furine,
  which has properties of a vegeto-alkali and forms saline compounds with various
  acids.
