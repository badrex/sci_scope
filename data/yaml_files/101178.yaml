revised_title: Correcting Solar Numbers and Refractions in Astronomical Observations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: In two letters to Mr. Collins, Mr. Flamsteed discusses his improvements to an
  instrument for measuring the Moon's true place and his efforts to correct the solar
  numbers in Signor Cassini's tables. He also presents an expedient for testing the
  accuracy of the refractions in these tables, ultimately finding them to be just
  measures.
