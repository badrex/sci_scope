tldr: This article examines the healing mechanisms in plants, specifically the processes
  of primary and secondary adhesion, and compares them to healing mechanisms in animal
  pathology. The author discusses the role of cork formation, the coalescence of living
  cork-cells, and the involvement of indifferent perenchyma in plant healing.
