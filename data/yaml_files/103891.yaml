revised_title: Statical Experiments on the Pressure of Props
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine the pressure sustained
  by props when supporting heavy bodies. The experiments involve varying the length
  of the prop, the angle it makes with the beam, and the distance from the center
  of motion. The results are analyzed using geometrical constructions and algebraic
  expressions, providing insights into the maximum pressure and the nature of curves
  of the third order.
