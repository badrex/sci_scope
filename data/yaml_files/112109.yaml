revised_title: Anatomical Study of Commissures in Marsupial and Monotreme Brains
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the commissures of the cerebral hemispheres in Marsupialia
  and Monotremata, comparing them to those of placental mammals. The study reveals
  significant differences in the arrangement of the folding of the inner wall of the
  cerebral hemisphere, the development of the transverse commissural fibers, and the
  size of the anterior commissure. These differences suggest that the brains of marsupials
  and monotremes have distinct evolutionary characteristics compared to placental
  mammals.
