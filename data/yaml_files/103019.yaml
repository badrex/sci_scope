tldr: The author presents a series of experiments and case studies to challenge the
  prevailing theories on drowning and the presence of water in the lungs and stomach.
  Through dissections and observations, the author demonstrates that a person can
  drown without water being found in their lungs or stomach, and that other factors,
  such as alcohol consumption and suffocation, play a role in drowning.
