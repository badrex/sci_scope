revised_title: The Inheritance of Invisible Characters in Peas
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Plant Breeding
tldr: The author investigates the inheritance of color characters in peas, specifically
  the grey color of the testa, and discovers that the presence of certain factors
  can be latent, meaning they are not visible without breeding tests. This research
  supports Mendel's law of inheritance and provides insight into the genetic basis
  of plant traits.
