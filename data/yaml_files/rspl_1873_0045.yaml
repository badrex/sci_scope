revised_title: Studies on the Origin of Bacteria and Toruloid Vegetations
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The author investigates the mode of origin of bacteria and toruloid vegetations,
  concluding that they primarily originate from invisible germs in the surrounding
  air and water. The study supports the panspermic theory, but the author suggests
  that abiogenesis may occur under rare conditions.
