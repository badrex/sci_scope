revised_title: Comparing Short-Period Inequalities in Sun-Spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature
  Ranges
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate Science
tldr: The authors investigate the correlation between short-period inequalities in
  sun-spot areas and diurnal temperature ranges at Toronto and Kew. They find a strong
  connection between these phenomena, suggesting that solar variations may also be
  connected to terrestrial meteorology.
