revised_title: Investigating the Forces Behind Magnetic Disturbances
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author examines the forces responsible for large magnetic disturbances,
  analyzing the effects of these disturbances on the earth's magnetic force at Kew.
  They argue that smaller disturbances, with periods of a few minutes, are not caused
  by earth-currents, and propose that peaks and hollows in the magnetograph curves
  represent rapid changes in the intensity of the whole disturbing force acting on
  the magnet.
