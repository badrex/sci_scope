revised_title: The Heating Effect of Currents in Precise Measurements of Electrical
  Resistance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors investigate the heating effect of currents in precise measurements
  of electrical resistance and develop a method to calculate the rise of temperature
  due to the heating effect using the temperature coefficient of resistance and thermal
  emissivity. They also determine the validity of equation (4) for predicting the
  change of resistance with temperature.
topics:
- Electrical Resistance
- Heating Effect
- Temperature Coefficient
- Thermal Emissivity
- Resistance Wire
