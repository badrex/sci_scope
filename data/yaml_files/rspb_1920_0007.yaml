revised_title: A Further Study of Chromosome Dimensions in Spermatogenetic Mitoses
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates chromosome dimensions in spermatogenetic mitoses of
  various animals and finds that the third and modified fourth generalizations regarding
  chromosome dimensions and somatic complexity are not supported by the evidence.
  The study provides new insights into the relationship between chromosome dimensions
  and evolutionary development.

- Chromosome dimensions
- Spermatogenetic mitoses
