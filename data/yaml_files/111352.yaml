  the Factors Affecting Strength and Design'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson's experiments on cast iron pillars reveal the effects of pillar
  shape, iron type, and length on their breaking weight. He also investigates the
  differences in crushing strength between the center and outer parts of the pillars,
  leading to adjustments in the formulae for calculating their strength.
