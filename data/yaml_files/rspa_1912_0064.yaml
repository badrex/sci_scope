revised_title: Influence of Sodium Hyposulphite on the Absorption Spectra of Didymium
  Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the effect of sodium hyposulphite on the absorption
  spectra of didymium salts and finds that it causes a significant change in the band
  near D, increasing its breadth and intensity. This change is not observed with other
  reducing agents, suggesting that the effect is due to the acidic nature of sodium
  hyposulphite.
