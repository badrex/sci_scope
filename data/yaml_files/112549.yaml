revised_title: Anatomy of the Blood-Vessel System in Hedgehog Retina
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This study examines the unique blood-vessel system of the hedgehog's retina,
  which is a link between non-vascular and vascular retinas in different species.
  The arteries and veins lie on the inner surface of the retina, while capillaries
  only traverse the limitans and penetrate the inner layers.
