revised_title: Correction of Solar Tables Based on Mr. South's Observations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: G. B. Airy investigates discrepancies in solar tables and concludes that they
  primarily arise from errors in the epoch and the place of the perigee. He suggests
  correcting the solar tables by increasing the epochs of the sun by 9" and the epochs
  of the perigee by 1'48".
