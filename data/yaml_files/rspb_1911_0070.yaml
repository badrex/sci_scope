revised_title: The Hormonal Regulation of Osmotic Effects in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the role of hormones in osmotic effects in plants, specifically
  the translocation of nutritive materials. They find that differential septa in plants
  are permeable only to substances with low water affinity, and that hydrogen cyanide
  affects these septa, raising questions about the regulation of metabolism and translocation
  of nutrients.
topics:
- Plant Hormones
- Osmotic Pressure
- Differential Septa
- Nutritive Materials Translocation
- Hydrogen Cyanide Effects
