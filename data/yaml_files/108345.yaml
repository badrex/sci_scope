tldr: The author, Francis Ronalds, invents a system of self-registering photographic
  instruments to measure meteorological and magnetical phenomena. The system uses
  a microscope, fine lenses, and a photo-electrograph to capture and record changes
  in atmospheric electrometer, thermometer, barometer, and magnetometer. This method
  allows for accurate and efficient monitoring of various weather and magnetic conditions.
