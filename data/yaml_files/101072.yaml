revised_title: Incombustible Skin, Paper, and Candle Week from a Substance Found in
  Italian Mines
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: A substance found in Italian mines can be transformed into an incombustible
  material resembling skin, paper, and a candle that burns for a week. This material
  resists fire, water, and air, making it a potential candidate for creating an 'everlasting'
  book called the 'Book of Eternity.' Further experiments are planned to explore its
  potential uses.
