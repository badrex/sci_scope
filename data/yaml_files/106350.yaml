revised_title: Chemical Analysis of Lead Ore and Its Impurities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author examines the properties and impurities of lead ore, including its
  specific gravity and the effects of various dressings. He also investigates the
  formation of lead and the role of impurities in the smelting process, concluding
  that the process is not entirely efficient and that further research is needed to
  improve the extraction of lead from its ores.
