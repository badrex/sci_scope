scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomical History & Observations
tldr: The author investigates the historical solar eclipse said to have been predicted
  by Thales, using updated astronomical data and calculations. They find that the
  eclipse of 610 BC is the most likely candidate, passing over the north-eastern part
  of Asia Minor, and suggest that discrepancies in historical records may be due to
  a lack of authentic documents at the time of writing.
