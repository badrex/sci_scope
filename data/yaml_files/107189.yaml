revised_title: On the Application of a Method of Differences to Series Whose Sums
  are Obtained by Mr. Landen
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: The author, Benjamin Gompertz, presents a method of differences for summing
  series whose sums are obtained using Mr. Landen's techniques. The method involves
  applying mathematical lemmas and manipulating trigonometric functions to derive
  new series and find the desired sums.
topics:
- Series summation
- Differential calculus
- Mathematical analysis
- Landen's method
- Infinite series
