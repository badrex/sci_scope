revised_title: 'On the Constitution of the Solid Crust of the Earth: A Hypothesis
  of Unequal Contraction'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author proposes a hypothesis that the variations in the Earth's surface,
  such as mountains and ocean beds, are a result of unequal contraction of the Earth's
  mass from a fluid to a solid state. This hypothesis explains the density differences
  beneath mountain regions and ocean beds, as well as the deflection of the plumb-line
  in India.
