revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Ice and Other Bodies Existing in the Solid
  State at Temperatures Above Their Ordinary Melting Points
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The author presents experiments demonstrating that ice and mercuric chloride
  can exist in the solid state at temperatures far above their ordinary melting points.
  The findings challenge the understanding of phase transitions and the behavior of
  materials under extreme conditions.

- Low Temperature Physics
- Phase Transitions
