revised_title: On Stokes's Current Function and Its Applications in Fluid Dynamics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author investigates Stokes's Current Function and its applications in fluid
  dynamics, particularly in irrotational motion and extended doublets. The study focuses
  on the mathematical representation and properties of the function, as well as its
  relation to velocity potential and fluid motion symmetry.
