revised_title: Investigation of Anthocyanins and Anthocyanidins Production
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the production of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins through
  the reduction of flavonol derivatives and their glucosides. The findings support
  the conclusion that these red pigments are true anthocyanins and anthocyanidins,
  contributing to the understanding of plant pigments and metabolism.
