revised_title: 'Phosphoric Acid in Igneous Rocks: An Analysis by George Fownes'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Soil Science
tldr: George Fownes investigates the presence of phosphoric acid in various igneous
  rocks, including Dartmoor porcelain clay, lava from the Rhine, trachyte from the
  Drachenfels, and more. He finds phosphoric acid to be a common component in volcanic
  rocks and suggests it as a primary source of the fertility in soils derived from
  their disintegration.
