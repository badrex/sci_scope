revised_title: Spectroscopic Quantitative Analysis of Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors, J. Norman Lockyer and William Chandler Roberts, explore the use
  of the spectroscope for quantitative analysis of certain alloys. They describe their
  experiments with alloys of zinc and cadmium, as well as the gold-copper alloy used
  in coinage. By comparing the spectroscope readings with the results of traditional
  assays, they demonstrate the potential for significant time savings in determining
  the value of gold bullion.
