revised_title: Investigating Descending Impulses in the Spinal Cord
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of descending impulses in the spinal cord
  and their distribution, observing a marked quantitative diminution of impulses leaving
  the spinal cord and localizing direct transmission in the posterior column. The
  study highlights the unilateral representation of function in the central nervous
  system and the physiological characteristics of nerve center regions.
