scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the electric effect of rotating a dielectric in a magnetic
  field, confirming the predictions of electromagnetic theory by Lorentz and Larmor.
  The experiment demonstrates that a radial electric displacement is produced in a
  dielectric when it rotates in a magnetic field, and the amount of displacement agrees
  with theoretical calculations.
