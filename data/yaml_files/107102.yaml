scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Drug Preparation
tldr: The author investigates the preparation methods of Dr. James's Powder and proposes
  a new method using the 'humid way' to create a more homogeneous and consistent substance.
  The new method involves dissolving equal parts of white oxide of antimony and phosphate
  of lime in muriatic acid, then pouring the solution into an alkaline liquid. This
  new preparation is more soluble in acids and has a more uniform composition than
  the traditional dry method.
