revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Bitumen from Vegetable Substances
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines the transformation of vegetable substances into bitumen,
  providing evidence that bitumen is derived from the organized kingdoms of nature,
  particularly from vegetable bodies. The study focuses on the Bovey Coal found in
  Devon, which exhibits a series of gradations from lignite to bituminous coal, offering
  insights into the process of carbonization and bitumen formation.
