revised_title: The Leakage and Evolution of Helium from Radioactive Minerals
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the leakage of helium from radioactive minerals, such
  as monazite and thorianite, and discovers that the rate of helium evolution far
  exceeds the rate of generation by radioactive change. This suggests that the conditions
  deep within the Earth are more favorable for retaining helium, allowing for the
  accumulation of helium in these minerals over time.
