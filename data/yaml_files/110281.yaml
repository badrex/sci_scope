revised_title: Magnetic Deviations for Determining Thickness of Solid Substances
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geology
tldr: The author, William Scoresby, explores the use of magnetic deviations to determine
  the thickness of solid substances that are difficult to measure otherwise. He conducts
  experiments with magnets and compasses, finding that the method can be highly advantageous
  in mining operations and engineering. The author also discusses the practical applications
  of this method in various situations where direct measurement is not possible.
