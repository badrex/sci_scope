revised_title: The Role of Lymphatics in Bile Pigment and Bile Acid Transport
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pathology & Internal Medicine
tldr: The author investigates the role of lymphatics in bile pigment and bile acid
  transport in the liver. They find that bile can only reach the blood through the
  intervention of the lymphatics, suggesting that bile pigment and bile acid cannot
  pass through the endothelium of blood capillaries in the liver or throughout the
  body.
