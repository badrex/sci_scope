revised_title: Spectroscopic Observations of Nebulae and Clusters
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy
tldr: The author, William Huggins, continues his observations on the spectra of nebulae
  and clusters, confirming that they give either a continuous spectrum or a spectrum
  with one, two, or three bright lines. He also describes a method to estimate the
  intrinsic brightness of some nebulae, finding that their light intensity is too
  small to account for the unknown corrections for the loss sustained in their passage
  through space and the Earth's atmosphere.
