revised_title: Investigation of Atmospheric Electrical Variations at Sunrise and Sunset
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: This study investigates the changes in atmospheric electrical variations at
  sunrise and sunset using various instruments, including the Wilson compensating
  gold-leaf electroscope and Ebert electrometers. The results show a marked decrease
  in all electrical quantities after sunset, with the solar effect being more pronounced
  at sunset than at sunrise.
