revised_title: Magnetic and Dia-Magnetic Phenomena in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author, William Sykes Ward, investigates the magnetic and dia-magnetic properties
  of various metals under the influence of magnetic force. He observes that the nature
  and direction of the action on metals vary with the intensity of the magnetic force.
  The author also describes phenomena related to the magnetic and dia-magnetic states
  of metals and makes assumptions to explain these phenomena.
