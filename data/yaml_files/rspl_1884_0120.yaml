revised_title: 'Regional Metamorphism: A New Perspective on Metamorphic Action'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author proposes a new theory of regional metamorphism, suggesting that physical
  causes such as heat produced by the mechanical work of compression or crushing of
  the Earth's crust can cause significant changes in rocks. This theory explains the
  alteration of rocks in mountain ranges and challenges the traditional understanding
  of contact and normal metamorphism.
