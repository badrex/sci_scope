  to the Nervous System'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: Victor Horsley and Edward Albert Sch√§fer investigate the functions of the marginal
  convolution in the cerebral cortex and its connection to the nervous system. They
  explore the mesial surface of the hemisphere and discover that stimulating specific
  areas of the marginal convolution can cause coordinated movements in the trunk and
  limbs. Their research contributes to the understanding of the localization of functions
  within the brain.
