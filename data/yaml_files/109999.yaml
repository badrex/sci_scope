revised_title: Investigating Electrical Phenomena in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy examines electrical phenomena in a vacuum, exploring the relationship
  between electricity, heat, light, and magnetism. He discovers that the light and
  heat generated in electrical experiments depend primarily on properties or substances
  in the matter through which they pass.
