  and Atmospheric Absorption'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the transmission of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere,
  examining the absorption of sunlight by different thicknesses of atmosphere and
  the effect of altitude on light intensity. The study uses a combination of visual
  and photographic observations to determine the relationship between atmospheric
  absorption and the scattering of light.
