revised_title: On the Prolongation and Control of Stratified Discharges Using Condensers
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author describes an instrumental arrangement using condensers to produce
  and control steady stratified discharges. By charging a condenser with an induction
  coil, the author can maintain a steady stratified discharge for extended periods,
  allowing for the study of its various phases.
