revised_title: On the Nucleation of Crystallization in Supersaturated Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the process of crystallization in supersaturated saline
  solutions, specifically focusing on the role of normal salt crystals as nuclei to
  initiate crystallization. They demonstrate that chemically clean crystals of the
  normal salt are highly effective in inducing crystallization in supersaturated solutions.
