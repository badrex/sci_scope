  Ultra-Violet Light, and Point Discharges

tldr: This paper investigates the diffusion of ions in air produced by radioactive
  substances, ultra-violet light, and point discharges. The author calculates the
  coefficients of diffusion from observations on the loss of conductivity of a gas
  as it passes through metal tubing. The results show that the rate of diffusion of
  ions into a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas.
