revised_title: Applications of Dynamical Principles to Physical Phenomena and a New
  Constituent of the Blood
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Blood Chemistry
tldr: The author explores the applications of dynamical principles, specifically Lagrange's
  equations, to various physical phenomena, including the electromagnetic field and
  the potential energy of a system. Additionally, the author discusses a new constituent
  of the blood that gives rise to fibrin ferment and its physiological implications.
topics:
- Dynamical Principles
- Lagrange's Equations
- Electromagnetic Field
- Gyroscopic Systems
- Blood Constituents
