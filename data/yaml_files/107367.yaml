  of a New Gas
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Acid-Base Chemistry
tldr: The author examines the effects of acids on hyperoxymuriates and discovers a
  new gas with unique properties. The gas, which contains four proportions of oxygen,
  is not an acid and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of acidity
  and chemical compounds.
