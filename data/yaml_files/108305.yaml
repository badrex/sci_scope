scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Faraday investigates the magnetic properties of various metals and their compounds,
  discovering that they retain a magnetic power even when heated, and that the transition
  from one degree of magnetic force to another is gradual rather than instantaneous.
