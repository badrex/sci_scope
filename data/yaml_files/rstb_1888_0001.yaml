tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on the functions of the cerebral
  cortex, focusing on the prefrontal, central, occipital, and temporo-sphenoidal regions.
  They used electrical excitation and ablation methods to investigate the effects
  of lesions on the brain and observed the animals' behavior and motor functions.
  The results showed that the anterior part of the frontal lobes did not have significant
  effects on motor functions or sensibility, while other regions played crucial roles
  in various brain functions.
