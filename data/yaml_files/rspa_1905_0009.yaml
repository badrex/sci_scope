scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Radiochemistry & Nuclear Chemistry
tldr: The authors, O. Hahn and Sir William Ramsay, discovered a new radioactive element
  that evolves thorium emanation. The substance is highly active, with 10 milligrams
  being 100,000 times more active than a kilogram of thorium. The researchers are
  still investigating whether the substance is a constant radioactive constituent
  of thorium preparations or a new element.
