revised_title: Experiments on Air Extracted from Different Kinds of Waters
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
tldr: The author, Abbe Fontana, investigates the air extracted from various types
  of water and compares its quality to atmospheric air. The experiments show that
  water absorbs more dephlogisticated air than common air, and the air extracted from
  Seine water is slightly less respirable than distilled water.
