revised_title: Disproving the Alleged Expansion in Volume of Substances During Solidification
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the alleged expansion in volume of various substances,
  such as cast iron and iron furnace-slags, during the process of solidification.
  Through experiments, the author demonstrates that these substances do not expand
  in volume and that their density in the molten state is greater than when solid.
  This finding challenges the theories of Nasmyth and Carpenter regarding lunar volcanic
  action.
