revised_title: On the Effects of Pressure on the Magnetisation of Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt
  and discovers that the critical field for cobalt is significantly higher than that
  for iron. The study also reveals that cobalt exhibits opposite phenomena to iron
  when magnetised, lengthening or shortening depending on the magnetising field strength.
