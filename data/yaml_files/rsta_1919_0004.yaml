revised_title: On the Propagation of Sound in the Free Atmosphere and Acoustic Efficiency
  of Fog-Signal Machinery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound Waves
tldr: This article presents experiments conducted at Father Point, Quebec, to study
  the propagation of sound in the free atmosphere and the acoustic efficiency of fog
  signal machinery. The authors discuss the mathematical theory of sound propagation,
  measurement of sound intensity, and the influence of meteorological conditions on
  sound propagation. They also analyze the efficiency of fog signals and the acoustic
  output of compressed air sirens.
