  Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the correlation between abdominal pores and nephrostomes
  in elasmobranch fishes, finding that these two sets of organs are often present
  in the same species. The study provides a comprehensive account of the distribution
  of both nephrostomes and abdominal pores among adult elasmobranchs, suggesting that
  the body cavity of these fish is never completely enclosed by the peritoneum.
