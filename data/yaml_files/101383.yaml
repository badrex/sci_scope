tldr: This article discusses a debate between Vis-Count Brouncker, Sir Christopher
  Wren, and others regarding the priority of discoveries in geometry, specifically
  the discovery of a straight line equal to a curved line. The authors argue that
  William Neil had discovered this concept in 1657, with others, such as Heuraet and
  Hugens, claiming their own discoveries in the following years.
