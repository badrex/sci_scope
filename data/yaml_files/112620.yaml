revised_title: Investigation of the Thermal Expansion of Metals and Alloys
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the expansion of various metals
  and alloys by heat, and finds that the volume and linear coefficients of expansion
  for alloys are approximately equal to the mean of the component metals' expansion
  coefficients.
