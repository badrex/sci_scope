revised_title: 'The Spectrum of Radium Emanation: Further Experiments and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of radium emanation through various experiments
  and observe a brilliant spectrum consisting of green, blue, and violet lines, as
  well as a slightly refrangible line in the red. They also note that the spectrum
  fades and is replaced by the spectrum of secondary hydrogen. The authors provide
  a table of wave-lengths and intensities of the observed lines and discuss the effects
  of different experimental conditions on the spectrum.
