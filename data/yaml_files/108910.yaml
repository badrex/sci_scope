scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: Professor Cayley presents an extension to his previous work on the resultant
  of a system of two equations, providing tables for equations with numerical coefficients.
  The elimination tables verify the original memoir and demonstrate that the sum of
  the numerical coefficients in each table should vanish.
