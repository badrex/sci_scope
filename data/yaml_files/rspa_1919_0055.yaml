revised_title: 'The Adsorption of Gases at Low and Moderate Concentrations: Theoretical
  Adsorption Isostere and Isotherm'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The authors develop a theoretical adsorption isostere and isotherm for gases
  at low and moderate concentrations. They analyze the adsorption of various gases
  and verify the form of the theoretical isosteres and isotherms through experimental
  data. The study provides insights into the relationship between adsorption and temperature,
  and the applicability of the developed formula to real-world scenarios.
