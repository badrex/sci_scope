scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author describes a luminous appearance in the sky over Dublin, observed
  on January 12, 1719/20. The phenomenon began as long streams of light, which gradually
  formed into various shapes, including a figure resembling a square sheet of light.
  The event's color changed from a bright light to the colors of a rainbow, and it
  eventually dispersed into small, thin light clouds. The author compares the appearance
  to the Aurora Borealis, which had been frequent that winter.
