revised_title: 'Advancements in Achromatic Eye-Pieces: A Solution to the Limitations
  of Huyghenian Eye-Pieces'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, J.B. Reade, presents a solution to the limitations of Huyghenian
  eye-pieces in refracting telescopes by introducing single achromatic lenses. These
  lenses, made by combining a crown-lens and a flint-lens, eliminate internal reflections
  and improve the overall performance of the telescope.
