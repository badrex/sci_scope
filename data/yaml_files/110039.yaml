scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Sensory Systems
tldr: Charles Bell examines the functions of the eye's muscles and nerves, demonstrating
  that the four straight muscles are responsible for voluntary eye movements, while
  the two oblique muscles perform involuntary actions. He also explains how the voluntary
  muscles are associated with the activity of the retina and contribute to our understanding
  of the position and relation of objects in space.
