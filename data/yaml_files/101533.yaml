tldr: The author describes the process of extracting and using the grain of kermes
  for dyeing wool. The grain is gathered from a shrub in Languedock, and the red powder
  is extracted and used as a dye. The process involves spreading the grain on linen,
  turning it to prevent heating, and eventually forming small balls to dry in the
  sun. The resulting dye is used by dyers to color wool.
