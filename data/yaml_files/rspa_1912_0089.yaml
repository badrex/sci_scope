revised_title: Investigation of the Effect of Magnetic Force on the Motion of Negative
  Ions in Gas
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of magnetic force on the motion of negative
  ions in a gas, finding that the deflection increases continuously with the force
  at lower pressures. The results suggest that negative ions can exist in an electronic
  state even at higher pressures, indicating that they are not permanently connected
  to gas molecules during their movement.
