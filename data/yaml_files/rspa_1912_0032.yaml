revised_title: Investigation of Devitrification in Silica Glass and its Gas Leakage
  Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author studies the devitrification of silica glass and its gas leakage properties.
  He finds that a high temperature causes the glass to devitrify and become less airtight,
  allowing gas to leak through. This research has implications for laboratory equipment
  and the use of silica glass in high-temperature environments.
