revised_title: Thermal Expansion of Pure Nickel and Cobalt
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the thermal expansion coefficients of pure nickel and
  cobalt, finding that the mean coefficient of linear expansion for nickel is 0.00001248
  and for cobalt is 0.00001208. The results show a high level of agreement with previous
  research, despite slight differences in values.
