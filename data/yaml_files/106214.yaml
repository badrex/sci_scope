scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Life Processes
tldr: John Hunter conducts experiments on animals and plants to understand their ability
  to generate heat and resist cold. He finds that animals can resist extreme cold
  by generating heat internally, while plants can be frozen and lose their ability
  to grow when thawed.
