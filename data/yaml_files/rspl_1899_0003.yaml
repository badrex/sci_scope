revised_title: A Study of a Sugar Bacterium and its Fermentation Capabilities
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The authors investigate a sugar bacterium and its associated yeast, discovering
  that they can induce powerful fermentation in various saccharine liquids, such as
  sugar and water, soda-water, beer wort, milk, and lemon-infused solutions. The fermentation
  is anaerobic and results in the destruction of sugar and the production of large
  quantities of carbon dioxide.
