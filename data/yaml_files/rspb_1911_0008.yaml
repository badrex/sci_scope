  and Significance'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: This study investigates the auto-agglutination of red blood cells in trypanosomiasis
  and its relation to temperature. The researchers demonstrate that temperature plays
  a crucial role in the development of the phenomenon, with agglutination occurring
  more readily at lower temperatures. They also find that the serum of infected animals
  contains auto- and iso-agglutinins, which contribute to the agglutination process.
