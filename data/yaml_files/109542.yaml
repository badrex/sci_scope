  the Crystalline Lens
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ophthalmology & Optometry
tldr: The author discusses the eye's ability to adjust its focus for objects at different
  distances, even when deprived of the crystalline lens. He presents experiments and
  observations supporting his opinion that the adjustment is not dependent on internal
  changes in the lens, and addresses the differing results obtained with various optometers.
