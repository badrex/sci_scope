revised_title: The Origin and Deposition of Loess in River Valleys
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Sedimentation
tldr: The author investigates the origin and deposition of loess in river valleys,
  concluding that it is connected to the fluviatile high and low-level gravels and
  was deposited during floods at different periods of the old Post-pliocene rivers.
  The loess's presence in various levels above the existing valleys indicates the
  magnitude of the floods and their erosive power.
