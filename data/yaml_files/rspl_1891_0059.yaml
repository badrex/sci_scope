revised_title: Observations of Nova Aurigae and Its Unique Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: Dr. and Mrs. Huggins observed the Nova Aurigae and discovered a unique spectrum
  with bright and dark lines indicating significant motion. The hydrogen lines were
  particularly bright, and the spectrum showed a large motion of recession for the
  bright lines and a motion of approach for the absorption lines. This celestial phenomenon
  had not been recorded before, making it a significant observation in the field of
  astronomy.
