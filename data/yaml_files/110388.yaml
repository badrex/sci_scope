tldr: Charles G. B. Daubeny investigates the quantity and quality of gases released
  from the King's Bath thermal spring in Bath. He finds an average of 267 cubic inches
  of gas evolved per minute and suggests that the gas is likely stored in a cavern
  deep below the Earth's surface, heated by past volcanic activity.
