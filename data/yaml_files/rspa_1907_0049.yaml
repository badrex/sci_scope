revised_title: Investigating the Distribution of Blue and Violet Light in the Corona
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Wind
tldr: The author analyzes nine photographs of the corona taken during a solar eclipse
  to study the distribution of blue and violet light. They find that the intensity
  of the corona decreases inversely as the fourth power of the average distance from
  the sun's limb, and discuss the implications for understanding the luminosity of
  the corona.
