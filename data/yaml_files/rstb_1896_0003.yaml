scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: This article examines the microscopic structure and classification of madreporarian
  coral types, focusing on the development of the calcareous skeleton and the relationship
  between soft polyp parts and the hard skeletal structure. The author provides a
  historical overview of previous research and discusses the evolution and classification
  of these corals based on their skeletal structure.
