revised_title: The Absorption of Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
tldr: The author investigates the absorption of carbonic acid by saline solutions,
  specifically focusing on the role of sulfate of magnesia and sulfate of lime. The
  experiments reveal that sea water can retain a significant amount of carbonic acid
  due to the presence of these salts, and that heating the water can disengage the
  carbonic acid more easily.
