revised_title: Explaining the Inability of Hydrogen Gas to Convey Vibrations from
  a Vibrating Body
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: G.G. Stokes investigates the communication of vibration from a vibrating body
  to surrounding gas, specifically focusing on hydrogen. He explains the incapacity
  of hydrogen to receive and convey vibrations from a bell or a vibrating string,
  due to the high velocity of sound propagation in hydrogen gas and its effect on
  the local reciprocating flow of the gas.
