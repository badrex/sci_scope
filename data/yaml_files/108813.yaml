scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Solid State Physics
tldr: The author investigates the dynamical problems of elastic spheroidal shells
  and spheroids of incompressible liquid, presenting a mathematical framework for
  understanding the behavior of these structures under various conditions. The study
  involves the use of differential equations and spherical harmonics to model the
  physical properties of the system.
