revised_title: Investigating the Attraction of the Himalaya Mountains and its Impact
  on the Plumb-Line in India
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author, John Henry Pratt, investigates the impact of the Himalaya Mountains'
  attraction on the plumb-line in India. He calculates the horizontal attraction of
  the earth's crust and demonstrates its effect on the difference of latitude between
  stations. Pratt's findings have implications for understanding the earth's ellipticity
  and the accuracy of astronomical observations.
