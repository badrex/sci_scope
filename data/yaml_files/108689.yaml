scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author investigates the properties of odd numbers and their division into
  four squares, focusing on the relationships between the roots of these squares.
  The study reveals that every odd number can be divided into four squares with two
  equal roots and two roots differing by 1, 2, or other values. The author also introduces
  a new symbol to represent numbers divided into squares with specific root differences.
