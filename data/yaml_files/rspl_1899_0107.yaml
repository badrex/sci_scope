revised_title: 'Inheritance of Non-Quantitative Characters: Application of Theory
  to Coat-Color in Horses and Eye-Color in Humans'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: This study investigates the inheritance of non-quantitative characters, such
  as coat color in horses and eye color in humans, and extends the theory of correlation
  to include these traits. The author finds that coat color follows exclusive inheritance,
  while eye color does not conform to the law of ancestral heredity. The study also
  examines the strength of heredity in various relationships and concludes that women
  come from more variable stock than men.
