revised_title: 'On a New Register Pyrometer for Measuring the Expansion of Solids:
  Part II'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: J. F. Daniell presents a new register pyrometer for measuring the expansion
  of solids, comparing its results with those of Dulong and Petit. He finds a strong
  correlation between his instrument and the expansion of copper, iron, and platina.
  Daniell also discusses the use of the pyrometer in various industries and its importance
  in both practical and theoretical science.
topics:
- Pyrometry
- Thermal Expansion
- Metals
- Temperature Measurement
- Dulong and Petit's Experiments
