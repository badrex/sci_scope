revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Yellow Colouring Matters Accompanying Chlorophyll
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the yellow colouring matters accompanying chlorophyll
  in green leaves and their spectroscopic relations. The study reveals new findings
  about the physical nature of these yellow colouring matters and provides a different
  characterization of chlorophyll. The author also uses spectroscopy in the violet
  and ultraviolet region to determine if the absorption bands in these regions are
  due to chlorophyll or the accompanying yellow colouring matters.
