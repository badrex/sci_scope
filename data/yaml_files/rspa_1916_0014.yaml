revised_title: 'Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past a Curved Boundary: A New Approach
  to Solving Fluid Dynamics Problems'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author presents a new method for solving fluid dynamics problems involving
  curved boundaries, using conformal transformations and the Schwarzian transformation.
  This approach allows for the determination of streamlines, free streamlines, and
  components of resistance in two-dimensional, steady fluid motion.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Aerodynamics
- Streamline Flow
- Conformal Transformations
- Boundary Layer Theory
