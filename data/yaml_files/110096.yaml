scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomical Instruments & Techniques
tldr: The author describes the process of adjusting the transit instrument at the
  Cambridge Observatory and a phenomenon observed during observations, where the line
  of collimation deviated due to the assistant's body affecting the lateral braces.
  The issue was resolved by providing proper apparatus to protect the braces from
  the sun's rays.
