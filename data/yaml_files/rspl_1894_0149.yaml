scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Gas Chemistry
tldr: The authors, Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay, discover a new gas, argon, in
  the atmosphere. They compare the densities of nitrogen extracted from various sources
  and find that nitrogen from chemical compounds is lighter than atmospheric nitrogen.
  This leads to the discovery of argon, a previously unknown constituent of the atmosphere.
