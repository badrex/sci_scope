tldr: The article describes Mr. Samuel Tull's method of castrating fish, which prevents
  their excessive growth and ensures they are always in season. The method involves
  carefully removing the fish's reproductive organs without damaging the intestines,
  and the castrated fish grow larger and are more fat than their non-castrated counterparts.
