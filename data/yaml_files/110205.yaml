tldr: The authors, William Allen and William Hasledine Pepys, extend their previous
  research on human respiration and guinea pigs to study bird respiration. They find
  that pigeons' respiration involves a similar amount of oxygen absorption and carbon
  dioxide production as humans, but with a quicker circulation of blood and increased
  sensitivity to oxygen.

- Bird Respiration
- Oxygen Absorption
- Carbon Dioxide Production
- Gas Exchange in Birds
