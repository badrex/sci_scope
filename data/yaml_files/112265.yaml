revised_title: The Synthesis and Properties of Dimethylamine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis and properties of dimethylamine, a powerful
  alkaline liquid, by examining its reaction with iodide of methyl and ammonia. The
  process involves separating the dimethylamine from a mixture of ammonias using a
  method of separating ethyl-bases. The resulting dimethylamine has a boiling point
  close to trimethylamine and is easily soluble in water, with strong ammoniacal odor.
