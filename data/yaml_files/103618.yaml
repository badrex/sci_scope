revised_title: Investigating the Force of Moving Bodies and the Active Force of Falling
  Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to investigate the force of moving
  bodies and the active force of falling bodies. He demonstrates that the force is
  proportional to mass multiplied by velocity and refutes Polenus' theory that the
  force is proportional to mass multiplied by the square of velocity.
