revised_title: Investigating Immunity to Different Strains of Trypanosome in Nyasaland
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to determine if the Naturally Infected Dog strain
  of trypanosome in Nyasaland provides immunity against other strains. They find that
  it does not protect against the Human, Wild Glossina morsitans, or Zululand strains,
  highlighting the need for further research into immunity against these strains.
