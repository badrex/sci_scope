revised_title: Compressibility of Gases Between One Atmosphere and Half an Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a detailed study of the compressibility of various gases,
  including air, carbonic anhydride, and nitrous oxide, under different pressures.
  The results are used to deduce the relative molecular weights of nitrogen and oxygen,
  with a probable value of N (nitrogen) being 14.008.
