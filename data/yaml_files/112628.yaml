tldr: Lieut.-Colonel Walker reports on the progress of Captain Basevi's pendulum experiments
  and observations in the Trigonometrical Survey of India. Despite facing difficulties
  with the vacuum apparatus and weather conditions, Basevi successfully completed
  sets of observations at various stations. The results will help determine the number
  of vibrations and corrections for temperature and arc, contributing to the understanding
  of the Indian Arc's measurement.
