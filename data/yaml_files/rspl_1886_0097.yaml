tldr: Sir Richard Owen presents additional evidence supporting the classification
  of the extinct marsupial quadruped Thylacoleo Carnifex as a carnivorous beast, based
  on the analysis of a complete lower jawbone. This further confirms the genus Thylacoleo
  and its relationship to other extinct herbivorous marsupials.
