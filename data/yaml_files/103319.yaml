revised_title: 'Investigating the Motion of Water: Simple and Mixed Motion'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of water, both simple and mixed, through
  a series of experiments and mathematical modeling. They derive a rule for determining
  the proportion between the quantities of water discharged by mixed and simple motion,
  which is useful for understanding river flow and water management.
