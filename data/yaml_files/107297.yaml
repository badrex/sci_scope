revised_title: Investigating the Changes in Atmospheric Air and Oxygen Gas During
  Respiration
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Respiration
tldr: The authors use an advanced apparatus to study the changes in atmospheric air
  and oxygen gas during respiration. They find that the expired gas consists of 8.5%
  carbonic acid, 10.5% oxygen, and 79% azote. The results show that the deficiency
  in the lungs after an experiment is mainly due to the difficulty in bringing the
  lungs to the same state before and after the experiment.
