scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author analyzes magnetic observations at the Kew Observatory from 1857 to
  1862, identifying systematic laws in the disturbances of magnetic declination. The
  study reveals distinct and dissimilar laws for easterly and westerly deflections,
  with prevalence at different hours and distinct maxima. The findings contribute
  to understanding the causes and nature of these magnetic phenomena.
