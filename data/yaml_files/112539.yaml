revised_title: A Study of Supersaturated Saline Solutions and the Role of Nuclei in
  Crystallization
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Solutions
tldr: This memoir investigates supersaturated saline solutions, focusing on the role
  of nuclei in inducing crystallization. The author explores the effect of chemical
  purity on the activity of nuclei and the adhesion between the sides of the vessel
  and the solution. The study also examines the influence of temperature on solubility
  and the formation of different hydrates of sodic sulfate.
