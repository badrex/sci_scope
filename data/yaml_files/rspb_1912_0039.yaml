scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Immunology
tldr: The author investigates the morphology and life-history of various spirochets,
  comparing them to flagellate protozoa, bacteria, and cyanophyceae. Based on the
  distinct morphological differences, the author concludes that spirochets should
  not be classified as protozoa but rather as a separate group of organisms.
