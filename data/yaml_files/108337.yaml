revised_title: Decomposition of Water by Heat and Catalytic Actions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Thermochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of water using heat and various substances,
  including platinum, iridium, and osmium alloys, and discusses the role of catalytic
  actions in the process. The findings suggest that heat, rather than the substance
  itself, is the primary force overcoming the affinity of water elements.
