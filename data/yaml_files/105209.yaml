tldr: The author analyzes baptism and burial records from the London Bills of Mortality
  to determine the population growth and decline in London and Westminster from 1704
  to 1753. The study reveals that the population peaked between 1728 and 1743 and
  has since been in decline, with factors such as the number of dissenters, unmarried
  individuals, and the French wars contributing to the changes.
