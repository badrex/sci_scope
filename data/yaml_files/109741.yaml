revised_title: Differences in Crystalline Forms of Carbonate of Lime, Bitter-Spar,
  and Iron-Spar

tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the primitive crystal forms
  of carbonate of lime, bitter-spar, and iron-spar. He finds that the angles of these
  crystals differ, proving that their forms are not the same. This discovery challenges
  the previous classification of these minerals and suggests that their crystalline
  forms depend on their chemical composition.
