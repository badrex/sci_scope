revised_title: The Extreme Thinness of Cutting Edges and the Measurement of Small
  Distances Using Light Interference
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the thickness of a cutting edge using light interference
  and find that the edge can be as thin as 0.00001 inches. They also demonstrate the
  potential for using light interference as a practical unit for measuring small distances.
