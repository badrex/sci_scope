revised_title: Refractivities of Air, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon, Hydrogen, and Helium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Physical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the refractivities of various gases, including air,
  oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, and helium, using an experimental setup. They
  find that the refractivity values obtained indirectly are in close agreement with
  those obtained by direct comparison with air, verifying the assumption that the
  refractive index of a mixture of gases is the sum of the refractivities of its constituents,
  taken in the proportion in which they occur.
