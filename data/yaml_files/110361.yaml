revised_title: Connection Between Azotic Gas and Volcanic Action
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Volcanology & Geochemistry
tldr: Charles Daubeny discusses Dr. John Davy's findings on the remains of a recent
  Mediterranean volcano and suggests that the evolution of azotic gas from thermal
  springs is connected to volcanic action. Daubeny objects to the idea that the gas
  rises due to high temperature and proposes that it originates from the atmosphere,
  with which the volcano communicates.
