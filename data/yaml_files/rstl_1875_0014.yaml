  and Planetary Influence on Earth's Magnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The authors explore the mathematical expression of observations of complex periodical
  phenomena and investigate planetary influence on Earth's magnetism. They develop
  a method to determine the coefficients of the expression for each separate phenomenon
  and discuss the significance of the results in specific inquiries.
