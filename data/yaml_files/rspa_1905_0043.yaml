revised_title: Investigating the Phosphorescent Spectra of SS and Europium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines the phosphorescent spectra of SS and Europium, discovering
  that the strong phosphorescent line in Europium is not identical to the anomalous
  line in SS. The addition of lime to pure Europium causes the line to shift further
  away from the position it occupies in mixtures of Yt, Sm, and Eu.
