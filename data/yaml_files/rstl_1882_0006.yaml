revised_title: Experimental Determination of the Velocity of White and Colored Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors conduct experiments to measure the velocity of white and colored
  light, finding that different colors have varying velocities, with more refrangible
  rays traveling more rapidly. This discovery has implications for the understanding
  of the ether and its properties.
