revised_title: On the Composition of the Compound Sulphuret from Huel Boys and the
  Binary Nature of Chemical Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: James Smithson investigates the composition of the compound sulphuret from Huel
  Boys and challenges the existence of quadruple and triple compounds. He proposes
  that all chemical combinations are binary and provides evidence for his theory using
  the ratios of lead, antimony, and copper sulphates.
