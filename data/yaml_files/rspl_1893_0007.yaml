revised_title: The Influence of Gravity on Bacterium Zopfii's Growth Patterns
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of gravity on the growth patterns of Bacterium
  Zopfii, discovering that it exhibits a symmetrical pinnate growth when exposed to
  gravity and a less marked growth when reversed. They conclude that the organism
  is negatively geotropic and suggest that gravity may play a role in the spiral form
  of bacteria.
