scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: In this paper, Dr. William Herschel examines the changes in the relative positions
  of double stars and investigates the causes of these changes. He uses authentic
  observations of their motions in right ascensions and polar distances, particularly
  for the star Castor. He also reviews the arguments he used in his previous communication
  and discusses the effects of parallax on these changes.
