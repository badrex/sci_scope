revised_title: Investigation of Negative After-Images and Successive Contrast with
  Pure Spectral Colours
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Perception
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of visual fatigue on color perception by
  examining negative after-images and successive contrast with pure spectral colors.
  They find that the intensity of the light used and the reacting light play a significant
  role in the resulting after-images, with some colors being more affected than others.
