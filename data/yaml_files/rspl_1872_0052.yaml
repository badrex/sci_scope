revised_title: Electric Decomposition of Carbonic Oxide and Synthesis of Marsh-gas
  and Formic Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electric decomposition of carbonic oxide gas and
  synthesizes marsh-gas and formic acid. The experiments reveal that when hydrogen
  and carbonic oxide gas are submitted to the action of electricity, a decomposition
  occurs, forming carbonic acid, hydrogen, and marsh-gas. Additionally, the synthesis
  of formic acid is achieved through the reaction of hydrogen and carbonic oxide gases.
