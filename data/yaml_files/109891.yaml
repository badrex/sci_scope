revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of Fixed Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Astrometry
tldr: John Pond, Astronomer Royal, presents a series of observations made using a
  new instrument to investigate the parallax of fixed stars. The observations suggest
  that the parallax of a Cygni is too small to have caused the discordances in previous
  observations.
