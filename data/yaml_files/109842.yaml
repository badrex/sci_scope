  Systems

scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: The author conducts numerous experiments on rabbits and frogs to study the effects
  of stimuli on the nervous and sanguiferous systems. The findings suggest that the
  laws regulating the effects on voluntary and involuntary muscles are different,
  and that mechanical and chemical stimuli have varying impacts on these systems.
