  Steam, Oxides of Nitrogen, and Ammonia

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the refraction and dispersion of various halogens, halogen
  acids, ozone, steam, oxides of nitrogen, and ammonia. They find that the refractivity
  of the compound is less than the sum of the refractivities of the elements in some
  cases, while in others, it is greater. The dispersive power of the compound lies
  between those of its constituents in all cases.
