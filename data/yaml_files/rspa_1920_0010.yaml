revised_title: Electrical Properties of Parallel Cylindrical Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the electrical properties of parallel cylindrical conductors,
  focusing on the distribution of charge, potential, and force. The study provides
  a solution for the case of equal and opposite charges in the conductors and explores
  the potential and force between them, as well as the repulsion and attraction between
  the cylinders.
