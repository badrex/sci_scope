revised_title: 'Reversal of the Spectrum of Cyanogen: Observations and Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, report their observations on the reversal
  of the spectrum of cyanogen. They describe their experiments using an arc of a Siemens
  machine and various nitrogenous compounds, particularly titanic cyanide and borate
  of ammonia. The authors discuss the influence of the stability of these compounds
  on the reversal and the difficulty in producing it at will.
