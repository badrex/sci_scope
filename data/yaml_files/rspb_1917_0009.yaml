  Involved in the Nitrogen Cycle

scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Microbial Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of bacterised peat and its fractions on
  soil organisms involved in the nitrogen cycle. The results show that bacterised
  peat increases the activity of nitrogen-fixing organisms in the soil, suggesting
  that it has properties beyond the effects of soluble humates or physical improvements
  in aeration.
