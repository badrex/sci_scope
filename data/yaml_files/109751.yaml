scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: John Davy's experiments explore the combinations of fluoric acid, including
  silicated fluoric acid gas, subsilicated fluoric acid, and fluoboracic acid. He
  examines their reactions with ammonia and water, as well as their absorption capacities
  and the formation of new compounds.
