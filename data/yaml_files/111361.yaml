revised_title: Optical Properties of Quinine and Cinchonidin Alkaloids and Their Iodo-Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the optical properties of quinine and cinchonidin alkaloids
  and their iodo-compounds. He discovers that quinidin possesses fluorescence, while
  cinchonidin does not. The author also describes the formation and properties of
  various crystal forms of these compounds, including their optical doubly absorbent
  powers.
