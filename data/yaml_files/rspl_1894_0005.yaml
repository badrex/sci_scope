scientific_discipline: Social Sciences & Humanities
scientific_subdiscipline: Demography & Population Studies
tldr: 'The author investigates the relationship between the ages of married couples
  and their offspring''s birth rates using a method of contours or isogens. The study
  reveals two curious laws: one, the sum of the parents'' ages and the birth rate
  is approximately constant, and two, the birth rate can be calculated by adding the
  parents'' ages and subtracting from a constant value. The findings provide insight
  into fertility rates and the factors affecting them.'
