scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the presence of potassium in protagon through spectroscopic
  and gravimetric analysis. The results show that the sample contains less than one-thirtieth
  of the amount of potassium claimed by Dr. Thudichum, questioning the validity of
  his assertion.
