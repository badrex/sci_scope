revised_title: The Mesodermic Origin and Fate of the Mesectoderm in Petromyzon
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the origin and fate of the mesectoderm in Petromyzon,
  a type of lamprey, and concludes that it is derived from the ectoderm rather than
  the medullary cells. The mesectoderm plays a role in the development of the cephalic
  nerves, internal ganglia, and connective tissue in the branchial region.
