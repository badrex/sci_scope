revised_title: Simplifying the Theory of Planetary Perturbations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author proposes a new method for simplifying the study of planetary perturbations
  by focusing on the principles of dynamics and eliminating unnecessary equations.
  This approach leads to a more efficient and concise solution for determining the
  variable elements of a planet's elliptic orbit.
