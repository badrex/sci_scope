revised_title: Investigating the Fermentation Mechanism and Enzyme Action in Yeasts
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the fermentation mechanism and enzyme action in various
  yeasts, focusing on their ability to ferment different hexose sugars. The study
  reveals that all tested yeasts can ferment glucose, mannose, and fructose, but many
  are unable to ferment galactose. This research contributes to understanding the
  correlation between an organism's activity and its constituent enzymes.
