revised_title: Investigation of Electron Collisions with Atmospheric Neon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of electron collisions with atmospheric
  neon using an apparatus that exposes the gas to an electron stream. They observe
  the production of radiation and ionization under varying electric fields and discuss
  the critical velocities for electrons in neon gas.
