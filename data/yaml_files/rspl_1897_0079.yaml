revised_title: 'Occlusion of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Platinum Black: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The authors investigate the heat of occlusion of hydrogen and oxygen in platinum
  black, finding that the heat evolved during the process is partially due to the
  formation of water and partially to the occlusion of oxygen. They also explore the
  possibility that the occlusion of gases may be related to the formation of platinous
  hydrate.
