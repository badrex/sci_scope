revised_title: Mechanical Notation for Representing the Action of Machinery
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Design
tldr: Charles Babbage presents a system of mechanical notation, similar to algebra,
  to represent and analyze the actions of machinery. This method allows for easier
  understanding and tracking of movements within complex machines, saving time and
  improving efficiency in design and construction.
