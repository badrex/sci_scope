scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This study examines the structure and development of bone, focusing on Haversian
  systems, laminae, lacunae, ossified cartilage, and bone growth. The authors demonstrate
  the process of absorption and replacement of bone tissue, the role of lacunae and
  canaliculi, and the presence of ossified cells in joints. They also discuss the
  growth of bone in cartilage and the role of design in bone structure.
