  Experiment

scientific_subdiscipline: Experimental Physics & Mechanics
tldr: The author presents an alternative experiment to Foucault's pendulum, demonstrating
  the rotation of the Earth using a semicircular arch and a vibrating wire. The experiment
  shows that the plane of oscillation remains at rest with respect to the vertical
  component of the Earth's axis of rotation, confirming the phenomenon observed by
  Foucault.
