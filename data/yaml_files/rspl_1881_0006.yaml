revised_title: Molecular Torsion and Permanent Strain in Conducting Wires due to Electric
  Current
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author investigates the effect of electric currents on conducting wires,
  particularly iron wires, and discovers that the passage of an electric current causes
  a permanent twist in the wire's molecular structure, which can be measured using
  an electromagnetic induction balance.
