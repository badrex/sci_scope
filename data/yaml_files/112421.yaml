scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Gastroenterology & Digestive System
tldr: The author investigates the source of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric
  juice and concludes that it is secreted from the blood corpuscles under pressure
  in the stomach's capillaries. The acid, along with acid phosphates and chlorides,
  passes through the gastric tubules and into the stomach, contributing to the formation
  of gastric juice.
