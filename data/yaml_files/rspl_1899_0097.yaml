revised_title: On the Specific Heat of Metals and the Relation of Specific Heat to
  Atomic Weight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This paper investigates the specific heat of metals cobalt and nickel and examines
  the relationship between specific heat and atomic weight. The experiments reveal
  that the mean specific heat of cobalt is 0.0303, while the mean specific heat of
  nickel is 0.0842. The results also show that the products of specific heat and atomic
  weight for these metals do not remain constant, challenging the applicability of
  Dulong and Petit's law at all temperatures.
