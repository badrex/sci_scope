revised_title: Determination of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: Joule's experiments demonstrate that the mechanical equivalent of heat is the
  amount of mechanical force required to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
  This discovery supports the idea that heat is a form of energy and contributes to
  the development of the law of conservation of energy.
