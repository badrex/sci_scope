revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Small Electrostatic Capacities Using an
  Air Leyden
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The author presents a new form of air Leyden jar that can be used to measure
  small electrostatic capacities, such as those of short lengths of cable. The instrument
  consists of two mutually insulated metallic pieces, which are composed of parallel
  plates. The author explains its use in conjunction with an idiostatic electrometer
  for the direct measurement of the capacity of insulated conductors.
