tldr: This paper explores the properties of cubic curves, focusing on their inflexions,
  Hessians, and Cayleyans. The author presents constructions for these curves and
  demonstrates how their relative positions change when varying the original cubic.
  Special cases, such as equianharmonic cubics, are also discussed, revealing their
  unique properties and relationships to the other curves.
