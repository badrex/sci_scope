revised_title: 'The Absorption Spectra of Benzene and its Homologues: A Study of Temperature
  and Pressure Effects'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectra of benzene and its homologues
  at varying temperatures and pressures. The author examines the effects of these
  changes on the absorption bands and provides a detailed analysis of the experimental
  setup and results. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the behavior
  of aromatic hydrocarbons in different conditions.
