revised_title: 'Central Motor Innervation of the Larynx: Excitation Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the central motor innervation of the larynx through
  excitation experiments, discovering that phonatory movements are more represented
  in the cortex cerebri, while respiratory laryngeal movements are more represented
  in the bulb. They also discuss the representation of adduction and abduction movements
  in the central nervous system.
