tldr: John Bartram describes two types of clay wasp nests found in Pennsylvania, built
  by different species of wasps. The nests are constructed using a unique method,
  and the wasps provide live spiders as food for their offspring. The nests' structure
  and the wasps' behavior are compared to similar species in Europe.
