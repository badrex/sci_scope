scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Ballistics & Firearms
tldr: The author presents a graphical method for calculating the path of a shell in
  high-angle fire, taking into account the effects of atmospheric conditions and the
  ballistic constants of the projectile. This method reduces the calculation process
  to a set of reproducible curves and graphical constructions, applicable to all trajectories
  and shells.
