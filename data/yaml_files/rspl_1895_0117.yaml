revised_title: Investigating the Rhythmic Contractility of the Spleen and its Response
  to Nerves, Drugs, and Animal Extracts
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the rhythmic contractility of the spleen using a specially
  constructed plethysmograph. They find that the spleen responds to changes in blood
  pressure, respiratory and cardiac activity, and demonstrate its response to nerve
  stimulation, drugs, and animal extracts.
