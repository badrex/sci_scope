revised_title: The Turgidity and Contractility of Plant Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the turgidity and contractility of plant cells, specifically
  in the plant species Prosera and Mimosa. They find that turgidity can be dependent
  on the presence of osmotically active substances in the sap, and that contractility
  is a property possessed by actively living cells in plant tissues. The results have
  significant implications for understanding plant movement and growth.
