  Mechanics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mechanics
tldr: The author develops a new method for proving and extending formulae in analytical
  mechanics using differential coefficients and determinants of lines. This method
  provides a clear interpretation of the equations and can be applied to motion in
  one plane and three-dimensional space.
topics:
- Differential Coefficients
- Determinants of Lines
- Analytical Mechanics
- Geometry and Mechanics
- Motion in One Plane
