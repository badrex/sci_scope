revised_title: Determination of Verdet's Constant in Absolute Units
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate Verdet's constant, a measure of the rotation of the
  plane of polarization of light passing through a medium under the influence of a
  magnetic field. They develop a new method to determine the constant using a helix
  without an iron core and bisulphide of carbon as the medium, providing more accurate
  results in absolute units.
