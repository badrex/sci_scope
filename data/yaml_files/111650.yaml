revised_title: 'Measurement of Electrostatic Force Produced by a Daniell''s Battery:
  A New Method'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the electrostatic force produced
  by a Daniell's battery using an absolute electrometer. The method involves comparing
  the indications of the tested electrometer with those of a portable apparatus for
  observing atmospheric electricity. The results provide insight into the potential
  differences and electrostatic forces involved in electrical measurements.
