revised_title: The Development of a New Instrument for Measuring Angles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: John Hadley presents a new instrument designed to measure angles accurately,
  even in situations where common instruments may fail due to unsteady objects or
  environmental factors. The instrument relies on the principles of catoptrics and
  can be used for various applications, including astronomy and surveying.
