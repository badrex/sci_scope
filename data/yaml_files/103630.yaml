scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author describes a simple and accurate method for measuring rainfall depth
  using a cylindrical measure and gage. The method is then applied to record rainfall
  data from April 1, 1722, to April 1, 1723, in Widdrington, Northumberland. The results
  show that some summer months were very wet, while some winter months were very dry,
  with the overall rainfall being close to the mean quantity of rain at Upminster,
  Paris, and Lisle.
