tldr: This study investigates the excretion of cholesterol in humans when fed various
  diets. The researchers found that cholesterol is never excreted as such in the feces
  but always in the form of coprosterol. The amount of coprosterol excreted varies
  depending on the type of diet consumed, with higher amounts found in carnivorous
  diets and lower amounts in herbivorous diets.
