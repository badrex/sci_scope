revised_title: Comparative Study of Salt Absorption Rates by Plant Tissue
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the rate of absorption of various salts by plant tissue,
  specifically carrot and potato cells, and finds that the initial rate of absorption
  depends on the mobility of the cation. The total amount absorbed is influenced by
  other factors, such as the position of equilibrium and the toxicity of the salt.
