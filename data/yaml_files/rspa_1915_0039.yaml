revised_title: An Investigation of the Hissing Phenomenon in Water Flowing through
  a Constricted Tube
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The authors study the hissing phenomenon that occurs when water flows through
  a constricted tube, finding that it is due to a true rupture of the stream at the
  point of lowest pressure. They also determine that the temperature at which the
  hissing just occurs follows a specific law, and that the critical velocity of flow
  is always greater than the calculated critical velocity.
