tldr: The author provides a detailed description of the Gymnotus Electricus, or Electrical
  Eel, including its physical characteristics, behavior, and the unique ability to
  generate electric shocks. The fish is found to be amphibious, with lungs and possibly
  branchiae, and can swim forward or backward with equal ease. The Electrical Eel's
  most astonishing property is its ability to deliver an electrical shock to humans
  or other animals through direct touch or a metallic conductor.
