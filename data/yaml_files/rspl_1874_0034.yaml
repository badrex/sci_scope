revised_title: Investigation of White Lines in the Solar Spectrum and their Variations
  with Altitude
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author investigates the white lines in the solar spectrum and observes changes
  in their appearance and visibility at different altitudes. The study suggests that
  atmospheric effects may be responsible for these variations, and proposes a possible
  explanation involving the sun's light passing through Venus's atmosphere.
