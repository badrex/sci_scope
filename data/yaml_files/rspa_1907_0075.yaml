revised_title: Improving Temperature Measurement in Gas Engine Cylinders
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Internal Combustion Engines
tldr: The authors develop a new method for measuring temperature in gas engine cylinders
  using a fine platinum thermometer and a specially designed valve. This method allows
  for more accurate temperature readings under working conditions, providing valuable
  data for engine research and development.
