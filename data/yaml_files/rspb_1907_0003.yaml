revised_title: The Impact of Increased Barometric Pressure on Human Decompression
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of increased barometric pressure on human
  decompression, finding that a slower decompression rate is necessary to avoid the
  formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body. They also question whether the previously
  recommended 20 minutes per atmosphere is a safe allowance.
