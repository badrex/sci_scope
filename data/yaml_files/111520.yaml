scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Nutrition
tldr: The authors conduct an experimental inquiry into the composition of various
  animals fed and slaughtered for human consumption. They analyze the chemical composition
  of carcasses, offal parts, and entire animal bodies, focusing on the relationship
  between mineral matter, nitrogenous compounds, and fat content. The study reveals
  that fattened animals have a higher percentage of dry fat and total dry substance,
  while leaner animals have a higher percentage of nitrogenous substance. The findings
  provide valuable insights into the nutritional and economic aspects of animal-based
  diets.
