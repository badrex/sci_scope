revised_title: Improvement of Magneto-Electric Machines for Increased Power
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering
tldr: The author describes an improvement to magneto-electric machines, using two
  armatures and a modified design to increase power output. This innovation allows
  for greater potential in external applications, such as blasting with Abel's fusees,
  and demonstrates the capability to make three inches of platinum wire incandescent
  with a small, rudimentary machine.
