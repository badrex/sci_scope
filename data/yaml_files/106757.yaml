revised_title: Investigating the Non-Conducting Power of a Perfect Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts a series of electrical experiments to determine the non-conducting
  power of a perfect vacuum. Using a mercury gage, the author demonstrates that a
  vacuum cannot conduct electricity, and explores the effects of air rarefaction on
  the conductivity of the electric fluid.
