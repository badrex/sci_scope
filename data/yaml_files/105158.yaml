tldr: This article presents a case study of a woman with a rare condition causing
  extreme fragility, flexibility, and dissolution of her bones. Despite various treatments,
  her condition worsened, leading to difficulty breathing, a cessation of menstruation,
  and eventual death. An autopsy revealed that all her bones were affected, with the
  lower extremities being more dissolved than the upper extremities. The cause of
  the dissolution remains unclear, as no significant levels of acid or alkali were
  found in the bone samples.
