revised_title: The Influence of Material Properties on Crack Extension in Isotropic
  Substances
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the factors affecting the extension of cracks in isotropic
  materials, such as glass and rubber, and proposes that the further development of
  a crack depends on the material's ability to yield or rupture under stress. The
  study also highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between shear
  and volume extension in determining a material's limits.
