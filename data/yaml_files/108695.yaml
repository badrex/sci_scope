scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author presents a new formula for comparing hyperbolic arcs using Jacobi's
  second theorem, transforming the comparison process to be as simple as that of elliptic
  arcs. The formula has applications in geometrical researches and the tabulation
  of certain functions.
