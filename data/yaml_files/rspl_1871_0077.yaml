revised_title: Reproduction of Diffraction-Gratings Using Photography
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author describes his experiments on reproducing diffraction gratings using
  photography, achieving promising results with the potential to reduce the cost and
  time of grating production. He also explores the use of gelatine-gratings, which
  may surpass the original gratings in brightness and have a higher concentration
  of light in the first spectrum.
