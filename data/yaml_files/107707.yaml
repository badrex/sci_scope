revised_title: On the Equilibrium of a Homogeneous Fluid Mass in Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the conditions necessary for the equilibrium of a rotating
  fluid mass, focusing on the properties of attraction and the role of density in
  maintaining balance. The study provides a foundation for understanding the figure
  of the Earth and is relevant to celestial mechanics.
