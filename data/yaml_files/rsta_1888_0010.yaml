revised_title: On the Induction of Electric Currents in Conducting Shells of Small
  Thickness
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the induction of electric currents in conducting shells
  with small thickness and develop a general theory applicable to surfaces of any
  shape in the presence of an external magnetic field. They also explore the relationship
  between the magnetic potential and the current function in these systems.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Magnetic Fields
- Current Sheets
- Vector Potential
- Magnetic Shells
