revised_title: Improved Solution of a Problem in Physical Astronomy
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Planetary Dynamics
tldr: The author presents an improved method for solving a problem in physical astronomy,
  which involves calculating the perturbations of planetary motions due to mutual
  gravitational attraction. The new method offers faster convergence and is useful
  for computing the perturbations of Earth, Mars, and Venus.
