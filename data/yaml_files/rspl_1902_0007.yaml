scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ecology & Environmental Science
tldr: The author investigates the toxic effects of the Spurge plant (Euphorbia hiberna,
  L.) on salmonoid fishes and discovers that the plant's extract, even in small quantities,
  is almost as fatal to fishes as corrosive sublimate. The study provides insights
  into the chemical composition of the plant and its impact on aquatic ecosystems.
