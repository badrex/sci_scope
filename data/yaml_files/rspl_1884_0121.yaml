scientific_subdiscipline: Ophthalmology & Optometry
tldr: The author investigates the mydriasis (pupil dilation) caused by applying cocaine
  to the eye and explores the effects of various drugs and drug combinations on the
  eye's response. The study finds that atropine and pilocarpine can be combined with
  cocaine to achieve a controlled dilation, useful in eye surgery, while eserine counteracts
  the mydriasis effect.
