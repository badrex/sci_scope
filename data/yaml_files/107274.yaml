revised_title: Investigating Respiration and the Evolution of Azote
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Respiration
tldr: The authors investigate the evolution of azote (nitrogen) during respiration
  using pure oxygen gas. They find that the increase of azote is not uniform throughout
  the experiment, suggesting that a portion of oxygen is exchanged for azote during
  respiration. The authors also estimate the lung capacity and discuss the possibility
  of azote being produced from oxygen or given off from the blood.
