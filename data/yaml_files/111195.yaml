revised_title: Investigations on the Nature of Iron Attraction on Magnet Poles and
  Development of Compass Correction Instruments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author, Julius Roberts, investigates the nature of iron attraction on magnet
  poles and develops new forms of instruments to correct compass errors caused by
  the presence of iron in ships. He creates a compound needle with two bent magnetic
  bars and an astatic bar to determine the amount of deviation due to iron masses.
  The author believes that further experiments and investigations are needed to make
  the instrument simple and accurate for general use.
