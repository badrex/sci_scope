  Surface Area and Specific Gravity'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee investigates the effect of surface area on
  the weighing of bodies in water. He compares a solid brass piece with a thin brass
  foil of the same weight but with a much larger surface area. Contrary to his expectations,
  the difference in weight between the two materials in water is minimal, suggesting
  that other factors, such as chemical reactions, may play a role in the buoyancy
  of objects in a liquid.
