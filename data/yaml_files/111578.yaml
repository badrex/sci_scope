revised_title: 'The Higher Theory of Elliptic Integrals: A New Approach Using Jacobi''s
  Functions'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a new approach to the higher theory of elliptic integrals,
  focusing on Jacobi's functions as the basis for analysis. This method offers a more
  direct and simplified approach to understanding the properties of elliptic integrals,
  with potential applications in algebraic geometry, number theory, and trigonometry.
