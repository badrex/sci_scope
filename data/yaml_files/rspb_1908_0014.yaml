tldr: This study examines the structure and anatomy of Sigillaria scutellata and other
  Eusigillarian stems, providing insights into their classification and relationship
  to other Paleozoic lycopods. The research is based on petrified specimens from the
  Lower Coal Measures of Shore-Littleborough in Lancashire, revealing details of the
  stems' structure, including the presence of a well-marked pith, scalariform tracheides,
