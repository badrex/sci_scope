revised_title: 'Chylous Urine: A Study on the Excretion of Fibrin, Albumen, and Blood-Globules'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates chylous urine, which contains white fatty matter, and
  discovers that it may also contain albumen, fibrin, and healthy blood-globules.
  The study shows that these components are excreted before food intake and during
  rest, debunking the idea that the disease consists of an accumulation of fat in
  the blood. The research suggests that the disease is caused by a change in the kidney
  structure, allowing the excretion of these components when the circulation through
  the kidney is increased.
