tldr: Dr. William Herschel investigates the limits of telescope resolution and the
  nature of spurious diameters in celestial and terrestrial objects. He conducts a
  series of experiments using various objects and techniques to determine the smallest
  angle that can be seen through a telescope and the factors affecting the appearance
  of spurious diameters. His findings contribute to a better understanding of telescope
  performance and the potential for deception in observing celestial and terrestrial
  objects.
