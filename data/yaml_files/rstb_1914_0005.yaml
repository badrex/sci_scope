scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Management
tldr: The authors investigate the soil solution and its role in plant nutrition, finding
  that the soil solution is of constant composition and capable of satisfying plant
  requirements. They conclude that the observed differences in soil fertility are
  mainly due to the varying capacity of soils to maintain water supply to the plant,
  and that the response of crops to fertilizers is not due to an additional supply
  of plant food but rather to their effect on specific plant toxins.
