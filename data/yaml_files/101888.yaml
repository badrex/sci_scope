revised_title: Observations and Experiments on Tree Growth and the Effects of Pruning
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Forestry & Arboriculture
tldr: Thomas Brotherton's experiments on tree growth reveal that cutting the bark
  affects the growth and resilience of trees. Pruning and bark removal can lead to
  increased growth in some areas and decreased growth in others. Trees that have been
  pruned are more susceptible to frost damage, while those with intact bark are more
  resilient.
