revised_title: Investigating Transfer Resistance in Electrolytic Cells
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the resistance of electrolytic cells and discover the
  existence of a transfer resistance at the junction of the electrodes and electrolyte.
  They find that this resistance decreases as the current density increases, suggesting
  that molecular interactions at the interface may be responsible for this phenomenon.
