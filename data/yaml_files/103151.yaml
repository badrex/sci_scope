revised_title: On the Proportion of Mathematical Points and the Contact Points of
  Circles, Spheres, and Planes
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the proportion of mathematical points and contact points
  between circles, spheres, and planes. He demonstrates that the points of contact
  between circles and their tangents are in subduplicate proportion to the diameters
  of the circles, and that the point of contact between a sphere and a plane is infinitely
  greater than that between a circle and a tangent.
