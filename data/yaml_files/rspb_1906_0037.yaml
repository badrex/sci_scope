revised_title: Observations on Cell Communications between Blastomeres
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates cell communications between blastomeres in the development
  of Serpulid Eupomatus eggs. They observe delicate strands of protoplasm connecting
  cells and suggest that these strands may be similar to or identical with the filose
  filaments described by Andrews. The author also proposes that these strands may
  be pseudopodia, playing a role in coordinating the activities of the embryo.
