revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Glass Effluvia on Motion and Attrition
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to study the effects of glass effluvia
  on motion and attrition. He discovers that the effluvia can cause woolen threads
  to point towards the center of a glass, and that they can also create a light when
  a glass is rubbed in the presence of an exhausted glass. The findings suggest that
  the effluvia act like a solid body, emulating its properties.
