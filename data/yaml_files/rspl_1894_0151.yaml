revised_title: 'The Liquefaction and Solidification of Argon: A Study of Its Physical
  Properties'

scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: Dr. K. Olszewski and Professor William Ramsay investigate the liquefaction and
  solidification of argon, discovering its critical pressure, critical temperature,
  boiling point, and melting point. Argon is found to be the fourth easiest to liquefy
  among the so-called 'permanent' gases and has a higher density than oxygen, leading
  to its unique solidifiable properties.
