revised_title: The Physiological Action of Choline and Neurine in General Paralysis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The authors investigate the physiological effects of choline and neurine in
  patients with General Paralysis of the Insane. They find that choline, present in
  the cerebrospinal fluid, lowers arterial blood pressure and is toxic, while neurine,
  a more potent poison, is not present in the fluid. The toxic substance in the cerebrospinal
  fluid is identified as choline, which reaches the blood via the cerebrospinal fluid,
  acting as the brain's lymph.
