scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Differential Equations
tldr: The author presents a method for solving simultaneous partial differential equations,
  focusing on bidifferentials and their applications in finding complete primitives.
  The paper discusses equations of the first and second order with two independent
  variables and one dependent variable, providing examples and extensions of the method.
