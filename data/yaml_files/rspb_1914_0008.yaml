revised_title: Further Experiments in Crossing British Species of Sea-Urchins
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of crossing different species of sea-urchins
  and observes the impact of foreign sperm on egg development. The results show that
  some eggs undergo cytolysis and die, while others produce hybrid larvae with unique
  characteristics. The study highlights the importance of individual idiosyncrasies
  in successful crossbreeding and the role of cytolysis in inhibiting development.
