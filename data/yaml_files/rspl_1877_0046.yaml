tldr: The author critiques Bernard's method of analyzing blood sugar levels and proposes
  a new gravimetric process for more accurate results. The new method involves the
  precipitation of the suboxide and the collection of copper by means of galvanic
  action, providing more precise and reliable measurements of sugar in blood samples.
