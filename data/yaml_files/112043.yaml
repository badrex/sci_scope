  Kew and Nertschinsk
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author compares the notable magnetic disturbances of 1858 and 1859 at Kew
  and Nertschinsk, discussing the progress of investigating the laws and causes of
  these disturbances. The study reveals that these disturbances are periodical phenomena
  governed by solar hours and are likely connected to the general causes of terrestrial
  magnetism.
