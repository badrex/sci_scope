revised_title: The Effect of Malignant New Growths on the Nitrogen Metabolism of Rats
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of malignant new growths on the nitrogen
  metabolism of rats, finding that the nitrogen retention increases rapidly when the
  tumor starts to grow rapidly. The study also shows that less nitrogen is needed
  to build the tumor tissue compared to the somatic tissue of the host, suggesting
  that the tumor may have a different nitrogen requirement.
