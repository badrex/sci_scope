revised_title: On the Theory of Glacier Motion and Regelation
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryosphere
tldr: The author discusses the process of regelation in glaciers, suggesting that
  the gradual conversion of snow into ice is due to the rearrangement of molecules
  and the influence of adjacent blocks. He also explores the sliding of glaciers on
  their beds and the role of temperature in their movement.
