tldr: This article presents research on solar physics, focusing on the positions and
  areas of sunspots observed at Kew during the years 1864, 1865, and 1866, as well
  as the spotted area of the sun's visible disk from 1832 to 1868. The authors compare
  their findings with previous observations by Carrington and the Kew series, assessing
  the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data.
