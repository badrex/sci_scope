revised_title: The Influence of Radiation on Cellular Growth and Ionization
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of radiation on cellular growth and ionization,
  proposing a photoelectric theory to explain the stimulation and inhibition of cell
  growth by X-rays and 7-radiation. The study suggests that the nature of the morbid
  cell may be characterized by less stable molecular systems, making it more susceptible
  to ionization and radiation treatment.
