revised_title: Investigation of Supersaturation and Nuclear Condensation of Organic
  Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: This study investigates the condensation of drops in dust-free air saturated
  with organic vapours and the role of ions and Rontgen rays in the process. The authors
  determine the least expansion required to cause condensation for various organic
  compounds and examine the efficiency of positive and negative ions as condensation
  nuclei.
