scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Physiology
tldr: The author proposes two challenges related to plant growth and opium detection,
  inviting botanists, medical professionals, and philosophers to find solutions within
  a year and a half. The first challenge seeks methods to determine the cohesiveness
  and mobility of plant parts, while the second asks for a sign that can be identified
  through dissection to confirm opium poisoning.
