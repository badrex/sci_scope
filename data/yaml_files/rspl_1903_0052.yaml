revised_title: Investigation of the Discharge of Electricity from Hot Platinum Wires
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the discharge of electricity from hot platinum wires
  and determines that the negative leak is influenced by the nature of the gas surrounding
  the wire. The presence of hydrogen in the wire is found to be a significant factor
  affecting the negative leak, and the results suggest that ionization of the gas
  molecules at the surface of the platinum plays a role in the discharge process.
