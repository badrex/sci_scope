  Systems and Devoid of a Water-Vascular System

scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the development of echinoderm larvae and discovers that
  the formation of two hydrocoele systems can be artificially induced, leading to
  a profound modification of the larval development process. This finding sheds light
  on the complex and remarkable ontogenetic changes in echinoderms, which transform
  from bilaterally symmetrical larvae to radially symmetrical adults.
