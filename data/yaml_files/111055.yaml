revised_title: On the Flexion, Deflexion, and Inflexion of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Lord Brougham, investigates the bending of light rays through flexion,
  deflexion, and inflexion. He presents a series of definitions and propositions,
  supported by experiments, that demonstrate the behavior of light rays when passing
  near bodies and the resulting formation of fringes or images.
