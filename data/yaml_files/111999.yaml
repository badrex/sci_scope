revised_title: 'On the Equations of Rotation of a Solid Body: A New Approach to the
  Fundamental Formulae'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics &amp; Classical Physics
tldr: The author develops a new method for solving the equations of rotation of a
  solid body about a fixed point, using transformations and integrals to find the
  angular velocity components and the motion of the body. This approach provides a
  more general and elegant solution to the problem, expanding on previous work in
  the field.
