scientific_subdiscipline: Navigation & Marine Technology
tldr: The author describes a new method for testing chronometers used in the Mercantile
  Marine, which can efficiently test chronometers in just five weeks. The method involves
  using a hot-air apparatus to simulate various temperatures, allowing shipmasters
  to know the rate of their chronometers in different conditions. This can help improve
  navigation and reduce errors in determining longitude.
