revised_title: Investigating the Reflexion of Polarized Light from Polished Surfaces
  and Transparent Materials
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the reflection of polarized light from various polished
  surfaces and transparent materials, using a new method of observation based on the
  quartz compensator. The study focuses on determining the optical constants and coefficients
  of reflection and refraction for different substances, providing valuable insights
  into the properties of light and materials.
