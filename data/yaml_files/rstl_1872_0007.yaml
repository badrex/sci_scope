revised_title: On the Formation of Primary and Secondary Chlorides from Paraffins
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the formation of primary and secondary chlorides from
  paraffins, specifically hexane, and discovers that a mixture of both types of chlorides
  is formed under various conditions. The study also reveals that the formation of
  higher chlorinated products can be minimized by passing chlorine through the vapor
  of the hydrocarbon.
