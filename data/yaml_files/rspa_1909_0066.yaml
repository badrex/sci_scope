revised_title: Investigating the Mechanism of Absorption Spectra in Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors explore the mechanism behind the absorption spectra of solutions,
  focusing on the diverse ways absorption can occur and the factors that influence
  it. They apply a formula to various solutions and discuss the implications of their
  findings, suggesting that a more general theory may be needed to fully understand
  the phenomenon.
