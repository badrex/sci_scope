revised_title: On the Changes in Dimensions of a Steel Wire when Twisted and Pressure
  of Distortional Waves in Steel
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the changes in dimensions of a steel wire when twisted
  and the pressure of distortional waves in steel. The study reveals that the side
  contraction and elongation are nearly proportional to the square of the radius,
  and the wire's secondary moduli play a significant role in its behavior.
