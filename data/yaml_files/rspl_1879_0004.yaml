scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Glacial Studies
tldr: The author critiques the widely accepted hypothesis by Mr. Jamieson regarding
  the origin of the Parallel Roads of Lochaber, arguing that the proposed glacial
  barriers and the duration of the lakes are difficult to explain. The author also
  questions the existence of vast glaciers and the efficiency of the barriers in containing
  the large bodies of water in the valleys.
