revised_title: Carbon Monoxide Assimilation in Green Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the ability of green plants to assimilate carbon monoxide
  and find that it can replace carbon dioxide as a source of carbon supply. They also
  observe that plants growing in carbon monoxide produce starch, supporting the idea
  that carbon monoxide is directly used by the plant.
