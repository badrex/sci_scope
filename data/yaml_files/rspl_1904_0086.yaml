revised_title: 'A Study of the Yearly Variation of Magnetic Storms and Aurorae: A
  Possible Cause'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetosphere & Space Weather
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the positions of the sun's
  poles and the frequency of magnetic storms and aurorae. They find that the greatest
  effects on Earth occur when the solar polar regions are most inclined towards the
  Earth during equinoxes, suggesting a possible cause for the yearly variation of
  these phenomena.
