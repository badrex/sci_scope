revised_title: 'Paradibromobenzenesulphonates of Rare Earth Elements: A Study of Valency
  Directions in Tervalent Elements'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The authors investigate the crystal structures of paradibromobenzenesulphonates
  of rare earth elements, such as lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, and cerium.
  They find that these salts have different crystal structures depending on the temperature
  and hydration levels, providing insights into the relationship between the elements
  and their valency directions.
