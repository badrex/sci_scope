tldr: Henry Fox Talbot presents a theorem that states if three abscissae of an equilateral
  hyperbola are materially dependent by two assumed equations, the sum of the arcs
  subtended by them is equal to three-quarters of the product of the abscissae or
  differs by a constant quantity. This theorem is not reducible to any other known
  property of the curve.
