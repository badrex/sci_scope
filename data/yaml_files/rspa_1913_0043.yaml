revised_title: Synthesis and Properties of Anhydrides of Aminoacyl Glucosamines
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors describe the synthesis of anhydrides of aminoacyl glucosamines by
  condensing a-bromoacyl haloids with glucosamine hydrochloride and then displacing
  the halogen with an amino-group using cold aqueous ammonia. They discuss the properties
  and behavior of these compounds, comparing them to degradation products of glucoproteins
  and providing insights into their complex structures and importance in organic chemistry.
