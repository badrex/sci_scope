scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the influence of carbon dioxide on isolated nerve and
  its relation to nerve function, finding that carbon dioxide affects the production
  of carbon dioxide in nerve and influences electrotonic currents and excitatory variations.
