revised_title: On the Performance of an Air-Engine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Energy
tldr: The authors investigate the performance of an air-engine, comparing it to a
  steam-engine, and determine the work absorbed and evolved by the engine. They calculate
  the thermal efficiency and the work output per unit of heat applied to the system,
  providing valuable insights into the potential advantages of air-engines over steam-engines.
