revised_title: Enhancing the Focal Length of a Plano-Convex Lens
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author describes a method to increase the focal length of a plano-convex
  lens by interposing different refractive liquids between two glasses. This technique
  can potentially be used to create telescopes with longer focal lengths using smaller
  lenses.
