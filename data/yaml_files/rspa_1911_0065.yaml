revised_title: The Effect of Temperature on the Ductility of Zinc
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the ductility of zinc,
  discovering that it becomes soft at temperatures around 150°C and hard and brittle
  at around 200°C. The study emphasizes the importance of treating zinc wires uniformly
  to obtain consistent results.
