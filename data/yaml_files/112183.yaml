revised_title: Investigation of the Expansion of Water and Mercury
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the coefficients of expansion for
  water and mercury using a method of weighing the substances in water at different
  temperatures. The results show that the expansion of water between 4°C and 100°C
  can be expressed by a formula, and the coefficient of expansion of mercury is closely
  in agreement with Regnault's findings.
