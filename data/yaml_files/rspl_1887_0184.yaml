tldr: The author discusses the importance of studying the processes of individual
  development and the lines of descent in determining the nature of adult animals
  and the evolution of species. They argue that the idea of the tree of life may not
  serve as a satisfactory basis for a system of classification and suggest that the
  difference in origin between Monotremes and higher Mammals should not prevent them
  from being considered true members of the class Mammalia.
