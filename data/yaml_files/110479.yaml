scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: Fran√ßois Paulet presents a complete demonstration of Fermat's Theorem, which
  states that no power beyond the second degree can be resolved into the sum or difference
  of two other powers of the same degree. The theorem has significant implications
  in number theory and algebra.
