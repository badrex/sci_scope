revised_title: Investigating the Density and Expansion of Hydrogenium in Palladium
  Alloys
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the density and expansion of hydrogenium in palladium
  alloys, discovering that the density of hydrogenium is reduced when considering
  the retraction of the palladium wire. The author also observes that the expansion
  of palladium alloys is greater than that of pure palladium.
