revised_title: An Electrically Heated High-Temperature Radiator for Full Radiation
  Measurements
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Thermal Engineering
tldr: The authors describe the construction and operation of an electrically heated
  full radiator for use in radiation measurements. The radiator is made of alumina
  with a cylindrical body and conical ends, wound with platinum strip for heating.
  The authors discuss the challenges faced and solutions implemented in creating a
  uniform temperature enclosure and maintaining it at high temperatures.
