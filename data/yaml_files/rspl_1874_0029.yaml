revised_title: Debunking the Myth of Expansion in Volume of Substances on Solidification
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: The author investigates the alleged expansion in volume of various substances
  when passing from the liquid fusion state to solidification. Through experiments,
  the author disproves the expansion claim for cast iron and iron furnace-slags, showing
  that the evidence is illusory and insufficient.
