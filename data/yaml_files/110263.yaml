tldr: The author, Wm. Hale, presents a new method for propelling vessels using a spiral-shaped
  propeller. He believes that previous failures in this area were due to the design
  of the apparatus, not the principle itself. The proposed design involves an eccentric
  curve resembling Archimedes' spiral, which creates resistance and propels the vessel
  forward.
