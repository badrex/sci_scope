revised_title: Investigating the Limit of the Liquid State
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author examines the boundary between liquid and gaseous states in various
  fluids, focusing on surface tension and capillarity. They propose a new distinction
  between gas and vapour based on molecular velocity and mean free path, and discuss
  the importance of accurate experimental methods in determining these properties.
topics:
- Phase Transitions
- Critical Temperature
- Surface Tension
- Capillarity
- Molecular Velocity
