revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Hydrogen Flocculi and Their Structure in
  the Solar Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Astronomy
tldr: The authors analyze the nature of hydrogen flocculi in the solar atmosphere
  and their structure at different levels. They investigate various hypotheses to
  explain the dark appearance of hydrogen flocculi on spectroheliograph plates and
  conclude that the dark flocculi are due to increased absorption and the bright flocculi
  represent regions of increased radiation.
