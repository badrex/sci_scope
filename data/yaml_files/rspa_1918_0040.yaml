revised_title: Colored Interference Bands and the Colors of Tempered Steel
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates colored interference bands and the colors of tempered
  steel, discovering that the colors are not due to thin-film interference but rather
  a form of selective opacity related to damped molecular periods and the angle of
  incidence.
topics:
- Optical Interference
- Colorimetry
- Metallurgy
- Polarized Light
- Selective Opacity
