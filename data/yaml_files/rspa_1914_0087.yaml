revised_title: Investigation of Aluminium-Gold Alloys and their Solid Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: This study examines the properties of aluminium-gold alloys, focusing on the
  solid solutions formed and their behavior during phase transitions. The authors
  discover that alloys containing up to 5% aluminium form uniform solid solutions,
  and that a eutectoid point exists at 524Â°C. They also observe a remarkable recalescence
  phenomenon, where the alloys undergo a structural change due to a reaction between
  their components, and propose that the new substance formed is the compound Au4Al.
