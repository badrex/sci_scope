revised_title: The Effect of White Light Illumination on the Extinction of Light by
  an Illuminated Retina
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author investigates the extinction of light by an illuminated retina using
  different degrees of white light. The results show that as the white illumination
  increases, the point of maximum extinction shifts between S.S.N. 40 and 52, and
  the persistency curves change accordingly.
