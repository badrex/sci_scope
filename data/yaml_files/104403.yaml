revised_title: An Observation of a Spina Bifida and the Misconception Surrounding
  its Terminology
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Embryology
tldr: The author describes a case of a spina bifida in an infant and challenges the
  common understanding of the term. He explains that a true spina bifida would require
  the canal and medulla spinalis to divide into two branches, the vertebrae bodies
  to be wider, and the spinal processes to diverge into two rows, which was not observed
  in this case.
