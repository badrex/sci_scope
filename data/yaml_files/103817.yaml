scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: Sigismund August Frobenius demonstrates various experiments with phosphorus,
  including the Machina Frobeniana, a machine that improves the preparation of oleum
  sulphuris. He also creates a transparent, malleable substance called Vitrum Molle,
  which turns into glass when heated and reverts to water when exposed to air.
