revised_title: Experiments on Stream-line Motion and the Measurement of Critical Velocity
  in Water Flow
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: The authors investigate the flow of water through pipes and the transition from
  stream-line to eddy motion using a thermal method. They measure the critical velocity
  at which this transition occurs and discuss the factors influencing it, such as
  initial disturbances and the influence of pipe walls.
topics:
- Hydrodynamics
- Strea
- Critical Velocity
- Eddy Motion
- Flow Visualization
