revised_title: 'Dispersion in Artificial Double Refraction: A Study of Stress-Optical
  Coefficient'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the stress-optical coefficient in artificial double
  refraction using a novel compression apparatus. They find that the coefficient varies
  with the wavelength, being numerically greater in the green than in the red, and
  confirm previous findings by Pockels and Wertheim.
