scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the stability and decomposition of gun-cotton under
  various conditions, including exposure to light, heat, and different temperatures.
  The results show that the composition and purity of gun-cotton play a significant
  role in its stability, and that exposure to heat and light can cause decomposition
  and potential explosions.
