revised_title: Synthesis of Formaldehyde from Carbon Dioxide and Water by Inorganic
  Colloids Acting as Transformers of Light Energy
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide and
  water using inorganic colloids as catalysts for sunlight energy transformation.
  They demonstrate that these colloids can convert light energy into chemical energy,
  synthesizing organic compounds from inorganic matter, potentially playing a role
  in the origin of life.
