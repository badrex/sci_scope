revised_title: Investigating the Synthesis of Fats in the Intestinal Mucosa
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of fats in the intestinal mucosa and mesenteric
  lymphatic vessels during fat absorption. The study finds that the synthesis of neutral
  fat occurs in the intestinal villi before the lymph reaches the mesenteric lacteals,
  and that pancreatic extracts have a marked ability to release fatty acids from soap.
