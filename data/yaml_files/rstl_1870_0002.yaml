revised_title: On the Refraction-Equivalents of the Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the refraction-equivalents of elements and compounds,
  finding that the refraction-equivalent of a mixture is the sum of the refraction-equivalents
  of its constituent elements. This discovery allows for the calculation of the effect
  of transparent bodies on light transmission based on their composition.
