revised_title: 'Efficiency of Muscular Work: A Reevaluation of Macdonald''s Methods'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Biomechanics
tldr: The author examines the efficiency of muscular work by analyzing the heat production
  and work performance of individuals. They propose a new method for calculating efficiency,
  which takes into account the rate of movement and the cost of movement, and suggest
  that the real efficiency of the muscular machine is indeterminate and may even be
  unity.
