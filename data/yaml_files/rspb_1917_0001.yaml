revised_title: 'Man''s Mechanical Efficiency in Work Performance: A Study of Heat
  Production and Cost of Movements'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Biomechanics
tldr: This study investigates the efficiency of human work performance in terms of
  heat production and the cost of movements. The authors analyze data from experiments
  involving different individuals performing various amounts of mechanical work, and
  they explore the relationship between heat production and body weight. They also
  discuss the concept of efficiency and its application to the performance of work
  and the cost of movements.
topics:
- Heat production
- Muscular work
- Efficiency
- Energy transformation
- Calorimetry
