scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: The authors investigate the combining properties of thermostable opsonins in
  immune sera, finding that they are absorbed by various substances and have a different
  relationship to serum complements compared to normal sera. They also discover that
  immune sera have a higher thermostable opsonin content, which may aid in diagnosing
  certain conditions.
