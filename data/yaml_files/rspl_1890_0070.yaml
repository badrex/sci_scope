revised_title: A New Method for Separating Copper from Bismuth
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Metallurgy & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a new method for separating copper from bismuth using a
  fusion process with sodium monosulfide, which allows for a rapid and efficient separation
  without the need for a wet process. This method has been successfully applied to
  large quantities of cupriferous bismuth, resulting in pure bismuth suitable for
  industrial use.
