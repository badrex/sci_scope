revised_title: Determination of the Absolute Unit of Resistance by Alternating Current
  Methods
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors describe the development of a standard mutual inductance and its
  use in determining the absolute unit of resistance using alternating current methods.
  They also introduce a secondary standard, the mutual inductometer, for direct comparison
  with resistance coils or other inductances.
topics:
- Electrical Resistance
- Alternating Current
- Mutual Inductance
- Standardization
- Measurement Techniques
