revised_title: Magnetism and Electrical Currents in Iron Bars
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Joule's research investigates the magnetism developed in iron bars by electrical
  currents. He found that the magnetic set, or the permanent change in magnetism,
  is proportional to the square of the current intensity. Joule also discovered the
  magnetic breaking point, where the set increases at a much higher rate as the saturation
  of the bar is approached.
