revised_title: The Asymptotic Expansion of Integral Functions Defined by Taylor's
  Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Approximations
tldr: The authors investigate the asymptotic expansions of integral functions defined
  by Taylor's series, using contour integration methods to obtain complete expansions
  for various standard types of functions. This work aims to provide a unified understanding
  of the behavior of these functions at infinity and is complementary to previous
  investigations of functions defined as products.
