tldr: The author presents a seven-year study of magnetic observations at Stonyhurst
  College Observatory, analyzing the Horizontal Force, Dip, and Declination. The study
  discusses the impact of various disturbances on the observations and provides corrections
  for changes in the station's location. The results contribute to the understanding
  of the Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time.
