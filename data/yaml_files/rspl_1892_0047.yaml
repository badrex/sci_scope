revised_title: Anatomical and Histological Study of the Hippocampus in Anosmatic Animals
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the hippocampal region in anosmatic animals, such as the
  bottlenosed whale, narwhal, and calf-seal, and compares it to the hippocampus of
  the ox. The study reveals that the fascia dentata is absent or rudimentary in these
  animals, and its development varies with the size of the olfactory organs. This
  finding sheds light on the function of the hippocampal region and suggests a need
  for a revised nomenclature.
