revised_title: Further Analysis of Air Compression Under Water
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author presents a mathematical model for the compression of air under water,
  providing equations for calculating the depth of air within a tube submerged in
  water. This model takes into account the weight of the water and the pressure of
  the air on the water's surface.
