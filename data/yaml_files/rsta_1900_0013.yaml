revised_title: 'An Experimental Investigation of the Thermodynamical Properties of
  Superheated Steam: Cooling Effects Produced by Free Expansion'
scientific_discipline: Chemical Engineering
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the thermodynamical properties of superheated steam
  and the cooling effects produced by free expansion. They find that adiabatic flow
  of saturated steam through an orifice occurs when the orifice is drilled in a piece
  of plate glass, allowing for easier and direct application of the theory to experimental
  results.
