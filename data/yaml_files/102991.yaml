revised_title: 'The Doctrine of Combinations and Alternations: A Mathematical Approach'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Combinatorics & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for calculating combinations and alternations
  of various elements, using indices of occurrences to represent the different positions
  and orders of elements in a sequence. This theory can be applied to a wide range
  of scenarios, including those involving multiple sets of elements.
