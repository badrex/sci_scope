revised_title: The Structure and Function of Muscular Fibers and Nervous Fibers
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author examines the structure of muscular fibers and compares them to the
  structure of nervous fibers. He finds that both consist of single rows of globules
  united by an elastic gelatinous transparent matter, but differ in the size of the
  globules and the degree of elasticity of the connecting medium. This discovery sheds
  light on the similarities and differences between muscle and nerve function.
