revised_title: Investigations into the Gaseous State and Homologous Points
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of gases and their relations of pressure
  and volume at different temperatures, leading to the discovery of homologous points
  and the effects of internal attractive forces on gas states.
topics:
- Gas laws
- Thermodynamics
- Equations of state
- Homologous series
- Internal attractive forces
