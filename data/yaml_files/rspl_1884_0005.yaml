revised_title: Electrolytic Deposition and the Influence of Cathode Material on Current
  Density
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The author investigates the electrolytic deposition of metals and discovers
  that the density of the current required for deposition varies depending on the
  cathode material. The cathode composed of the same metal being deposited often receives
  the deposit most readily. The author also examines the relationship between the
  Thomson effect and other physical properties of metals.
