revised_title: Improving Geodetic Observations through Solar Reflection and Focal
  Lights
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Surveying
tldr: The author describes the use of solar reflection and focal lights to improve
  the observation of distant stations in geodetic operations. He discusses the development
  of an instrument that reflects sunlight to enhance visibility and the use of powerful
  focal lights for nighttime observations. These methods were employed in the survey
  of Ireland and proved to be effective in overcoming challenges posed by weather
  conditions and distance.
