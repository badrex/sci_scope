revised_title: On the Equilibrium of Rotating Liquid Cylinders
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium of rotating liquid cylinders, developing
  a method to calculate the potential of a homogeneous mass using algebraic transformations.
  The study focuses on two-dimensional problems and provides equations for calculating
  the potential, cross-section, and center of gravity of a cylinder.
