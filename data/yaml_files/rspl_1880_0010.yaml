revised_title: Observations of a Sun-Spot and the Velocity of Iron Vapour
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The author observes a sunspot and tests the hypothesis of equal velocity of
  iron vapour in all iron lines. The observations indicate that while some lines show
  motion, others show a state of rest, suggesting further investigation and attention
  from other observers.
