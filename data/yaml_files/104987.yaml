scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Meteorology
tldr: The author, Dr. Peyssonnel, describes the dangerous currents and counter-tides
  in the Antilles, as well as the regular trade winds that drive water westward. He
  also discusses hurricanes, their signs, and their impact on the environment, suggesting
  that these storms are caused by a mixture of elements, including water, air, and
  fire, which create powerful clouds that compress water and force it against the
  ocean floor.
