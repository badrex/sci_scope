revised_title: 'On the Ultimate Nerve-Fibres Distributed to Muscle and Other Tissues:
  Observations on the Structure and Mode of Action of a Nervous Mechanism'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of nerve fibers in muscles and other
  tissues, and discusses the structure and mode of action of a nervous mechanism.
  He concludes that nerves form circuits and that the active phenomena are due to
  alterations in the intensity of the current passing along the nerves rather than
  their sudden interruption and completion.
