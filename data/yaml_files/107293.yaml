tldr: Thomas Young investigates the motion of fluids in pipes and the mechanics of
  blood circulation, proposing a new formula for calculating the friction and discharge
  of fluids. He compares his findings with previous theories and experiments, demonstrating
  the accuracy and applicability of his formula to various scenarios, including rivers
  and pipes of different diameters.
