scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of nerves in striated muscle fibers
  and concludes that nerves are distributed to every elementary fiber of voluntary
  muscles in humans and vertebrate animals. The study also highlights the presence
  of oval nuclei in nerve fibers, which may play a role in the peripheral distribution
  of nerves.
