revised_title: Determination of the Coefficient of Viscosity of Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the coefficient of viscosity of air using torsional
  vibrations of cylinders and spheres in a controlled environment. They compare their
  results with previous studies and discuss potential sources of error in other experiments.
  The mean coefficient of viscosity obtained from their experiments is presented.
