revised_title: The Conversion of Nitrates to Nitrites by Sunlight and their Assimilation
  by Green Leaves
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
tldr: The author investigates the conversion of nitrates to nitrites in aqueous solutions
  through sunlight exposure and discovers that green leaves can absorb these nitrites.
  This process is essential for the synthesis of organic compounds and the growth
  of plants.
