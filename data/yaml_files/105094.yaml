scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: John Ellicott presents two methods to prevent the irregular motion of clocks
  caused by temperature changes. The first method involves a unique pendulum design
  that uses different expansion rates of brass and iron to maintain consistent motion.
  The second method involves a temperature-measuring instrument, or pyrometer, to
  improve the accuracy of temperature-based adjustments.
