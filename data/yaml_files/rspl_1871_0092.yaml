revised_title: Determination of Atomic Weight of Thallium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the atomic weight of thallium using two different methods,
  dissolving metallic thallium in nitric acid and dissolving sulfate of thallium in
  water. The results of these experiments provide a more accurate determination of
  thallium's atomic weight.
