revised_title: Investigation of Fluctuations in Ionization Due to Beta-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate fluctuations in ionization caused by beta-rays from
  radium and discuss their findings in the context of radiation theory. They evaluate
  the fluctuation using a modified experimental setup and provide a detailed analysis
  of their results.
topics:
- Ionization
- Bet
- Fluctuations
