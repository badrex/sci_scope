revised_title: 'Development and Urinogenital Organs in Paludina vivipara: A Reevaluation
  of Torsion Theories'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This article investigates the development and urinogenital organs of Paludina
  vivipara, challenging previous theories on gasteropod torsion. The author presents
  evidence supporting Pelseneer's hypothesis of an actual twist of the body during
  development, rather than unequal growth as proposed by Butschli and Plate.
