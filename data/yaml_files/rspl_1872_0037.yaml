revised_title: Investigating the Relationship between Heat and Electricity Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author examines the relationship between heat and electricity discharge,
  discovering that the discharging power of a hot body depends on its temperature
  and distance from the electrified body. The study also reveals that the presence
  of heat alone does not cause discharge, and that discharge is more effective when
  the heat is of high intensity and passes directly to the electrified body from a
  neutral body within the inductive range.
