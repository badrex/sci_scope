revised_title: Determination of the Boiling Point of Sulphur and Standardizing Platinum
  Resistance Thermometers
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors determine the boiling point of sulphur and develop a method to standardize
  platinum resistance thermometers using this fixed point. They find that previous
  measurements of the boiling point were inaccurate, and provide a more precise value.
  The method allows for accurate temperature measurements over a wide range using
  electrical resistance thermometers.
