revised_title: On the Secular Acceleration of the Moon's Mean Motion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the secular acceleration of the Moon's mean motion and
  finds that the mean central disturbing force of the Sun, which diminishes the Moon's
  gravity towards the Earth, is also diminishing due to the decreasing eccentricity
  of the Earth's orbit. This results in an increase in the Moon's mean distance from
  the Earth and an increase in the mean angular motion.
