tldr: Sir Everard Home discusses the existence of smaller globules in animal structures
  and blood, independent of the larger blood globules. He also examines the composition
  of tumors and the role of lymph and blood globules in their formation. Home proposes
  to call these smaller globules 'globules of lymph' to distinguish them from blood
  globules.
