tldr: The author presents improvements to a hydrostatic electrometer, allowing for
  more precise measurements of attractive and repulsive forces in static electricity.
  The instrument is particularly useful for investigating the relationship between
  electrical quantity, intensity, and surface area.
topics:
- Electrical Measurement
- Static Electricity
- Electrometers
- Electrical Intensity
- Electrical Attraction
