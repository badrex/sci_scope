tldr: The author, T.S. Newbold, provides an account of the preparation process of
  the Ipoh or Upas poison used by the Jacoons and other aboriginal tribes in the Malayan
  Peninsula. The poison is applied to the points of arrows propelled from a blow-pipe.
  Three preparations are employed, with Mallaye being the most potent. The poison
  is derived from various plant roots and the shrub Mallaye. Experiments with poisoned
  arrows on living animals reveal symptoms beginning within minutes of the wound.
