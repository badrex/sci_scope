scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reagents
tldr: Dr. F. W. Pavy improves the volumetric estimation of sugar by modifying the
  ammoniated cupric test. He suggests using a higher amount of soda in the liquid
  and recommends a specific composition of the copper liquid for better precision
  in sugar analysis.
