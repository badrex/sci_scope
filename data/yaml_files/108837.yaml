scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Numerical Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The author presents a new method of approximation applicable to elliptic and
  ultra-elliptic functions, which can be used to facilitate computation and assign
  limits to integrals. The method involves using rational approximation and integrating
  terms to obtain the desired results.
