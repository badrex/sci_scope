tldr: The author presents a new method for solving systems of simultaneous differential
  equations, reducing the problem to the solution of a system of linear partial differential
  equations. This method allows for the determination of the number of possible integrals
  and provides a rigorous approach to the integration of partial differential equations
  of the second order.
