revised_title: Investigation of Lunar-Diurnal Magnetic Variation at Toronto
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, investigates the Moon's diurnal influence on the
  horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic force at Toronto using bifilar
  and vertical force magnetometers. The study reveals the lunar-diurnal variations
  of the inclination and total force, providing insights into the magnetic field's
  behavior influenced by the Moon.
