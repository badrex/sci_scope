revised_title: 'Stratification of Vesicular Ice by Pressure: A Theoretical Explanation'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Cryosphere
tldr: The author explains the stratification of vesicular ice by pressure, demonstrating
  how the arrangement of air or water-filled cavities in ice is influenced by pressure
  differences. This theory provides a physical explanation for the veined structure
  found in glaciers and can also account for the lamination of clear ice in hand specimens.
