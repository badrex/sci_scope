revised_title: Historical Note on a Relation between Gravitational Attraction and
  Elastic Depression in Isotropic Elastic Solids
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between gravitational attraction and
  elastic depression in isotropic elastic solids, focusing on the effects of load
  distribution and material properties. The study provides a historical overview of
  the development of this understanding and highlights the importance of considering
  compressibility in elastic materials.
