revised_title: Anatomy of the Kidney in Chiton
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the kidney in Chiton, refuting previous claims
  that the kidney is unpaired and has a median opening. The study reveals that the
  kidney is a paired gland with paired openings into the pallial groove and pericardium,
  and is constructed on the type found in other molluscan renal organs.
