scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Nutrition & Health
tldr: This study investigates the causes of scurvy and challenges the conventional
  belief that it is caused by a lack of fresh vegetables or lime juice. The authors
  present evidence that scurvy is a disease resulting from the consumption of tainted
  food, specifically tainted animal products, and suggest that the use of lime juice
  and fresh vegetables may not be effective in preventing or treating scurvy.
