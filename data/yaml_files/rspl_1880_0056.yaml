revised_title: Molecular Grouping Influence on Organic Bodies' Infra-Red Absorption
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors, Abney and Festing, investigate the influence of molecular grouping
  in organic bodies on their absorption in the infra-red region of the spectrum. They
  use an incandescent electric light source and various fluids to study the absorption
  spectra, concluding that each radical has a definite absorption in the infra-red
  and can be detected in a more complex body.
