scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author, Samuel Solly, investigates the connection between the anterior columns
  of the spinal cord and the cerebellum. He discovers that there are two sets of fibers,
  one from the anterior portion and the other from the posterior portion of the anterolateral
  column, that ascend to the cerebellum, providing evidence of a complete communication
  between the motor tract of the spinal cord and the cerebellum.
