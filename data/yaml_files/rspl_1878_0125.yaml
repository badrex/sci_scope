revised_title: 'Researches on Chemical Equivalence: Hydric Chloride and Hydric Sulphate'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Equivalents
tldr: The authors investigate the dynamical equivalents of hydric chloride and hydric
  sulphate using lactin, finding that while they have the same weight for saturation,
  they are not equal in the dynamical sense. This research contributes to the understanding
  of chemical reactions and equivalents.
