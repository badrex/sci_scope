scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geochronology
tldr: The author describes a petrefaction found on the coast of East Lothian, where
  sand and other materials at the ocean floor gradually harden into stone. The presence
  of iron and iron solutions significantly contribute to the process of concretion
  and induration of stone, suggesting that there is a continuous progressive induration
  of oceanic matter.
