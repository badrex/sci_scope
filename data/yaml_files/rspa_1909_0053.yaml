revised_title: 'The Ionisation Produced by an Alpha Particle: Part I'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the ionization produced by alpha particles using electrical
  methods and an ionization chamber. They determine the number of ions produced by
  an alpha particle along its entire path and discuss the challenges of obtaining
  accurate saturation currents in gases ionized by alpha rays at atmospheric pressure.
