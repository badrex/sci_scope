scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: This paper presents a theory for functions that satisfy Laplace's equation and
  are suitable for conditions on the surface of a circular anchor ring. These toroidal
  functions have potential applications in the theory of vortex rings and other physical
  problems. The paper also discusses zonal functions, expansions of space, and the
  electrical capacity of an anchor ring.
