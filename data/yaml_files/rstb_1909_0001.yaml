scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of the different arteries supplying
  the human brain using injection techniques with gelatine containing soluble colors.
  They analyze the blood supply to the basal ganglia, capsula interna, and cortical
  regions, providing insights into the arterial system of the brain.
