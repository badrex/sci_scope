revised_title: On the Isomerism of Normal Paraffins
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Petrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the isomerism of normal paraffins, specifically hexane,
  and discovers that two hexanes exist that must be considered as normal compounds,
  despite being different. This suggests that petroleum may consist of a mixture of
  isomeric and homologous paraffins, with normal hydrocarbons predominating.
