tldr: The author investigates the functions of the mucous membrane of the gallbladder,
  particularly in the conversion of hepatic bile to cystic bile. The study reveals
  that the mucous membrane acts as a catalytic body, altering the molecular structure
  of bile and affecting its properties. This research contributes to the understanding
  of mucous membranes' functions in digestion and metabolism.
