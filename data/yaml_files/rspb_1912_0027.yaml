revised_title: The Discovery and Analysis of Leucocytozoon in Guinea-Pigs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Parasitology & Immunology
tldr: The authors investigate the presence of 'Kurloff's bodies' within the large
  mononuclear leucocytes of guinea-pigs and determine that they are living parasites.
  They describe the life cycle of these parasites, which grow and multiply within
  the host cells, eventually causing the host's nucleus to be compressed. The authors
  use a new jelly method to examine and analyze the parasites, providing detailed
  observations of their development and growth stages.
