revised_title: Formation of Alcohol Phosphines Using Phosphonium Iodide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author discovers a new method for producing alcohol phosphines using phosphonium
  iodide. The process involves decomposing phosphonium iodide in the presence of alcohols,
  resulting in the formation of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartary phosphines.
  This method simplifies the production of these compounds and provides a more efficient
  way to study their properties and potential applications.
