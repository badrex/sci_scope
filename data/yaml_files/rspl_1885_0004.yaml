revised_title: On Certain Definite Integrals and Vortex Ring Theory in Gases
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author explores the use of definite integrals and integral transforms in
  solving partial differential equations related to gas dynamics, specifically in
  the context of the vortex ring theory. The article demonstrates how these techniques
  can be applied to understand the distribution of energy and the behavior of molecules
  in gases.
