revised_title: Investigation of Glass Colouration by Natural Solar and Other Radiations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author examines the coloration of glass due to natural solar and other radiations,
  discovering that exposure to intense sunlight or radium can cause a violet tint
  in glass containing manganese. The phenomenon is more pronounced at higher altitudes,
  where the atmosphere allows shorter wavelengths to pass through.
