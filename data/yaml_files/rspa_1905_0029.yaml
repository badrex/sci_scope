  of Matter and Ether
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The author explores the application of statistical mechanics to the dynamics
  of matter and ether, focusing on holonomic systems and the concept of irreversibility.
  The study of gas theory is used as a good illustration of this phenomenon.
