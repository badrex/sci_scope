revised_title: Investigation of the Time-Relations of the Excursions of the Capillary
  Electrometer
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electromechanical Systems
tldr: The authors investigate the time-relations of the excursions of the capillary
  electrometer and explore the effects of electrical resistance and overshooting phenomenon
  on the instrument's performance. They propose a method to overcome overshooting
  and determine the velocity of the meniscus during an excursion.
topics:
- Capillary Electrometer
- Tim
- Electrical Resistance
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Overshooting Phenomenon
