revised_title: On the Specific Inductive Capacity and Dielectric Constants of Fluids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrostatics
tldr: The author investigates the specific inductive capacity and dielectric constants
  of various fluids, including air, flint-glass, and castor oil, using condensers
  and electrical charges. The study examines the relations between potential difference,
  charge, and distance, and provides insights into the behavior of dielectric materials
  and the electromagnetic theory.
