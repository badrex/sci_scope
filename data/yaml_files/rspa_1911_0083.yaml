revised_title: Investigation of Conductivity and Electric Force in a Gas Between Parallel
  Plate Electrodes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author investigates the conductivity of a gas between parallel plate electrodes
  and the relationship between electric force and current. The study focuses on high
  forces and the impact of ionization on the field of force between the plates, providing
  equations for calculating the current and electric force in a uniform field.
