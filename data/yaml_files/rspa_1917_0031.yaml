revised_title: Inertia of Electrified Systems Moving with High Speed
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Relativity
tldr: The author investigates the effective inertia of electrified systems moving
  at high speeds, using a more accurate method than previous approaches. The results
  challenge the conclusions drawn from experiments on beta-rays, suggesting that further
  investigation is needed to confirm the validity of the findings.
