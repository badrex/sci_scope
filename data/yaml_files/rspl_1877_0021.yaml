revised_title: On the Attraction and Repulsion of Bubbles by Heat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of bubbles in fluid cavities when exposed
  to heat. He discovers that the attraction and repulsion of bubbles by heat depend
  on the type of liquid and the temperature conditions, with water bubbles being attracted
  and carbonic acid bubbles being repelled.
