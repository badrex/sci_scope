scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Sensory Systems
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between artificial color-blindness
  and successive contrast, exploring the effects of retinal fatigue on color perception
  and contrast. The study confirms earlier theories on the topic and provides further
  insight into the mechanisms of color vision and afterimages.
