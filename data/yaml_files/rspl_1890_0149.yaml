revised_title: Investigation of Phenomena Related to Villari's Experiments and Hughes'
  Induction Balance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates phenomena akin to Villari's experiments and Hughes'
  induction balance using ring cores and copper wires, discovering that the effects
  are due to the production and disappearance of circular magnetization.
topics:
- Magnetization
- Villari's Effect
- Induction Balance
- Iron Core
- Electromotive Forces
