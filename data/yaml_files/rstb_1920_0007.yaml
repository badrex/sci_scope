revised_title: 'Nerve-end Cells in the Dental Pulp: A Study of Their Structure and
  Function'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Developmental Biology
tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of nerve-end cells in the
  dental pulp. The author demonstrates that nerves enter the dentinal tubules and
  are distributed within the dentine, and identifies nerve-end cells that contribute
  processes to the dentine, representing the axons of the cells. These cells form
  a network around odontoblasts and communicate with each other, playing a crucial
  role in the distribution of nerves in the dentine.
