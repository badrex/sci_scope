  Tubes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Marine Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on thermometer bulbs and glass
  tubes, discovering that sudden pressure relief can cause them to collapse. The experiment
  demonstrates the resilience of water and the importance of designing robust instruments
  for deep-sea research.
