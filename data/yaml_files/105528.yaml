tldr: A sudden and unusual tide event occurred in Bristol, causing the water to rise
  rapidly and then sink just as quickly. This phenomenon was observed at various locations
  along the River Severn, with the tide rising to almost high-water mark before quickly
  receding and then flowing in again as expected.
