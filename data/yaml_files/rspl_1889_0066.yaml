revised_title: 'On the Effects of Pressure on the Magnetisation of Cobalt: A Study
  of Cobalt''s Magnetic Properties and Their Relation to Pressure and Magnetic Fields'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: This study investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt,
  revealing a cyclic change in magnetisation with the maximum magnetisation occurring
  when pressure is applied. The research also examines the relationship between strain,
  magnetisation, and the Villari critical field in cobalt.
