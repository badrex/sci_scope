revised_title: On the Origin and General Phenomena of Double Refraction in Regular
  Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the production of regular double refraction in molecules
  of bodies by simple pressure and observes the origin of the doubly refracting structure.
  He proposes that the property of uniaxal double refraction is communicated to molecules
  by the agency of pressure and that the forms of the ultimate molecules of crystals
  determine their primitive form and doubly-refracting structure.
