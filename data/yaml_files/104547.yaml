revised_title: Experiments on Caterpillar Respiration and Stigmata Function
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the respiration process in caterpillars, focusing on
  the function of stigmata. They conduct various experiments, including immersing
  caterpillars in water and blocking stigmata with butter, to determine the role of
  stigmata in respiration. The results suggest that the two anterior and two posterior
  stigmata play a more significant role in respiration than the others.
