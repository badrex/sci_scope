revised_title: The Solubility of Fatty Acids in Bile and Their Absorption from the
  Intestine
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the solubility of fatty acids in bile and their absorption
  from the intestine. They find that fatty acids are dissolved in bile as fatty acids,
  not as soaps, and that the solubilities are sufficient to account for the removal
  of all dietary fat from the intestine. They also study the reaction of intestinal
  contents during fat absorption and suggest that some fat may be absorbed as dissolved
  soaps.
