tldr: Edmund Halley's observations of the total solar eclipse on April 22, 1714, provide
  valuable data for refining the calculations of solar eclipses and establishing the
  accuracy of astronomical predictions. The observations were made using a well-equipped
  setup at the Royal Society's house in Crane-Court, London, and included measurements
  of the sun's distance from the zenith, the performance of a pendulum clock, and
  the behavior of the sky and moon during the eclipse.
