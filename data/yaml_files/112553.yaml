revised_title: Observations on Sun-Spots and Their Nature
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors present their observations on sun-spots made at the Kew Observatory,
  discussing the two prevailing theories on their nature. They believe sun-spots are
  cavities at a lower level than the sun's photosphere, supported by their observations
  of a sun-spot on May 7th, which produced indentations in the west limb. They invite
  other observers to focus on similar occurrences.
