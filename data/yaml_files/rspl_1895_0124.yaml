revised_title: Tetanisation and Evolution of CO2 in Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between tetanisation and the evolution
  of CO2 within the nerve, as well as the phenomena of summation, staircase phenomena,
  and positive and negative effects of electrical excitation. The study also explores
  the possible mechanisms behind these effects and the functional and chemical relations
  between the grey axis and the white sheath of a medullated fibre.
