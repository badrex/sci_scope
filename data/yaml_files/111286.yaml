scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Architecture
tldr: The author presents two fundamental principles for the stability of earthwork
  and masonry structures. The first principle states that the directions of greatest
  and least compressive stress in a mass of earth are at right angles, and the ratio
  of their difference to their sum should not exceed the sine of the angle of natural
  slope. The second principle, known as the transformation of structures, allows for
  the design of stable structures with different configurations while maintaining
  the same forces and dimensions.
