tldr: The author compares M. De Luc's rules for measuring heights by the barometer
  with theoretical principles and adapts them to Fahrenheit's thermometer scale. The
  paper includes tables and precepts for practical application and discusses the agreement
  between experimental results and theoretical predictions in the context of atmospheric
  pressure and temperature.
