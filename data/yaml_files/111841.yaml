revised_title: On the Solubility of the Sulphate of Baryta and the Influence of Mass
  on Chemical Affinity
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the solubility of the sulfate of baryta and discovers
  that its solubility is affected by the mass of the acid and the presence of other
  salts. This finding challenges the traditional understanding of solubility and demonstrates
  the influence of mass on chemical affinity.
