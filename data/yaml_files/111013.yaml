revised_title: On the Crystalline Polarity of Bismuth and other Bodies in Relation
  to Magnetic Force
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: Faraday's research investigates the magnetic properties of bismuth and other
  crystalline materials, discovering that they align with the magnetic field in a
  specific direction, known as the magnecrystallic axis. This phenomenon is distinct
  from traditional magnetic attraction and repulsion and is influenced by the crystalline
  structure of the material.
