revised_title: A Proposal for a New Division of the Quadrant for Improved Trigonometric
  Tables
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Trigonometry
tldr: Charles Hutton proposes a new method for constructing trigonometric tables by
  dividing the quadrant into equal parts of the radius instead of the traditional
  60th parts. This would simplify calculations and make the tables more accessible
  for various applications in science and mathematics.
