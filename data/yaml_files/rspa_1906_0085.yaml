revised_title: Investigation of the Dependence of Gravity on Temperature in a Partial
  Vacuum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the dependence of gravity on temperature using a modified
  balance apparatus in a partial vacuum. They find that a large apparent increase
  in weight occurs after heating, and suggest that this effect is due to a decrease
  in buoyancy of the air caused by the escape of heat from the calorimeter.
