tldr: This paper investigates the formation and structure of dental enamel in various
  animals, including the existence of a membrane between enamel-forming cells, the
  process of enamel formation through deposit, and the role of cells in enamel development.
  The study also examines the varicosities of enamel rods and the Retzius bands in
  forming teeth.
