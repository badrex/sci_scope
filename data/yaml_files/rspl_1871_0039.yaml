revised_title: On Measuring the Internal Resistance of a Multiple Battery
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a method to measure the internal resistance of a multiple
  battery by adjusting the galvanometer to zero. The method involves comparing the
  results of an assumed law with experimental values and considering the effects of
  magnetic forces on the battery.
