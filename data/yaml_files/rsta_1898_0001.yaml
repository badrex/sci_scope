  Three Independent Variables

tldr: The author presents a method for integrating partial differential equations
  of the second order in three independent variables when an intermediary integral
  does not exist. The method involves constructing subsidiary equations with one independent
  variable fewer than the original equation, leading to two classes of differential
  equations based on the characteristic invariant.
