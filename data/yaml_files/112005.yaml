  Foetus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author examines the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves in an acephalous
  foetus, discovering similarities in their distribution and structure to those in
  a normally formed foetus. The study provides insight into the development of the
  nervous system in such cases and contributes to the understanding of the relationship
  between the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves.
