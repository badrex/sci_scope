tldr: The author investigates the duration of the component parts of the radial sphygmograph
  trace in healthy individuals using a modified sphygmograph and finds that the first
  part of the arterial sphygmograph trace is almost constant, while the second part
  varies with the rapidity of heart movements. The study provides a method to diagnose
  potential imperfections in the circulatory system.
