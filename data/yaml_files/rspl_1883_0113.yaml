revised_title: A New Spring for Electric and Other Measuring Instruments
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Design
tldr: The authors propose a new type of spiral spring that eliminates the need for
  levers, racks, and pinions in measuring instruments, providing more accurate and
  reliable measurements. The design allows for greater rotation between the ends of
  the spring with minimal axial force, resulting in improved magnification of angular
  motion.
