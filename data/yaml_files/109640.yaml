scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight examines the formation of tree bark and the role of sap
  in the growth process. He discovers that both bark and alburnum can generate new
  bark, and that the cellular substance in both plays a crucial role in the process.
  Knight also investigates the role of the central vessels in the succulent annual
  shoot and finds that they possess similar powers of generation.
