  Airborne White Matter
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Entomology
tldr: The author observes a spider's web formation and its behavior, noting that the
  spider can control the direction of its web by winding and unwinding the thread.
  This observation leads the author to speculate that the airborne white matter found
  in the air during autumn may be formed in a similar manner.
