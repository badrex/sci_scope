revised_title: 'Cyanogenesis in Plants: The Great Millet, Sorghum Vulgare'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the poison contained in young plants of Sorghum vulgare,
  the Great Millet, and discover that it is due to the action of a hydrolytic enzyme
  on a cyanogenetic glucoside called 'dhurrin.' They also find that the poison is
  not present in the free state and is not produced by acting on the plant with boiling
  water or alcohol. The authors propose that the existence of the cyanogenetic glucoside
  in the young plant serves a protective purpose.
