revised_title: Polarization and Dispersion Properties of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, discusses his experiments on the refractive and
  dispersive powers of various substances. He observes a unique polarization effect
  in light transmitted through laminated agate and the high refractive power of chromate
  of lead. Brewster also notes the existence of two dispersive powers in all doubly
  refracting media, adding to the complexity of understanding light phenomena.
