revised_title: Determination of the Atomic Weight of Chlorine through Direct Burning
  with Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The authors attempt to directly determine the atomic weight of chlorine by burning
  it with hydrogen. They use a unique method of electrolysis to prepare hydrogen and
  chlorine, and then burn them in a closed vessel. The atomic weight of chlorine calculated
  from their experiments is 35.195.
