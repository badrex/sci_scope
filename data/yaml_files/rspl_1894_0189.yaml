revised_title: Temperature and Viscosity Relationships in Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between temperature and viscosity in
  various liquids, finding that the viscosity coefficient is generally consistent
  across different substances. Exceptions include alcohols and certain other liquids,
  which exhibit unique behavior. The study suggests that equal slope is the most suitable
  condition for comparing viscosities of different liquids.
