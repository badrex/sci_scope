revised_title: Determination of Earth's Density by Henry Cavendish
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Earth's Density
tldr: Henry Cavendish conducts experiments to determine the Earth's density using
  a sensitive apparatus that measures the attraction of leaden balls. He accounts
  for various sources of error and disturbance, and provides a method to calculate
  the Earth's density from the observed data.
