tldr: This article describes a lightning storm observed near Wakefield, Yorkshire,
  on March 1, 1774. The observer, Mr. Nicholson, noticed flames of light dancing on
  his horse and stick, and other witnesses reported their horses' heads appearing
  to be on fire. The storm also featured beautiful streams of light resembling an
  Aurora Borealis and falling stars. No thunder was heard during the event, and a
  large ball of fire was seen passing under the zenith later on.
