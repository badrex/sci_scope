revised_title: Temperature Dependence of Refractive Index in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the refractive index and temperature
  of various gases, including air, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide.
  They find that the temperature coefficients obtained are substantially less than
  those obtained by Mascart, and discuss the discrepancies between different observers'
  results.
