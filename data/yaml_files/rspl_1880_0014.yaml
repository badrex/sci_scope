revised_title: A Simplified Torsion-Gravimeter Design for Broun and Babinet's Instruments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Instrumentation
tldr: The author presents a simplified design for torsion-gravimeters, improving upon
  the existing designs of Broun and Babinet. The new design uses a weight suspended
  by two parallel wires, with the upper ends of the wires turned about their own individual
  axes, creating a torsion force. The author explains the principles and calculations
  behind the design, demonstrating its potential for use as a gravimeter.
