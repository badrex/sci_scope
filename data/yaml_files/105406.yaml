scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: George Edwards presents a unique amphibian found in Surinam, which is capable
  of transforming from a frog into a fish and back again. The creature's metamorphosis
  process is described in detail, and its characteristics are compared to those of
  European frogs and other known species. The author also discusses the potential
  implications of this discovery on our understanding of natural history and the role
  of metamorphosis in the animal kingdom.
