revised_title: A Mechanical Method for Dividing the Nautical Meridian Line in Mercator's
  Projection and its Relation to the Curva Catenaria
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geodesy & Geomatics
tldr: The author presents a mechanical method for dividing the nautical meridian line
  in Mercator's projection using a curve line and a ruler. The method also demonstrates
  the relationship between the meridian line and the catenary curve, which is the
  shape a hanging chain or cord naturally forms under its own weight.
