revised_title: Anomalies in the Winds of Northern India and their Relation to Barometric
  Pressure
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author examines anomalies in the winds of Northern India and their relation
  to barometric pressure. They propose a hypothesis that the cause of these anomalies
  lies in the interchange between lower and higher atmospheric strata, driven by convection
  currents resulting from diurnal heating of the Earth's surface.
