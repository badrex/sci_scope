tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the volume of inspired air and
  the amount of carbonic acid exhaled during respiration. The apparatus allows for
  continuous, long-term monitoring of respiration and its modifications by various
  physical agencies, providing valuable insights into the chemical and physical phenomena
  of respiration.
