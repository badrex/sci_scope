revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Rotation on Radiation from a Wooden Disk
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors, Balfour Stewart and P. G. Tait, conducted experiments to determine
  the effect of a wooden disk's rotation on its radiation. They found that the radiation
  increased when the disk rotated, both in the open air and in a vacuum. The results
  suggest that the effect of rotation on radiation is not significantly different
  in a vacuum compared to the open air.
