revised_title: Exploring the Light Border Phenomenon in Photographs and its Relation
  to Phosphorescence
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the light border phenomenon in photographs and explains
  it through the interaction of phosphorescence and light rays of different refrangibilities.
  The study involves various experiments with phosphors and light sources, demonstrating
  the impact of ray refraction and absorption on phosphorescence.
