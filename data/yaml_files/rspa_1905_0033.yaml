revised_title: Determination of Lowest Temperatures Using Thermo-Electric Junctions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Cryogenics
tldr: The author investigates the use of thermo-electric junctions, specifically a
  German-silver platinum couple, to determine the lowest temperatures. The results
  show that this method can accurately measure temperatures near absolute zero and
  provide valuable information for temperature measurement and research.
