revised_title: Effects of Gunshot Injuries on the Cerebral Hemispheres and Their Impact
  on Circulation and Respiration
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Neurosurgery
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of gunshot injuries on the cerebral hemispheres,
  focusing on the impact on circulation and respiration. They conducted experiments
  on etherized animals and found that the primary cause of death is not the arrest
  of the heart, but a sudden cessation of respiratory movements, which can be artificially
  restored.
