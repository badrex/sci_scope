revised_title: On the Method of Determining the Distance, Magnitude, and Weight of
  Stars
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Cosmology
tldr: The author proposes a method to determine the distance, magnitude, and weight
  of stars by analyzing the diminution of light velocity due to gravitational attraction.
  This method could potentially provide valuable data for astronomers and help in
  understanding the nature of celestial bodies.
