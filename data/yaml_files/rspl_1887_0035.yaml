scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: This article discusses the geometrical construction of the honey bee cell and
  the embryology of monotremata and marsupialia. It explores the relationship between
  the cell's geometry and the development of actual cells, as well as the egg-membranes
  and ovum development in monotremata and marsupialia.
