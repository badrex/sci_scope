revised_title: On the Discrimination of Maxima and Minima Solutions in the Calculus
  of Variations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Optimization
tldr: The author presents a method for finding maxima and minima solutions in the
  calculus of variations without relying on algebraic transformations. The method
  considers the continuity of the dependent variables and the second variation to
  determine the sign of the quadratic function, allowing for a more efficient approach
  to solving complex problems.
