revised_title: Inheritance and Phenomena in Sweet Peas and Stocks
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on inheritance in sweet peas and stocks, discovering
  that the appearance of colored flowers is due to the presence of two factors from
  distinct allelomorphic pairs. They also find that the F2 ratio in sweet peas and
  stocks is 9 colored to 7 white, and that there is a gametic coupling of pollen characters
  in certain cases.
