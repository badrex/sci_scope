revised_title: Gametic Coupling and Seed Shape in Pisum
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Plant Breeding
tldr: This study investigates the genetic coupling between seed shape and tendrils
  in peas. The researchers find a unique gametic coupling system of 63:1, which affects
  the expression of tendrilled and round seed traits. This system provides insight
  into the heredity of these traits in Pisum species.
