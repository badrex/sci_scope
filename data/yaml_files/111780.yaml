scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geochronology
tldr: The author explores the formation of alluvial land in Egypt's Nile Valley, focusing
  on the annual inundations and sediment deposits. By studying the depth of sediment
  layers around monuments of known age, the author aims to estimate the time elapsed
  since the first layer of sediment was deposited, contributing to the understanding
