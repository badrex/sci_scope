revised_title: The Role of Oily Films in the Formation of Dry Fog
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Air Quality
tldr: The author investigates the role of coal-tar and paraffin oil films in the formation
  of dry fog, finding that these films can significantly reduce the evaporation of
  water droplets in foggy atmospheres. This phenomenon can explain the existence of
  dry fog and the irritating character of fogs in large towns, as some products of
  coal distillation are irritating to the respiratory organs and have low volatility
  at ordinary temperatures.
