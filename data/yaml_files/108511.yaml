revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Mountain Mass Attraction on Apparent Astronomical
  Latitude in Geodetic Surveys
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author examines the impact of mountain mass attraction on the apparent astronomical
  latitude of stations in geodetic surveys, concluding that the real disturbance is
  less than that calculated using only the law of gravitation. The author suggests
  that the earth's crust floats in lava, with the downward projection of the crust
  providing support for elevated landforms.
