revised_title: Investigating Parallax and Temperature Variations
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Astrometry
tldr: The author examines the effects of temperature variations on parallax measurements
  and finds that keeping the observatory at a consistent temperature eliminates discrepancies
  in the index error. Further observations are needed to confirm the results using
  new fixed instruments.
