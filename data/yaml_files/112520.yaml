revised_title: On the Law of Atmospheric Resistance to Rifled Projectiles
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace & Aeronautics
tldr: The author investigates the law of atmospheric resistance to rifled projectiles
  using data from Colonel Halford's experiments with Metford's match-rifle. By assuming
  a resistance varying as the cube of the velocity, the author finds a near-perfect
  agreement with the results of observation, confirming previous work by Professor
  HÃ¼lle and Professor Bashforth.
