revised_title: The Discovery of A-Fibrinogen and Its Role in Blood Coagulation
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hematology & Blood Disorders
tldr: The author, Dr. L. C. Wooldridge, discovers a new substance called A-fibrinogen
  in the plasma that plays a crucial role in blood coagulation. He also identifies
  three coagulable bodies in the plasma and suggests that coagulation is nearly allied
  to crystallization rather than being a purely fermentative process.
