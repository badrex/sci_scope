revised_title: 'A New System of Marine Petrifaction Origin: Fire Instead of Water'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Petrology
tldr: The author presents a new system for the origin of petrifactions found in the
  earth, suggesting that they are caused by fire rather than the universal deluge.
  He examines the systems of Burnet and Woodward, refutes their opinions, and establishes
  his own system based on subterranean fire. The author also discusses the new island
  that rose out of the sea in 1707 and the mountain that rose out of the earth in
  1538, using these events to support his hypothesis.
