revised_title: Researches towards Establishing a Theory of the Dispersion of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Baden Powell, continues his research on the dispersion of light,
  testing the accuracy of M. Cauchy's theory in various media. He presents new calculation
  methods and formulae, concluding that the undulatory theory holds true for most
  cases, with potential need for further development in higher cases.
