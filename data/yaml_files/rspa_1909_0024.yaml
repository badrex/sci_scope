revised_title: Optimal Lens Parameters for Photographic Enlargement of Small Solid
  Objects
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the best conditions for photographic enlargement of
  small solid objects, determining the optimal lens parameters for achieving the highest
  definition in the picture. The study focuses on the relationship between the angular
  aperture, focal length, and the distance between the object and the lens, providing
  a formula for calculating the minimum diameter of the lens required to separate
  details in the image.
