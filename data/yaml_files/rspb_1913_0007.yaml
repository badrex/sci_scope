revised_title: Investigating the Nature of Wallerian Degeneration in Nerves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: This study investigates the process of Wallerian degeneration in nerves and
  its relationship to the life of the nerve fiber. The authors examine the effects
  of temperature and transplantation on nerve degeneration, concluding that the process
  may not solely depend on the life of the nerve fiber.
