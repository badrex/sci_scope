revised_title: 'Researches on Tides: Diurnal Inequality and Its Effects on Tide Heights'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal inequality of tide heights at Plymouth and
  Singapore, discovering that the height of low water is also affected by a similar
  inequality. The study provides a formula to calculate the diurnal inequality and
  its effects on tide heights, with the epoch and multiplier varying depending on
  the location and time of year.
