  and Rhabdospheres'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the nature of coccospheres and rhabdospheres, marine
  organisms with calcareous skeletons, and classify them as a new order of marine
  algae called Coccosphaeraceae. They describe their structure, growth, and how they
  differ from diatoms, and discuss their ecological significance in deep-sea and surface
  waters.
