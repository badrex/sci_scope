  Carbonates
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the formula of silicic acid and its reactions with alkaline
  carbonates, specifically carbonates of potash, soda, and lithia. The experiments
  reveal different results for each carbonate, suggesting that the equivalent of silicic
  acid may vary depending on the alkaline compound used.
