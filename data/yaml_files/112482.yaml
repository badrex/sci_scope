tldr: This paper by William Shanks explores the calculation of Euler's Constant and
  its numerical value. Shanks discusses the differences in values when using different
  numbers of terms in the harmonic progression and the slow extension of the value
  of E with higher values of n. He also questions the previous suggestion of using
  50,000 or 100,000 terms to achieve 100 decimal places of accuracy.
