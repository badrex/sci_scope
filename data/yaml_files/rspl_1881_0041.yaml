revised_title: 'Effects of Stress on the Thermoelectric Quality of Metals: Part I'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: This study investigates the effects of mechanical stress on the thermoelectric
  quality of metals, specifically iron, and reveals unexpected results. The research
  shows that the thermoelectric effects change cyclically with the application and
  removal of stress, and that these changes are not solely due to the stress and strain
  on the metal. The findings suggest that similar cyclic phenomena may exist in other
  effects of stress and in the changes of matter's qualities when subjected to varying
  conditions.
