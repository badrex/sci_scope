scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Psychology
tldr: The author investigates the luminosity curves of individuals with normal and
  abnormal color vision using a spectroscope. They discover that color-deficient observers
  have altered luminosity curves, with the red and green sensation curves being modified,
  reducing the overall brightness of the colors they perceive.
