tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of ternary quadratic forms, expanding
  on Eisenstein's theory and providing demonstrations of previously undemonstrated
  results. The paper covers topics such as the orders and genera of these forms, their
  transformation, and the weight of classes, orders, and representations.
