scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: The author investigates the mathematical properties of ancient hour lines on
  sundials, specifically those of the Greeks and Romans. They demonstrate that these
  lines, when extended, form curves of double curvature on a sphere and describe a
  conical surface with unique properties. The author also discusses the differences
  in the number of undulations present in these curves and how they can be represented
  geometrically.
