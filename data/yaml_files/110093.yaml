  by Rotation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the temporary magnetic effect induced in iron bodies
  by rotation and finds that the effect is not permanent. He also discovers that the
  direction of the needle is attracted or repelled depending on the motion of the
  ball and the axis of rotation.
