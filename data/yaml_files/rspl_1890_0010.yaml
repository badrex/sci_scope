tldr: The author investigates the chemical products of Bacillus anthracis growth and
  their physiological effects. They discover that the albumoses, proto-albumose and
  deutero-albumose, are toxic and have strong alkalinity in solution. The alkaloid
  produced by the bacillus also causes symptoms and lesions similar to those of the
  albumoses, with the potential for enlargement of the spleen and local subcutaneous
  edema.
