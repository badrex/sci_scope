revised_title: Variation of Conductivity with Temperature and Tests of Alloys
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The author presents a study on the variation of conductivity with temperature
  and tests of various alloys, including platinoid and German silver. The results
  show that the numbers agree closely, but further experiments are needed to obtain
  values of conductivity for different liquids and temperatures.
