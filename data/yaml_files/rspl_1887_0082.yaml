revised_title: 'Experiments on the Discharge of Electricity through Gases: Neutralization
  of Normal Forces at the Surface of Electrified Bodies'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the discharge of electricity through gases
  and discovers that normal forces at the surface of electrified bodies are neutralized
  when a discharge is passing through a gas. This finding challenges the common belief
  that only tangential forces exist at the surfaces of vessels enclosing a gas with
  a discharge.
