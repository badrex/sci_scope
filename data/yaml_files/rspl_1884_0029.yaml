revised_title: A Redetermination of the Atomic Weight of Cerium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author redetermines the atomic weight of cerium by preparing anhydrous cerium
  chloride using a new method. The process involves passing dry hydrochloric acid
  gas over air-dry cerium oxalate and heating it to obtain a white, anhydrous chloride.
  The author's new method of obtaining anhydrous cerium chloride allows for a more
  accurate redetermination of the atomic weight of cerium.
