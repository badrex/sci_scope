revised_title: A Study on Single and Double Theta-Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: This memoir by A. Cayley explores the single and double theta-functions, their
  definitions, and their connections to exponential functions, elliptic functions,
  and Abelian functions. The study extends to the establishment of the product-theorem
  and the development of the two theories separately.
topics:
- Mathematical Analysis
- Algebraic Geometry
- Number Theory
- Abelian Functions
- Elliptic Functions
