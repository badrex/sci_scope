revised_title: Determination of the Ohm in Absolute Measure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The authors, Lord Rayleigh and Arthur Schuster, discuss the determination of
  the ohm, or British Association unit of resistance, using the method of the Committee.
  They analyze the effect of various factors, such as self-induction and level errors,
  on the measurement and provide a detailed explanation of their experimental setup
  and calculations.
