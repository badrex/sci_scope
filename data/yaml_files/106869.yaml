scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Urology & Nephrology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on human calculi, testing their solubility in
  lixivium, and finds that the solubility of calculi varies greatly, with some being
  completely dissolved and others remaining largely unchanged. The author concludes
  that lixivium can be an effective remedy for certain cases of gravel and stone,
  but not all, and emphasizes the importance of examining the specific composition
  of calculi to determine the best course of treatment.
