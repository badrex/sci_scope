  Regions

scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: This article presents observations on the diurnal variation of the magnetic
  needle at the Whale Fish Islands in Davis's Strait. The authors, Henry Foster and
  W. E. Parry, found that the diurnal change of variation in magnetic needle direction
  is influenced by the position of the sun and, to a lesser extent, the moon. They
  also observed that the influence of the aurora borealis on the magnetic needle is
  negligible. The authors provide a detailed analysis of their observations, including
  fluctuations in the magnetic needle's position and intensity, and the dip of the
  needle at various stations visited by their expedition.
