scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: This study investigates the ultra-violet spectrum of ytterbium, a rare earth
  element, and its separation from other elements. The author examines various methods
  of ytterbia preparation and discusses the challenges of separating ytterbium from
  other elements, such as thulium, copper, and calcium. The study also presents the
  wave-lengths of recognizable lines of ytterbium, thulium, calcium, and copper.
