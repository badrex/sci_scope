revised_title: Investigating the Identity of Spectral Lines of Different Elements
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors examine the identity of spectral lines in different elements using
  a reflecting grating and electric arc light source. They find that many lines are
  coincident or close together, particularly in iron, and discuss the implications
  for understanding the composition of elements and their spectra.
