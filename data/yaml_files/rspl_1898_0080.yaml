revised_title: Experimental Investigation of Gases Evolved on Heating Mineral Substances
  and Meteorites
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the gases produced when heating minerals and meteorites
  and finds that the gases are produced by the interaction of the mineral's non-gaseous
  constituents. The study focuses on the relationship between the amount of ferrous
  oxide, water, and carbon dioxide present in the mineral and the quantity of hydrogen
  and carbon monoxide produced.
