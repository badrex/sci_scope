tldr: William Huggins and his wife, Mrs. Huggins, discovered the presence of hydrogen
  lines in the photographic spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion. Their findings
  suggest that the hydrogen lines are stronger and broader on the plate as the Trapezium
  with its stars is approached. This discovery provides new insights into the conditions
  within the nebula.
