revised_title: 'Stellar Photography and Photometry: Establishing a Relationship between
  Photographic Images and Photometric Magnitudes'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between photographic images of stars
  and their photometric magnitudes, developing a method to measure the diameters of
  stellar images on sensitized films. This method establishes a physical relation
  between the diameters of the images and their photometric magnitudes, providing
  a more accurate way to measure star brightness.
