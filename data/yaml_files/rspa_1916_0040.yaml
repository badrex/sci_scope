revised_title: Determining the Sign and Magnitude of Electric Discharges in Lightning
  Flashes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Atmospheric Electricity
tldr: The author investigates the sign and magnitude of electric discharges in lightning
  flashes using changes in the vertical electric field. By measuring these changes,
  they can determine the electric moments of lightning discharges and gain insight
  into the balance of electrical charges between the atmosphere and the earth.
