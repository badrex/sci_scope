revised_title: Investigation of Gases Enclosed in Crystalline Rocks and Minerals
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Mineralogy
tldr: The author examines gases enclosed in crystalline rocks and minerals, focusing
  on the presence of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The study reveals that the gases
  are likely a result of the rocks being crystallized in an atmosphere rich in carbon
  dioxide and steam, in contact with easily oxidizable substances at moderately high
  temperatures.
