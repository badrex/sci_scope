revised_title: The Impact of Environmental Conditions on Developing Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of environmental conditions, specifically
  temperature, on the development of echinoid organisms. They find that exposure to
  abnormal temperatures during impregnation and development can lead to significant
  size variations in the larvae, with the degree of reaction diminishing over time.
