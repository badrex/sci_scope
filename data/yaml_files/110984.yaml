revised_title: Investigating the Disruptive Discharge of Accumulated Electricity and
  its Relation to Lightning
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: Isham Baggs explores the disruptive discharge of accumulated electricity and
  its connection to lightning. He develops two instruments to regulate the discharges
  of a Leyden jar and a battery, and concludes that the tension of the electricities
  in a series of jars can be greatly augmented, leading to violent explosions. He
  compares this to a voltaic pile and suggests that the phenomena of thunderclouds
  can be explained through similar experimental results.
