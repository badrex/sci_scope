revised_title: Dielectric Constants of Frozen Electrolytes at and above the Temperature
  of Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Fleming and Dewar investigate the dielectric constants of various electrolytes
  at low temperatures, including cryohydrates, and find that dielectric constants
  vary significantly depending on the electrolyte composition and temperature.
topics:
- Dielectric constants
- Electrolytes
- Low temperatures
- Cryohydrates
