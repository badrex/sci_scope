revised_title: New Instances of the Absorbing Power of Streams and Pulsation of Jets
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The author presents experiments demonstrating the absorbing power of fluid streams
  and the pulsation of jets. The study involves various setups, such as vertical tubes
  and bent tubes, to observe the effects of the absorbing power. The author also explains
  the pulsatory character of jets, attributing it to the introduction of air bubbles
  and pressure changes.
