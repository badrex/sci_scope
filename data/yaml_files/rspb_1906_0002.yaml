revised_title: Effects of Alkalies and Acids on Growth and Cell Division in Fertilized
  Eggs of Echinus esculentus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Developmental Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of alkalies and acids on growth and cell
  division in fertilized eggs of Echinus esculentus. They find that small variations
  in hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations can significantly impact cell growth
  and division, and that these changes may be related to the development of malignant
  diseases.
