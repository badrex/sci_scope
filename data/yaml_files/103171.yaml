revised_title: Ascent of Water between Two Glass Planes in an Hyperbolick Figure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, describes an experiment involving the ascent of
  water between two glass planes in a hyperbolick figure. The experiment demonstrates
  the effect of surface tension and capillary action on the elevation of water at
  different angles. The results are presented in tables, showing the relationship
  between distance and the height of the water column.
