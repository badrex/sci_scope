revised_title: The Nuclear Constitution of Atoms and the Discovery of Isotopes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: Sir Ernest Rutherford's lecture discusses the nuclear constitution of atoms,
  focusing on the discovery of isotopes and the relationship between atomic number
  and nuclear charge. Rutherford's experiments on the scattering of alpha particles
  led to the conclusion that atoms have a massive, positively charged nucleus surrounded
  by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The atomic number, which defines an
  element's properties, is equal to the charge on the nucleus, and this finding supports
  the existence of isotopes with identical chemical properties but different masses.
