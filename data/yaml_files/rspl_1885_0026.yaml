revised_title: 'Magnetisation of Steel, Cast Iron, and Soft Iron: A Study of Their
  Total and Residual Magnetisation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This study investigates the total and residual magnetisation of steel, cast
  iron, and soft iron using various magnetising forces. The results show that charcoal
  iron has the highest magnetisability, while soft steel has the lowest. Soft Scotch
  iron's magnetisability approaches that of charcoal iron. Annealing the wires generally
  lowers their retentiveness and raises their magnetisability for all forces.
