revised_title: Comparison of Arctic Sound Velocity Experiments with Laplace's Formula
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Sound
tldr: The author compares Captain Parry's and Lieutenant Foster's experiments on the
  velocity of sound in the Arctic regions with Laplace's theoretical formula. The
  results show a close agreement, confirming the formula's accuracy and suggesting
  that any discrepancies are likely due to imperfections in the formula rather than
  observer error.
