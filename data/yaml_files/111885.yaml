revised_title: 'On the Descent of Glaciers and Metal Plates: A Comparative Study of
  Temperature and Motion'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Geophysics
tldr: The author investigates the descent of metal plates and glaciers, finding that
  the descent is influenced by temperature variations and the coefficient of expansion.
  The study demonstrates that glaciers, being more dilatable, would experience a faster
  descent than metal plates under similar conditions.
