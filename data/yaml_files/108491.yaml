revised_title: Vibrations and Tones Produced by Contact of Bodies with Different Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the vibrations and tones produced by the contact of
  bodies with different temperatures, specifically focusing on iron, copper, and brass
  rockers. The study reveals that the vibrations are dependent on the difference in
  temperature between the two surfaces in contact and that the best conductor of heat
  produces the greatest effect.
