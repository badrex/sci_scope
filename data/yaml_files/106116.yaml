revised_title: Kepler's Method of Computing Moon's Parallaxes in Solar Eclipses
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Eclipses
tldr: The author presents an improved method for calculating the moon's parallax in
  solar eclipses using Kepler's method, extending its application to all degrees of
  the moon's latitude and assigning the moon's corresponding apparent diameter. This
  method can be applied to solar eclipses and helps determine the moon's apparent
  latitude and its distance from the zenith.
