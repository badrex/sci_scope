tldr: Captain Edward Sabine discusses the limitations of traditional magnetic instruments
  and presents his improved dipping needle design. He conducts experiments in Regent's
  Park to determine the dip of the magnetic needle in London, resulting in a mean
  dip of 70Â°03'. Sabine emphasizes the importance of avoiding local attractions and
  using suitable locations for accurate magnetic observations.
