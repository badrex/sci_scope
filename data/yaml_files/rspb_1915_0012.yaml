revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Arm Compression on Arterial Pressure Measurements
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Vascular Medicine
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of arm compression on arterial pressure measurements
  and find that increased tension in the arterial wall affects the conduction of the
  systolic wave, leading to variations in pressure readings. They also demonstrate
  that the simple schema of compressing an artery in a chamber does not accurately
  represent the conditions in the arm.
