  Analysis and Experimental Investigation'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This paper investigates the magnetic induction and its reversal in spherical
  iron shells using a theoretical analysis and experimental methods. The authors explore
  the effects of magnetizing coils and eddy currents on the demagnetization process,
  providing insights into the behavior of iron under small magnetic forces.
topics:
- Magnetic Induction
- Magnetic Reversal
- Spherical Iron Shells
- Magnetic Coils
