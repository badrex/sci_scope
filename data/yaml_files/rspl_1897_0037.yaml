revised_title: Improving the Method of Determining Vapour Pressures of Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the vapor pressure of solutions,
  which improves upon previous static methods. They test their method using various
  salt solutions and find that it provides more accurate and consistent results. This
  new method has the potential to advance the understanding of solution chemistry
  and thermodynamics.
