revised_title: 'Cholesterol Excretion in Dogs: A Study on the Origin and Destiny of
  Cholesterol in the Animal Organism'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Nutrition
tldr: The authors investigate cholesterol excretion in dogs, feeding them different
  diets and analyzing their feces. They find that cholesterol is excreted in small
  amounts and primarily comes from the food, rather than being produced by the animal's
  metabolism.
