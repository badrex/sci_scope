scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates serum proteids and discovers that serum albumin can
  be differentiated into three distinct proteids through heat-coagulation. The study
  also examines the effects of various salts on the proteids and their coagulation
  temperatures.
