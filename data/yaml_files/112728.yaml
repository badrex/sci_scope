tldr: The author, Nevil Story-Maskelyne, investigates the mineral composition of meteorites
  using a microscope and a new method of analyzing silicates. He examines the Busti
  aerolite of 1852 and identifies the presence of calcium sulfide (Oldhamite) in the
  meteorite, providing insights into the mineralogy and history of these celestial
  objects.
