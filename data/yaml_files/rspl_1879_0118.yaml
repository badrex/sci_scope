revised_title: Accelerating Fruit Ripening with Electric Light
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author demonstrates that electric light can promote the ripening of fruit,
  such as strawberries, by accelerating the formation of chlorophyll and other compounds
  necessary for ripening. This discovery could potentially allow horticulturists to
  grow high-quality fruit year-round, independent of sunlight.
