revised_title: 'Experimental Investigation of Specific Heats of Gases at Constant
  Volume: Carbon Dioxide'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the variation of the specific heat at constant volume
  of carbon dioxide attending changes in absolute density. The study extends previous
  research on carbon dioxide, air, and hydrogen, and reveals that the linear nature
  of the variation of specific heat with density, deduced from former results, is
  not applicable over the new, more extended range of observation.
