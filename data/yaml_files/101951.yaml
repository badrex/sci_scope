  Skin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Histology
tldr: The author, Anth Van Leuwenhoek, discovers animalcules in dental grit and examines
  the scaleyness of the skin using a microscope. He finds that the upper part of the
  skin is covered in tiny scales similar to fish scales, which help to protect and
  shed the skin. He also observes that there are no pores in the upper skin, and moisture
  is expelled through the spaces between the scales.
