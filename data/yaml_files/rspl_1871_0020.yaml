scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical properties and isomerism of fucusol, a
  substance derived from seaweeds, and discovers that it has similar physical and
  chemical properties to furfurol. Fucusol yields a new isomer of pyromucic acid and
  forms a unique silver salt, silver f-pyromucate, which is different from the one
  obtained from furfurol.
