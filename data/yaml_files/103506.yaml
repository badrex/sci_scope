revised_title: On the Roots of Equations and Algebraic Rules
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a continuation of his previous letter, discussing the roots
  of equations and demonstrating algebraic rules. He explores various methods for
  determining when roots are imaginary and provides a general rule for finding limits
  greater than any roots of an equation. Additionally, he discusses theorems in series,
  fluxions, and equation resolution.
