revised_title: The Extent of Uniformity in Optical Glass Production
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: This paper investigates the uniformity and homogeneity of various types of optical
  glass produced by different manufacturers over the past decade. The refractive indices
  and dispersion values for 27 glass meltings are analyzed, revealing that heavy barium
  crown glasses exhibit the greatest variation in homogeneity within the same melting.
