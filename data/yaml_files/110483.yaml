revised_title: The Influence of Light on Plant Functions and Atmospheric Interactions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: Charles Daubeny's study investigates the effects of light on various plant functions,
  including oxygen production, leaf color change, moisture exhalation, and water absorption.
  He also examines the role of plants in purifying the atmosphere and the relationship
  between carbonic acid absorption and oxygen evolution. The results suggest that
  light plays a specific stimulatory role in plant functions, with the most luminous
  rays having the greatest impact.
