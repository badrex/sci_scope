revised_title: On the Motion of a Rigid Body and the Ellipsoidal Top
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the motion of a rigid body moving freely about a fixed
  point and introduces the concept of the ellipsoidal top, which represents the motion
  of a free rotating solid in space and time. The author also establishes a dynamic
  relationship between the free rotating body and the ellipsoidal top and explores
  the kinematical and algebraical aspects of the motion.
topics:
- Rigid Body Dynamics
- Ellipsoidal Top
- Kinematics
- Confocal Ellipsoids
- Friction and Pressure
