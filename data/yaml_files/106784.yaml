revised_title: On the Metamorphosis of a Bird into a Fatty Substance
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: Thomas Sneyd discovers a bird that has undergone a metamorphosis, transforming
  its substance into a hard fatty matter. The substance resembles spermaceti in consistency
  but lacks taste and smell. Sneyd speculates that the change occurred while the bird
  was buried in the mud and suggests a connection to the observations made by M. Foucault
  in the Cemetery des Innocents.
