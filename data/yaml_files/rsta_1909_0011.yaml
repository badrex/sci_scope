revised_title: The Mobilities of Ions Produced by Röntgen Rays in Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the mobilities of positive and negative ions produced
  by Röntgen rays in various gases and vapors using an electric field method. They
  determine the ionic mobilities in a series of vapors, providing valuable information
  about the structure of ions and the charge associated with them.
topics:
- Röntgen Rays
- Ion Mobility
- Electric Field
- Gas Ionization
- Vapor Ionization
