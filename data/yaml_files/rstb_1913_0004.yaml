  Ear and Their Relation to the Motor System

scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of stimulating and extirpating the labyrinth
  of the ear and their relation to the motor system. The authors explore the mechanisms
  of stimulation, the impact of unilateral and bilateral removal of the labyrinth,
  and the resulting phenomena of nystagmus, vertigo, and sensations of rotation. They
  also discuss the role of the labyrinth in eye movements and the influence of the
  head's position on reflexes arising from limb stimulation.
