tldr: The author presents experiments demonstrating that during natural breathing,
  each expansion of the chest increases arterial tension and shortens the diastolic
  interval, leading to increased force and frequency of heart contractions. This challenges
  the prevailing belief that inspiration causes a decrease in both force and frequency.
