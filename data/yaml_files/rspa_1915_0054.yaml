  Physics
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author applies the principle of dynamical similitude to molecular physics,
  exploring the energy content and distribution of molecular systems. The study focuses
  on the conditions for dynamical similarity and the identification of corresponding
  states in molecular systems, with implications for understanding chemical reactions
  and the behavior of gases.
