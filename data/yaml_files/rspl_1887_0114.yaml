  Acid and Organic Acids'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Soil Science & Fertility
tldr: The authors investigate the sources of nitrogen in vegetation, focusing on the
  role of nitric acid and organic acids in the soil. They find that nitric acid is
  an important source of nitrogen for leguminous crops, but it is not sufficient to
  account for the nitrogen uptake of all plants. They also explore the potential role
  of organic acids in the nitrogen uptake process, but further research is needed
  to understand their exact contribution.
