revised_title: On the Vertebral Chain of Birds and its Evolutionary Abbreviation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Ornithology
tldr: The author examines the development and evolution of the vertebral chain in
  birds, observing a reduction in the number of vertebrae as they ascend towards smaller,
  higher species. The study suggests that birds may have evolved from long, eel-like
  forms and that the Swan, with its large number of vertebrae, is closer to the Struthious
  birds in its skeletal structure.
