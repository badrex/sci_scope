revised_title: Experimental Determination of the Variation of Critical Velocity of
  Water with Temperature
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hydrology & Fluid Mechanics
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of temperature on the critical velocity of
  water in pipes and find that the critical velocity varies directly with the viscosity
  of water. They use a resistance method and a range of temperatures from 4°C to 50°C
  to test the law, and their results are in substantial agreement with the equations
  of motion.
