revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Nebulae and Their Classification
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Observational Astronomy
tldr: The author, William Huggins, investigates the spectra of various nebulae and
  clusters using a prism and telescope. He observes that some nebulae produce a continuous
  spectrum, while others display one, two, or three bright lines. Huggins also attempts
  to determine the intrinsic intensity of the light emitted by some gaseous nebulae,
  suggesting that they may be the hottest objects in the category of nebulae and clusters.
