revised_title: Microscopic Observations on Chalky Tubulous Concretions and Farina
  of the Red Lily
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates chalky tubulous concretions called Malm and examines
  the farina of the red lily through a microscope. He suggests that Malm may form
  by enclosing and investing pieces of wood with additional layers, while the farina
  of the red lily ejects small globules in a continuous train.
