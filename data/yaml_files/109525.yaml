revised_title: Algebraic Expression for Portions of Solidity of a Sphere
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Topology
tldr: Robert Woodhouse presents a theorem that assigns portions of a sphere's solidity
  using algebraic expressions. He transforms the sphere's coordinates to simplify
  the integration process, making it less complicated than Viviani's problem.
