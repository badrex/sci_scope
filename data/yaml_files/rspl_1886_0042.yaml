revised_title: A New Stereoscopic Viewing Method for Enhanced Image Perception
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering
tldr: The author invents a new form of stereoscope that uses revolving disks and the
  persistence of vision to project two overlapping images onto a screen, creating
  a 3D effect for two viewers. This method allows for larger images and eliminates
  the need for lenses or prisms, potentially enhancing the viewing experience.
