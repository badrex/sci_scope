revised_title: Influence of Galvanic Current on Motor Nerve Excitability in Humans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of galvanic current on the excitability
  of human motor nerves. The researchers found that the anodic current decreased excitability,
  while the cathodic current increased it. They also discovered that the testing and
  polarizing currents had a mixed polar action on the nerves, with both anodic and
  cathodic influences present.
