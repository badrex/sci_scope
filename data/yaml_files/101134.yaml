tldr: Dr. Johnstons observes gold-colored stones found in various animals, such as
  dogs, hogs, and cows. These stones are smooth, spherical, and have a shell-like
  outer layer that gives them their golden hue. The inner substance resembles brown
  sugar candy. The stones dissolve in strong acids but maintain their color.
