revised_title: Investigation of Steam Vessel Motion Laws
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Fluid Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the laws governing the motion of steam vessels, focusing
  on paddle wheel design and resistance. Experiments are conducted on various vessels,
  and the author concludes that resistance is nearly proportional to the square of
  the velocity, providing valuable insights for steam navigation improvement.
