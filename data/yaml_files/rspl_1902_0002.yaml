revised_title: Magnetism and Resistivity Changes in Drawn Steel
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the changes in magnetism, resistivity, elasticity, and
  density in drawn steel as it is subjected to fluctuations in temperature. The study
  reveals that drawing affects the temperature coefficient of a magnet, and that resistivity,
  elasticity, and density all increase with drawing up to a certain point, after which
  extreme drawing causes a rapid increase in resistivity and a sharp diminution in
  elasticity.
