scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobotany & Plant Evolution
tldr: The author examines three specimens of Neuropteris heterophylla, each containing
  a large Rhabdocarpous seed. These specimens reveal that the previously described
  fructification is actually the male inflorescence of the plant. Neuropteris heterophylla
  is identified as a typical member of the Cycadofilices, and the specimens were found
  in the middle coal measures of the South Staffordshire coal field.
