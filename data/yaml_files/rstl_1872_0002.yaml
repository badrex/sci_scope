tldr: 'The author reports on a magnetic survey conducted in the east of France in
  1869, providing data on the magnetic dip, geographical coordinates, and the use
  of magnetic needles at various stations. The study aims to determine the inclination
  of the isoclinals to the prime meridian and their distance apart, with the most
  probable values of the three unknowns being 5= 0.5*7816, # = 0.0028495, and y =
  -0.0107 928.'
