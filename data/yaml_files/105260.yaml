scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences
tldr: The author observes a unique, faint, half-circle arch of colors in the sky after
  sunset, which he attributes to the sun's rays reflecting off tiny particles of evening
  vapors and smoke. This phenomenon, which he calls a "nocturnal solar iris," is unlike
  a rainbow and occurs in the absence of rain.
