revised_title: The Lymphatic Heart of the Eel and its Influence on Blood Flow
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the caudal heart of the eel, a lymphatic heart, and
  its effect on blood flow in the caudal vein. The heart's force propels lymph into
  the vein, temporarily stopping blood flow and causing red blood cells to aggregate.
  This process accelerates and promotes the flow of blood back to the blood-heart,
  demonstrating the secondary function of the lymphatic heart in eels.
