tldr: Sir Everard Home discovers the ovum in the human uterus and provides evidence
  against the commonly held belief that menstruation is a necessary step for utero-gestation.
  He also disproves the notion that the corpus luteum is the result of impregnation,
  showing it to be a glandular structure where the ovum is formed.
