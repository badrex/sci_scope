revised_title: Influence of Galvanic Current on Motor Nerve Excitability in Humans
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of galvanic current on the excitability
  of human motor nerves. The researchers found that the excitatory effect of an induction
  current increases during the passage of a galvanic current in the same direction
  and decreases during its passage in the opposite direction. These findings provide
  insights into the physiological changes in nerve excitability and the role of galvanic
  currents in nerve function.
