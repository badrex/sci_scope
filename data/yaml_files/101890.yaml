revised_title: The Sentiments of Dr. John Wallis on the Apparent Magnitude of the
  Sun Near the Horizon
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Dr. John Wallis discusses the apparent magnitude of the Sun near the horizon
  and how visual perception and distance estimation play a role in our understanding
  of its size. He explains that the Sun's apparent diameter taken by an instrument
  near the horizon is the same as when it is higher, and the difference in size is
  due to our imagination and perception of distance.
