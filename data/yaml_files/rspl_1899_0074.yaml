revised_title: 'Further Observations on Nitragin and the Nodules of Leguminous Plants:
  Anatomical and Experimental Study'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the anatomy and functions of nodules in leguminous plants,
  focusing on the role of 'nitragin' and its effects on plant growth. They conduct
  various experiments, including bacterial cultures and crop cultivation, to understand
  the complex relationship between the host plant and the nodule organisms.
topics:
- Nitragin
- Nodules of Leguminous Plants
- Microscopic Observations
- Bacterial Cultures
- Plant-Microbe Interactions
