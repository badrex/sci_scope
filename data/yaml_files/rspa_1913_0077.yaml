  Tetrachlorides'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the spectroscopic properties of nitrogen compounds formed
  by silicon and titanium tetrachlorides. They discover that silicon tetrachloride
  produces a nitride of silicon, while titanium tetrachloride does not show any spectrum
  attributable to a nitride. The study provides insights into the chemical behavior
  of these compounds and their interactions with active nitrogen.
