  on Isolated Muscle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pharmacology
tldr: This study compares the physiological effectiveness of alcohol, ether, and chloroform
  on isolated frog muscles, measuring the rate at which contractility is abolished
  in various solution strengths. The results provide insight into the comparative
  power of these narcotics and the degree of accuracy achievable through systematic
  experimentation.
