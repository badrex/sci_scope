revised_title: Theoretical Continuity in the Transition from Liquid to Gaseous State
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author discusses the concept of theoretical continuity in the transition
  from the liquid to the gaseous state, proposing that there may be a continuous path
  between these states, even though there is a practical breach of continuity at the
  boiling or condensing points.
topics:
- Phase Transitions
- Critical Points
- Boiling and Condensing
- Fluid Dynamics
- Thermodynamics
