revised_title: The Impact of Temperature-Dependent Coefficient of Dilatation on Earth
  Straining
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The authors analyze the effect of temperature-dependent coefficient of dilatation
  on the straining of the Earth due to secular cooling. They argue that previous calculations
  regarding the insufficiency of the contraction theory to produce mountain ranges
  are inadmissible.
