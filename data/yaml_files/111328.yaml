tldr: This paper presents the results of a five-year investigation into the moon's
  diurnal influence on the horizontal and vertical components of magnetic force at
  Toronto. The study confirms the moon's magnetic influence on Earth, with distinct
  variations in declination, inclination, and total force observed. The findings support
  the hypothesis that the moon's magnetism is derived, in part, from the Earth's magnetism.
