revised_title: Investigating Stream-line Motion in Curved Pipes
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulic Engineering
tldr: The authors conduct experiments using colored water and specially designed glass
  tubes to study the behavior of stream-line motion in curved pipes. They observe
  that stream filaments break up and follow the walls of the pipe, and that the effect
  of increasing velocity is to increase the curvature of the filaments. The results
  provide insight into the flow of water in curved pipes and have implications for
  engineering applications.
