  of Timber'

scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The author, William Thompson, refutes the claim that Teredo navalis, a destructive
  marine animal, is no longer found on the British coast. He presents evidence of
  specimens found in Portpatrick and discusses their method of consuming and destroying
  timber. Additionally, he describes the Limnoria terebrans, another crustacean that
  causes extensive damage to wood, often working alongside the Teredo navalis.
