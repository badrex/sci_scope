revised_title: Photographic Spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author successfully obtains a photograph of the spectrum of the great nebula
  in Orion, extending from a to beyond M in the ultra-violet. The photograph shows
  a spectrum of bright lines and a narrower continuous spectrum, which the author
  believes is due to stellar light. A new, relatively strong line in the ultra-violet
  is discovered, which appears to correspond to a line in the typical spectrum of
  white stars.
