revised_title: Effects of Pressure on Excitable Tissues and the Influence of Stress
  and Strain on the Physical Properties of Matter
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on excitable tissues, such as
  frog and tortoise hearts, and finds that neither the heart's rhythm nor the nerve's
  excitability is affected by pressures up to 150 atmospheres. Additionally, the author
  examines the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties of matter,
  including the effects of magnetization on the elasticity and internal friction of
  metals.
