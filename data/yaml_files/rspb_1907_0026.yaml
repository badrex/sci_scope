revised_title: 'Reciprocal Innervation of Antagonistic Muscles: Tenth Note'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between antagonistic muscles and their
  reciprocal innervation through reflex action. They find that stimulating afferent
  nerves from a muscle can cause reflex relaxation of that muscle and concurrent contraction
  of its antagonistic muscles, demonstrating the complex interplay between muscles
  in the body.
