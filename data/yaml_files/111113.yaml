revised_title: Experimental Researches on the Possible Relation of Gravity to Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: Michael Faraday investigates the potential connection between gravity and electricity
  by conducting experiments using a metal, glass, or resin cylinder and a helix of
  wire. Despite his efforts, he finds no traces of electric action that could be attributed
  to the power of gravity.
