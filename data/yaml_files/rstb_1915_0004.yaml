revised_title: 'The Excitatory Process in the Dog''s Heart: Part II - The Ventricles'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: This study by Thomas Lewis and M. A. Rothschild investigates the excitatory
  process in the dog's heart, focusing on the ventricles. They analyze the complex
  spread of the excitatory process and the role of the Purkinje system, concluding
  that previous methods of investigation were insufficient to understand the natural
  excitation wave in the heart.
