scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author examines plant growth, light direction, and leaf orientation, investigating
  the mechanisms behind tendril curling, stem bending, and leaf turning. The study
  concludes that these phenomena are not solely due to physical attractions or light
  influences, but rather involve complex interactions between vital irritability,
  chemical agents, and environmental factors.
