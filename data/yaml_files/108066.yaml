scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author presents a new method in dynamics that reduces the study of free
  systems of attracting or repelling points to the search and differentiation of a
  central relation or characteristic function. This method simplifies the integration
  of equations and offers a new approach to solving complex dynamical problems.
