revised_title: Electrochemical Decomposition of Earths and Formation of Metals from
  Alkaline Earths and Ammonia
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Humphry Davy conducts electrochemical research on the decomposition of earths,
  focusing on alkaline earths and ammonia. He discovers that when these substances
  are acted upon by a voltaic battery, they can form metallic alloys and decompose
  water. Davy also successfully repeats an experiment by Berzelius and Pontin, decomposing
  ammonia into a soft amalgam.
