tldr: The study investigates the morphology and susceptibility of the Liwonde strain
  of trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland. The researchers found that the
  trypanosome was similar in appearance to other strains and had varying lengths and
  breadths. They also observed the susceptibility of animals like monkeys, dogs, and
  rats to the disease, with different rates of infection and severity.
