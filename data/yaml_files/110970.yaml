revised_title: The Role of Tribasic Phosphate of Soda in Arterialization and Respiration
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes in blood during the process of
  arterialization and respiration. He discovers that the venous corpuscles contain
  a compound of fat and phosphorus, which, upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen, forms
  tribasic phosphate of soda, responsible for the arterial blood's bright tint.
