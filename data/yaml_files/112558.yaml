revised_title: 'Improvements in Observing Atmospheric Electricity: The Pendulum-Electrograph'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author describes the development and use of a pendulum-electrograph to continuously
  observe atmospheric electricity at the Melbourne Observatory. The device records
  the electric state of the air and provides a more efficient method of observing
  rapid changes in atmospheric electricity compared to previous methods.
