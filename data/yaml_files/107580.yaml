scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author describes the construction and use of a new thermometrical barometer
  for measuring altitudes with greater accuracy and convenience than a common barometer.
  The instrument is based on the variations in heat of boiling water corresponding
  to changes in atmospheric pressure and height of the barometer.
