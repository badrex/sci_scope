revised_title: The Formation of Hexosephosphate by Yeast Juice and Phosphate
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the formation of hexosephosphate during the fermentation
  of glucose, fructose, and mannose by yeast juice and phosphate. They find that the
  inorganic phosphate is converted into an organic compound, hexosephosphate, which
  can be isolated as a lead salt and analyzed for its composition and properties.
