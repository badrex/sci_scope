revised_title: On the Multiplication and Coloring of Images in Calcareous Spar
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of image multiplication and coloration
  in calcareous spar, discovering that the interrupting plane is not a fissure or
  fracture and that the colors are analogous to those produced by the action of crystals
  on polarized light. This explanation allows for the reproduction of the phenomena
  in artificial specimens, providing insights for mineralogists and natural philosophers
  alike.
