scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author examines the spectra of various nebulae and fixed stars, discovering
  that their light consists of three distinct refrangibilities. This finding challenges
  the idea that these celestial bodies are clusters of stars and suggests that they
  are instead massive luminous gases or vapors.
