scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author, George Graham, describes his observations and experiments with a
  dipping needle, a device used to measure the Earth's magnetic dip angle. He discusses
  the challenges of accurately measuring the dip and the effects of external factors,
  such as nearby iron objects, on the needle's behavior.
