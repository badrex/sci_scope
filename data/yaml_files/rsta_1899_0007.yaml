revised_title: A New Method for Observing Ionic Velocities
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author discusses the history and methods of studying ionic velocities, focusing
  on the limitations of previous techniques and proposing a new method using electrolytic
  jellies and visible moving boundaries to observe ion movement. The new method aims
  to avoid sources of error and provide more accurate results for comparison with
  calculated velocities.
