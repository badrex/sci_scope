revised_title: A Method for Eliminating Errors of Adjustment in Delicate Spectral
  Observations
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author proposes a method for eliminating errors in adjusting delicate observations
  of compared spectra by using a slit-reverser, a small apparatus that reverses the
  light without reversing the spectroscope, allowing for more accurate comparisons.
