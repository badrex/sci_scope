revised_title: Investigating the Relative Behaviour of Calcium Spectrum Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of calcium spectrum lines, particularly
  the H and K lines, under various conditions in the laboratory. They find that as
  the density of calcium vapor decreases, the intensity of other lines, such as the
  strong blue line, reduces relatively to H and K. This simplified spectrum is similar
  to what is observed in solar prominences and may provide insights into solar and
  stellar phenomena.
