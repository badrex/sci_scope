revised_title: Isolation and Identification of Nucleic Acid Derivatives from Peat
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors isolate and identify nucleic acid derivatives, specifically adenine-uracil
  dinucleotides, from peat. They also identify the presence of guanine and cytosine
  in the peat extract. The study provides insight into the composition of nucleic
  acids in raw peat and their potential role in plant growth.
