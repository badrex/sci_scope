revised_title: Experimental Evidence of the Repulsive Power of Heat
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the repulsive power of heat using glass lenses and observes
  that the separation between the surfaces is greater than can be explained by the
  change in figure due to heat. This suggests a real repulsive action between the
  surfaces of the glasses caused by the power of heat.
