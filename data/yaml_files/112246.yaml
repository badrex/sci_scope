revised_title: Further Investigations on the Chemical Composition of Lichens
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of two lichen varieties, Roccella
  tinctoria and Roccella fucifornis, focusing on their proximate principles and the
  formation of erythrin, orsellinic acid, and erythroglucine. The study confirms Dr.
  Schunck's hypothesis regarding the relationship between these compounds and provides
  insights into their formation and properties.
