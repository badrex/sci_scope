  of Invertebrate Fluids

tldr: The author investigates the coalescence of amoeboid cells into plasmodia and
  the coagulation of invertebrate fluids in various invertebrates. The study reveals
  that the clot formation in invertebrate fluids is mainly due to the fusion of finely
  granular amoeboid cells, and the process is similar to the formation of plasmodia
  in Myxomycetes.
