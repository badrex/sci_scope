revised_title: Corpuscular Radiation in Vapours by Homogeneous X-Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the corpuscular radiation produced in various vapours
  by homogeneous X-radiation. They use a mixture of gases and vapours, such as hydrogen,
  hydrochloric acid, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, to study the ionization
  and absorption of radiation. They find that the insulation difficulties can be overcome
  by covering the vulcanite with paraffin wax.
