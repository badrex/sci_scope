revised_title: 'The Transparent Rings on Herring Scales: A New Method for Age Determination'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ichthyology & Fisheries Science
tldr: The authors investigate the growth rings on herring scales and find that the
  transparent rings mark recurring periods of minimum growth, providing an index of
  the fish's age. They also introduce a new method for age determination using polarized
  light, which offers a valuable check on the reading of scales by ordinary light.
