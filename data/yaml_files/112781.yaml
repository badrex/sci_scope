revised_title: 'Physiological Changes Induced by Climate Shifts: A Study on Tropical
  and Extra-Tropical Climates'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Human Physiology & Adaptation
tldr: The author investigates the physiological changes that occur in humans when
  transitioning from temperate to tropical climates, focusing on respiration rates
  and lung capacity. The study finds that lung capacity increases in tropical climates,
  suggesting that humans adapt to the higher temperatures and humidity.
