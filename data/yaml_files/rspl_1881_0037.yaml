revised_title: Effects of Ammonia Salts and Hydrocyanic Acid on Muscle and Nerve
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of ammonia salts and hydrocyanic acid on
  muscle and nerve stimulation. The results show that these substances cause prolonged
  contractions and increased viscosity in muscle fibers, while also affecting the
  latency and excitability of nerves.
