  Nerve-Cells of the Spinal Cord and Encephalon

tldr: The author examines the internal structure and connections of caudate nerve
  cells in the spinal cord and brain, observing lines of granules that indicate the
  paths taken by nerve currents. This evidence supports the existence of complete
  nervous circuits and challenges the traditional view of nerve-force radiating from
  a central cell.
