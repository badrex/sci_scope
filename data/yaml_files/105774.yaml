scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: The author presents a new method for comparing curvilinear areas, which can
  be used to analyze the motion of objects with variable forces. This method involves
  using geometric formulas and limits to calculate the area under various curves,
  providing a valuable tool for mathematicians and scientists.
