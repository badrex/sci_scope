tldr: This paper examines the stability of a spherical nebula, exploring the differences
  between liquid and gaseous states and the role of gravity, elasticity, and rotation
  in maintaining equilibrium. The author also discusses the implications of these
  factors on the formation and behavior of meteorite swarms.
