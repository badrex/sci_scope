scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a new approach to the study of curves of the third order,
  establishing a fundamental identity and deriving various geometrical theorems. He
  also investigates the points on a cubic through which an infinity of cubics with
  a nine-point contact can be drawn.
