revised_title: On the Characteristics of Tropical and Extra-Tropical Cyclones
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The authors examine the characteristics and differences between tropical and
  extra-tropical cyclones, including their formation, behavior, and impact on weather
  patterns. They find that while both types of cyclones share general features, their
  specific characteristics are influenced by factors such as latitude, surrounding
  pressure, and the balance between rotational and translational energy.
