revised_title: Investigating the Effect of Temperature on Specific Gravities and the
  Development of a Method for Reducing them to a Common Standard
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author examines the impact of temperature on specific gravities and develops
  a method to reduce them to a common standard. The study reveals that the expansion
  of water is not proportional to the degrees of heat, and specific gravities of solids
  vary depending on temperature. A new method is proposed to correct for these discrepancies
  and accurately determine the weight of substances.
topics:
- Specific Gravities
- Temperature Effects
- Hydrostatic Weighing
- Heat Expansion
- Temperature Correction
