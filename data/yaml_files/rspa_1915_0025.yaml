revised_title: Third Order Approximation of Deep Water Waves
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Oceanography
tldr: The author investigates deep water waves, both progressive and stationary, using
  a mathematical approach. They derive equations to describe the wave behavior and
  find that the surface conditions determine whether the waves are progressive or
  stationary. The study provides a third-order approximation of these waves, which
  can be useful for understanding oceanic phenomena.
