tldr: This article discusses two sudden squalls that occurred on October 30th and
  November 21st, 1863. The author, Balfour Stewart, analyzes the rapid changes in
  atmospheric pressure, temperature, and electrical charge recorded at Kew Observatory
  and compares them to observations from the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford. The
  study reveals a correlation between the rapid rise of the barometer, increased wind
  velocity, and negative electrical charge in the air during these squalls.
