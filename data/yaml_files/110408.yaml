  Nerves'

scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: Sir Charles Bell investigates the functions of different parts of the brain
  and the relationship between the brain and nerves of motion and sensation. He discovers
  two columns in the cerebrum, one for voluntary motion and the other for sensation.
  These columns decussate in the medulla oblongata, explaining the phenomena of loss
  of sensation and motion following brain injuries.

- Neuroanatomy
- Brain Structure
- Nerve Function
- Decussation of Nerves
- Sensory and Motor Systems
