revised_title: Investigating the Power of Iron Masses to Control Magnetic Attraction
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author conducts experiments to understand the effects of iron masses on
  magnetic attraction and discovers that iron can neutralize the attractive force
  of a magnet. This phenomenon is explained by the screening effect, where iron acts
  as a barrier to the magnetic influence, and the neutralizing power of iron is related
  to its inductive energy.
