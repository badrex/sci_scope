revised_title: 'Scattering of Light by Dust-Free Air: Reproduction of Blue Sky'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the scattering of light by dust-free air and successfully
  reproduces the blue color of the sky in a laboratory setting. The experiment confirms
  that the blue color of the sky is primarily due to the scattering of light by air
  molecules, without the need for suspended particles.
