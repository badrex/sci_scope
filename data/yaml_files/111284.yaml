revised_title: 'Electro-Dynamic Properties of Metals: A Bakerian Lecture'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: In this Bakerian Lecture, William Thomson investigates the electro-dynamic properties
  of metals, focusing on electric convection, thermo-electric inversion, the effects
  of mechanical strain and magnetization on thermo-electric qualities, and the influence
  of various factors on electric conductivities of metals.
topics:
- Electromagnetism
- Thermoelectricity
