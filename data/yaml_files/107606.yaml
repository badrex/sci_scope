tldr: G. Dollond presents a new micrometer made of rock crystal that can be applied
  to telescopes for precise micrometrical measurements. The device offers advantages
  such as simplicity, ease of use, and the ability to take measurements without exchanging
  parts of the eye tube. The rock crystal's double refracting property allows for
  accurate measurements of angles and distances in astronomy and astrophysics.
