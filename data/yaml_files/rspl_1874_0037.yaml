scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Analysis
tldr: The author presents a method to evaluate the integrals of irrational algebraic
  quantities using linear differential equations with rational coefficients and converging
  series. The paper also discusses the inverse problem of determining when linear
  differential equations of the second order are satisfied by irrational functions
  and applies these principles to solve dynamical problems in mechanics.
