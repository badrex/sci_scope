revised_title: The Effect of Direct Current Magnetizing Force on High Permeability
  in Iron
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors investigate the effect of direct current magnetizing force on the
  permeability of iron alloys, specifically stalloy, and find that high maximum permeability
  can be achieved without the need for a special magnetic shield when cooling through
  the temperature at which it regains magnetic properties.
