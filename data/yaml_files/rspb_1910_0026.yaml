revised_title: The Localization of Hydrochloric Acid Production in Gastric Tubules
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Histology
tldr: This study investigates the origin of hydrochloric acid in gastric tubules using
  a modified version of Claude Bernard's method. The researchers found that parietal
  cells are responsible for acid production and that the acid is sometimes secreted
  directly into the cytoplasm, rather than into the canaliculi.
