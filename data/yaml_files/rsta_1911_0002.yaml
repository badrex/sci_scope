revised_title: The Elastic Limits of Iron and Steel under Cyclical Variations of Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The authors investigate the elastic limits of iron and steel under cyclical
  variations of stress, finding that the specimens can adjust themselves to the applied
  stress cycles, and that the elastic limits can be raised or lowered by repetitions
  of stress. The results provide insights into the fatigue and fracture of materials
  under cyclic loading.
