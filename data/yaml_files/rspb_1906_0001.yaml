scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the physical and chemical properties of chloroform solutions
  and their impact on anesthesia. The authors find that chloroform forms unstable
  compounds with proteins, and that anesthesia is due to the formation of these compounds,
  which limit the chemical activities of the protoplasm.
