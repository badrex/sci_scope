revised_title: 'On the Application of Harmonic Analysis to the Dynamical Theory of
  Tides: Part I'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Hydrology
tldr: The authors explore the application of harmonic analysis to the dynamical theory
  of tides, focusing on Laplace's oscillations of the first species and the dynamics
  of ocean currents. They derive equations for the ideal oscillations of the ocean
  and discuss the periods of free oscillation of zonal type, as well as the effects
  of varying depth and density on ocean currents.

- Tides
- Harmonic Analysis
