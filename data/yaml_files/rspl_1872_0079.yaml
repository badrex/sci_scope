revised_title: Synthesis and Properties of Normal Primary Heptyl Alcohol
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry
tldr: The authors describe the synthesis of normal primary heptyl alcohol from oenanthylic
  acid and cenanthol, and present its physical properties, including its boiling point
  and aromatic odor. They also compare its boiling point with other normal alcohols
  in a series, showing a regular increase for each additional CH2 group.
