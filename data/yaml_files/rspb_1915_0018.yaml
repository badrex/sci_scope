revised_title: 'Intracranial Ganglion on Oculomotor Nerve in Scyllium canicula: Implications
  for Cranial Nerve Segmentation'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author discovers a ganglion of unipolar or bipolar cells on the oculomotor
  nerve in Scyllium canicula, challenging the widely accepted belief that the oculomotor
  nerve is a purely motor nerve. The presence of these ganglia in different vertebrate
  classes raises questions about the homology of the oculomotor nerve and its relation
  to the ciliary ganglion.
