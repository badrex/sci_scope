revised_title: On the Development of a New Photometer for Measuring Luminous Intensity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author discusses the challenges of measuring the intensity of light and
  proposes a new photometer based on the chemical action of luminous rays. The new
  photometer would be an absolute measurement device, not requiring a standard light
  for comparison, and could potentially lead to more accurate illumination measurements.
