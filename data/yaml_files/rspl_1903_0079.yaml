revised_title: The Effect of Heat on the Resistance of Bacillus anthracis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Bacteriology
tldr: The authors investigate the resistance of Bacillus anthracis to heat and determine
  that it can be effectively killed at temperatures of 100Â°C for short periods of
  time. This finding is significant for the rapid and effective sterilization of water
  for troops in the field.
