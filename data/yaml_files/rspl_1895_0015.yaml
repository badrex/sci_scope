scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the gas obtained from uraninite using different methods
  and concludes that the gas is of complex origin. The author also compares the gas
  obtained from cleveite and broggerite, finding that both gases are complex and not
  as simple as previously thought.
