revised_title: An Experimental Inquiry on the Action of Electricity on Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Gas Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effects of electricity on oxygen gas using the induction
  tube of W. Siemens. The experiments reveal that oxygen undergoes a contraction in
  volume when exposed to electric action, and that ozone is produced by the action
  of the electric spark on pure and dry oxygen.
