revised_title: Investigating the Plasticity of Glacier Ice and its Impact on Glacier
  Motion
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Glaciology
tldr: The author examines the plasticity of glacier ice and its effect on glacier
  motion. By studying the geometry of glacier movement, the author concludes that
  the ice exhibits plasticity, which allows it to mold itself to the landscape and
  move more efficiently.
