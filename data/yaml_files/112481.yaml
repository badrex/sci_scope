revised_title: On a New Series of Bodies Homologous to Hydrocyanic Acid
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Isomerism
tldr: The author investigates a new series of bodies homologous to hydrocyanic acid,
  formed by the action of chloroform on primary monamines and the treatment of cyanide
  of silver with alcoholic iodides. These isomers have various properties and applications,
  including the generation of polycyanides and the potential existence of a series
  of bodies isomeric with the sulphocyanides.
