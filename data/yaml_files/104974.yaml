scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Hydrogeology
tldr: A letter from Edward Matthews describes the sudden sinking of a river near Pontypool
  in Monmouthshire, resulting in a chasm and the formation of new springs. The event
  is attributed to the collapse of a limestone bed due to the rapid flow of water,
  which also caused nearby pits to sink deeper and created new channels for the river.
