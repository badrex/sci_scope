revised_title: Thermal Deformation of Crystallized Normal Sulphates of Potassium,
  Rubidium, and Cesium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the thermal deformation of crystallized normal sulphates
  of potassium, rubidium, and cesium, discovering that their expansion is influenced
  by the atomic weight of the alkali metal. The study uses a new interference dilatometer
  to measure the expansion of the crystals, providing insights into their physical
  properties and chemical constitution.
