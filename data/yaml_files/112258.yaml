revised_title: On the Measurement of the Chemical Action of Direct and Diffuse Sunlight
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The authors, R. W. Bunsen and H. E. Roscoe, develop a method to measure the
  chemical action of direct and diffuse sunlight using photographic sensitized paper.
  They explore the factors affecting the sensitivity of the paper and the accuracy
  of the measurements, and present a method to compare shades of blackness produced
  by different intensities of light.
