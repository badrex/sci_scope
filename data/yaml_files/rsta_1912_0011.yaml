revised_title: 'On the Series of Sturm and Liouville: A New Approach Using Integral
  Equations'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Functional Analysis
tldr: The author presents a new approach to the Sturm-Liouville series by using integral
  equations instead of differential equations. The method involves approximating the
  function with a constant value in each sub-interval, leading to a more flexible
  and accurate solution.
topics:
- Stur
- Integral Equations
- Approximation Methods
- Harmonic Analysis
