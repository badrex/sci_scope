revised_title: Investigating the Influence of Chemical Composition on Electric Osmose
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author conducts experiments on electric osmose using various solutions and
  finds that the direction of osmotic flow is generally the same as the direction
  of the electric current. However, the chemical composition of the liquid can influence
  the osmotic flow, as seen in the case of a solution of barium bromide in absolute
  alcohol.
