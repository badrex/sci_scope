revised_title: The Strain Theory of Photographic Action and Its Implications
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Photochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the strain theory of photographic action, exploring
  the effects of light, electric radiation, and mechanical disturbance on sensitive
  substances. The study reveals the importance of molecular strain in modifying chemical
  activity and the potential for physical strain to produce photographic effects.
  The research also highlights the role of sensitization in preventing self-recovery
  and making after-effects more permanent.
