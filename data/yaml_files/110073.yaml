tldr: Dr. John Lewis Tiarks conducted two expeditions using chronometers to determine
  the longitude of Madeira and Falmouth. The results showed a discrepancy with the
  trigonometrical survey of Great Britain, leading to a reevaluation of the earth's
  ellipticity and the parallel circle diameter. The longitude of Falmouth was determined
  to be 20°11' of time, and that of the British Consul's garden at Funchal was 11°7'39"
  W of Greenwich.
