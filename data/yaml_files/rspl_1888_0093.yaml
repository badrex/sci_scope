scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Hematology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of fibrinogen on the blood and its potential
  role in cardiac diseases. They find that rapid injection of fibrinogen causes clotting
  and other changes in the blood, leading to conditions such as oedema and haemorrhage.
  The author suggests that fibrinogen intoxication may be a significant factor in
  various cardiac diseases, including valvular disease and obstruction to the circulation
  through the lungs.
