revised_title: An Experimental Investigation of the Relationship Between Applied Force,
  Velocity, and the Effectiveness of Machines
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine the relationship between the quantity
  and proportion of mechanical power needed to give different velocities to heavy
  objects. The study challenges the commonly held beliefs about the relationship between
  force, velocity, and the effectiveness of machines, providing practical insights
  for the improvement of mechanical engineering.
topics:
- Mechanical Power
- Velocity of Heavy Bodies
- Impulse and Momentum
