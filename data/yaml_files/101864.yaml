revised_title: A New Method to Determine the Velocity of Air Under Pressure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: Dr. Papin proposes a new method to determine the velocity of air under pressure
  using hydrostatic principles and the specific gravity of different liquids. He demonstrates
  that the velocity of air is 29 times greater than that of water under the same pressure.
