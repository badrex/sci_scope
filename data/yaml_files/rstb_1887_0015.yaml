revised_title: On the Homologies and Succession of Teeth in Dasyurid Marsupials and
  the Evolution of Mammalian Teeth

scientific_subdiscipline: Mammalogy & Vertebrate Zoology
tldr: The author investigates the homologies and succession of teeth in dasyurid marsupials,
  providing insights into the evolution of mammalian teeth. The study reveals that
  the last premolar is the tooth that has disappeared in certain dasyurid species,
  and suggests that this tooth reduction may be linked to the evolution of teeth in
  both marsupials and placental mammals.
