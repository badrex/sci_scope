tldr: This paper presents the diurnal inequalities of terrestrial magnetism observed
  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. The author analyzes the
  data from various magnetometers and describes the changes in declination, horizontal
  force, and vertical force over time. The findings reveal a significant change in
  the magnetism during the period 1848-1857, suggesting a possible connection to the
  Earth's interaction with the Sun.
