revised_title: Investigating the Nature and Qualities of Voltaic Currents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author, George Gore, investigates the nature and qualities of voltaic currents
  by experimenting with different battery configurations, voltameters, and galvanometers.
  He discovers that voltaic currents from different sources or under different external
  conditions can possess different qualities, and suggests that voltaic electricity
  may consist of vibrations or successive impulses.
