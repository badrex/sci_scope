revised_title: Effects of Heat on Certain Haloid Compounds of Silver, Mercury, Lead,
  and Copper
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of heat on haloid compounds of silver, mercury,
  lead, and copper, focusing on the anomalous behavior of iodide of silver. The study
  examines the expansion and contraction of these compounds at various temperatures
  and discusses their molecular constitution and physical properties.
topics:
- Thermal Expansion and Contraction
- Iodide of Silver
- Haloid Compounds
