revised_title: Investigating Unequal Electric Conduction-Resistance at Cathodes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The author investigates the resistance of cathodes of different metals to the
  passage of current and finds that different metals exhibit varying degrees of resistance.
  This resistance is not solely due to heat, current, or chemical action, and further
  research is needed to understand its nature and relation to various circumstances.
topics:
- Electrolysis
- Cathode Resistance
- Electromotive Force
- Tidal Streams
- Galvanic Action
