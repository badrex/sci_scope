tldr: Wanklyn and Robinson investigate the density of vapors given off when chemical
  compounds are heated, discovering that the apparent density can be different from
  the real density. They propose a method of diffusion analysis to distinguish between
  these two values, which involves diffusing the vapors through a simple aperture
  or short tube.
