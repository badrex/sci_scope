revised_title: 'Specific Heats of Gases at Constant Volume: Air, Carbon Dioxide, and
  Hydrogen'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: This study investigates the specific heats of air, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen
  at constant volume over various pressures and temperatures. The results show that
  the specific heats of these gases are not constant and vary with density. The findings
  are consistent with other experiments on gas properties and contribute to the understanding
  of how gases behave under different conditions.
