  on Form and Proportions'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Naval Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between a ship's form, dimensions,
  and material weight in the construction of iron-clad ships. The study shows that
  the proportions and form of a ship should be made dependent on the weight of the
  material used in its construction, and that as the armor thickness increases, the
  proportions of length to breadth should be diminished, and the waterlines increased
  in fullness. This can lead to greater economy and superior efficiency in certain
  classes of ships.
