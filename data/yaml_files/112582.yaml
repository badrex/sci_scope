revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Intensities of Direct Sunlight and Diffuse
  Daylight at Different Altitudes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Climate
tldr: This study investigates the chemical intensity of direct sunlight and diffuse
  daylight at various altitudes using sensitive paper and a method developed by the
  authors. The results show that the chemical action of direct sunlight becomes inappreciable
  at low altitudes, while the intensity of diffuse daylight remains considerable.
  The study also reveals that the atmosphere's action on chemically active solar rays
  is different from that on luminous rays.
