revised_title: A New Method for Determining Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Surface
  Absorption
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
tldr: The authors develop a new method for determining atmospheric carbon dioxide
  based on the rate of its absorption by a free surface of a solution of caustic alkali.
  They find that the rate of absorption is directly related to the partial pressure
  of the carbon dioxide in the air, and that the method provides accurate results
  when certain precautions are taken.
