revised_title: Internal Distribution of Matter and Gravitational Potential
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the internal distribution of matter within a mass that
  produces a given potential at its surface, focusing on the Earth as an example.
  The study explores the conditions under which the internal distribution can be widely
  different from the hypothesis of primitive fluidity and provides a general expression
  for the internal density.
topics:
- Gravitational Potential
- Mass Distribution
- Ellipsoidal Earth Model
- Geodesy
- Density Distribution
