revised_title: 'Investigations on the Spectrum of Magnesium: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of magnesium under various conditions,
  including different gases and temperatures, and find that the presence of oxygen
  significantly affects the appearance of the bands in the spectrum, suggesting that
  they are due to the oxide or the process of oxidation.
