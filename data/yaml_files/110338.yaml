revised_title: The Role of Bile in Digestion and Metabolism
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The author presents evidence to support the idea that bile pre-exists in the
  blood and that the liver's function is to separate this material. They also demonstrate
  that bile can be secreted from both arterial and venous blood and that chyle can
  be formed in the absence of bile. The author concludes that bile's primary function
  is not in chyle formation but serves another purpose in the digestive and metabolic
  processes.
