revised_title: Geometrical Construction of Oxygen Absorption Lines in the Solar Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the geometrical construction of oxygen absorption lines
  in the solar spectrum, using a micrometer and rectangular coordinates. The analysis
  reveals that the lines can be represented by parabolic curves, and the author provides
  formulas and tables for calculating the wave-lengths of the lines.
