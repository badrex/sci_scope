revised_title: Observations on the Physiology of the Cerebral Cortex in Higher Apes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the physiology of the cerebral cortex in higher apes,
  focusing on the motor area and its functions. They find that the motor area extends
  continuously along the precentral convolution and sulcus centralis, and that the
  arrangement of the representation of various body regions follows the craniospinal
  nerve sequence. They also observe epilepsy in the cortex of the anthropoids and
  discuss the effects of ablations in the precentral gyrus and post-central gyrus.
