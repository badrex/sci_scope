revised_title: Experimental Researches on Steam Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: Faraday investigates the evolution of electricity through the friction of water
  and steam against various surfaces. He discovers that the presence of water is essential
  for the development of electricity and that the shape and form of the passage significantly
  influence the excitation process.
