revised_title: A New Rheotome for Investigating Electrical Changes in Excitable Tissues
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurophysiology & Cardiology
tldr: The author presents a new instrument called the rheotome, which is designed
  to investigate the electrical changes in excitable tissues of plants and animals.
  The instrument allows for precise control and measurement of the time intervals
  between electrical stimulation and the resulting response, making it useful for
  studying the physiology of nerves, muscles, and cardiac tissue.
