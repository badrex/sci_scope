revised_title: 'On Hamilton''s Numbers: Part II and Asymptotic Development for Hypothenusal'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mathematical Analysis & Applied Mathematics
tldr: The authors continue their study of Hamilton's numbers and their asymptotic
  development, focusing on the half of any hypothenusal. They establish the law of
  indices and coefficients for these numbers and apply their findings to hydraulic
  problems involving pipe cross-sections and flow resistance.
