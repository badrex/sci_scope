revised_title: 'Endophytic Adaptation in Erysiphe Graminis DC: A Study on Fungal Infection
  and Penetration in Host-Plants'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Pathology & Mycology
tldr: This study investigates the endophytic adaptation of Erysiphe Graminis DC.,
  a fungus typically considered an ectoparasite, under cultural conditions. The research
  shows that the fungus can infect and penetrate host-plants' internal tissues, producing
  haustoria and conidiophores, suggesting the possibility of adaptation to endophytism
  under certain circumstances.
