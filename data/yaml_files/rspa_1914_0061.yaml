revised_title: Innovative Optophone for Reading by Sound
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors describe the development of a type-reading optophone, an instrument
  that enables blind individuals to read ordinary books and newspapers through sound.
  The optophone uses a siren disc, an optical arrangement, selenium or antimonite
  bridges, and a telephone receiver to convert light reflected from printed text into
  audible sounds, allowing users to recognize and read letters by their unique sound
  profiles.
