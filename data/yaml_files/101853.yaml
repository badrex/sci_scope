tldr: This article presents two separate observations of the lunar eclipse that occurred
  on November 30th, 1686, made by G. C. Eimmart and J. Ph. Wurtzelbaur in Nuremberg.
  Both observers recorded the beginning, total immersion, and end of the eclipse,
  as well as the Moon's apparent diameter while totally eclipsed. Their findings contribute
  to a better understanding of the eclipse's duration and the accuracy of their observations.
