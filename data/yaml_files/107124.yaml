revised_title: A New Method for Examining Refractive and Dispersive Powers Using Prismatic
  Reflection
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author presents a new method for examining the refractive and dispersive
  powers of various substances using prismatic reflection. This method allows for
  accurate comparison and measurement of refractive powers without the need for complex
  calculations or calculations involving the density of the substance under examination.
