revised_title: On the Superficial Viscosity of Water and its Relation to Surface Contamination
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The author investigates the superficial viscosity of water and its relation
  to surface contamination. He discusses Plateau's experiments and Marangoni's theories,
  concluding that the special resistance experienced by a needle rotating on a water
  surface is due to surface contamination and not an inherent property of water.
topics:
- Surface Viscosity
- Surface Tension
- Surface Contamination
- Marangoni Effect
- Plateau's Experiments
