revised_title: 'On the Forces Caused by the Communication of Heat Between a Surface
  and a Gas: A Study of the Light-Mill'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author investigates the forces caused by heat communication between a surface
  and a gas using a light-mill, a photometer invented by Dr. Geissler. The study confirms
  that the forces are due to the friction of air and provides evidence that the force
  is not directly related to radiation.
