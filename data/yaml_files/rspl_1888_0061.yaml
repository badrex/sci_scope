revised_title: On the Functional Unity of Protoplasmic Movement in Living Organisms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the movement of protoplasm in living organisms, including
  cells, and demonstrates that it is a spontaneous activity resulting from internal
  chemical processes. The author also explores the similarities between protoplasmic
  movement and muscle contractions, suggesting that both are driven by chemical transformations
  within the cell.
