scientific_discipline: Astronomy

tldr: The author, John Brinkley, discusses his observations of the parallax of certain
  fixed stars, specifically a Lyre, a Cygni, and an Aquilae. He expresses doubts about
  the fitness of the Greenwich mural circle instrument for such delicate inquiries
  and calls for further improvements in astronomical instruments to accurately measure
  the smaller motions of stars.
