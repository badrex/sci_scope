revised_title: Experiments on the Friction and Abrasion of Solid Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Tribology
tldr: The author, George Rennie, investigates the friction and abrasion of solid surfaces,
  focusing on the resistance arising from the displacement or rupture of the superficial
  asperities of bodies in motion. The study examines the effect of pressure, surface
  area, and velocity on friction and provides a comprehensive overview of previous
  research on the topic by notable philosophers and scientists.
