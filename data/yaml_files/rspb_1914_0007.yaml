  Differences in Tumour-Strains'

tldr: The authors investigate the presence of lipoid substances in transplantable
  tumours of mice and rats, finding significant quantitative and qualitative differences
  in lipoid composition between various tumour strains. Rapidly growing tumours show
  a marked increase in total lipoids, primarily due to an increase in non-phosphorised
  fats, while cholesterin and cholesterin esters are absent in some strains. The authors
  suggest that these differences may be related to the rate of growth and the biological
  characteristics of the tumour cells.
