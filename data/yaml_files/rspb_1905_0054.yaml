revised_title: Studies on the Specificity and Action of Lipase Enzymes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: This study investigates the action and specificity of lipase enzymes, particularly
  Ricinus lipase, which is found in germinating castor-oil plant seeds. The author
  explores the enzyme's preference for hydrolyzing natural fats and its dependence
  on the presence of acid. The findings have implications for understanding the differences
  between plant and animal lipases and the role of acids in enzyme action.
