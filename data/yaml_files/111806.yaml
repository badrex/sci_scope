revised_title: Experimental Determination of Aluminum's Position in the Voltaic Series
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Cells
tldr: Charles Wheatstone investigates the position of aluminum in the voltaic series
  and its electromotive properties. He finds that aluminum is more negative than zinc
  in the series and provides experimental results on its behavior with various solutions
  and metals.
