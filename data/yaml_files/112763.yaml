tldr: The author examines the organs of vision in the Common Mole, focusing on the
  eye and optic nerve structures. The study reveals that the eye is a small, black,
  and shining bead closely attached to the skin, and the optic nerve is extremely
  delicate and difficult to discern. The author also discusses the differences in
  eye structure between the adult and fetal Mole, as well as the various opinions
  of anatomists on the topic.
