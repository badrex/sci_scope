revised_title: Magnetisation and the Length of Iron Wires under Tension
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetisation on the length of iron wires
  under tension and finds that the critical magnetising force required for elongation
  decreases as the tension increases. The results suggest that magnetisation can cause
  retraction instead of elongation under certain conditions.
