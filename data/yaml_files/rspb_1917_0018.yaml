revised_title: Correlating Germicidal Action with Selective Absorption in Ultra-Violet
  Radiation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the germicidal action of ultra-violet radiation and
  its correlation with selective absorption. They find that the most effective germicidal
  portion of the ultra-violet spectrum is between 2940 to 2380 Angstrom units, and
  that this region corresponds almost exactly with the portion of the spectrum absorbed
  by the bacterial emulsion.
