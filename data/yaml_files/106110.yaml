tldr: The author examines five ancient Persian coins from Palestine or Phoenicia,
  dating back to before the dissolution of the Persian Empire. He discusses the religious
  iconography on the coins, specifically the deity Atergatis or Derceto, and provides
  evidence that these coins were struck in Ascalon, a city in Palestine. The author
  also speculates on the possible date of the coins and the meaning of the Phoenician
  letters on them.
