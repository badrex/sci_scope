  and Other Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Ichthyology
tldr: The author investigates the structure and development of the chorda dorsalis
  in various fish species, particularly plagiostomes, and examines its role in the
  formation of vertebral bodies. The study reveals the process of ossification and
  cartilage formation, as well as the involvement of the outer ossifying layer in
  the development of vertebral bodies.
