scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author compares simultaneous magnetic disturbances at various observatories,
  emphasizing the importance of adopting consistent scale values for instruments to
  improve the study of terrestrial magnetism. The author also discusses the application
  of Gaussian analysis to these disturbances and the need for more comprehensive global
  observations.
