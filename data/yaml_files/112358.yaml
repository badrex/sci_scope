revised_title: On the Decomposition of Nitrite of Amyl by Light
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of nitrite of amyl using both electric
  light and sunlight, discovering that the more refrangible rays are the most chemically
  active. The study sheds light on the relationship between a liquid and its vapor,
  as well as the mechanism of absorption in molecular physics.
