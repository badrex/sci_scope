scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurology & Neuroscience
tldr: The study investigates the effects of cerebral anaemia and ligation of the cerebral
  arteries on various animals, including rabbits, cats, dogs, and monkeys. It explores
  the relationship between posture, blood circulation, and brain function, as well
  as the recovery process after ligation. The research also examines the role of the
  cortex cerebri in convulsions and the origin of tonus.
