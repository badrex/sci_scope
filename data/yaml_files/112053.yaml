revised_title: Isolation and Properties of Colloid Acid in Human Urine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical & Biochemistry
tldr: The author, William Marcet, describes the extraction and properties of a colloid
  acid found in human urine. He explains the process of isolating the acid using animal
  charcoal and precipitation with lead salts. The colloid acid is found to be rich
  in carbon and poor in hydrogen, and it has unique properties such as being slow
  to decompose and hygroscopic. The author also discusses the formation of various
  compounds with the colloid acid and its potential physiological significance.
