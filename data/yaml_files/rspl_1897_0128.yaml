scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: Karl Pearson develops a mathematical theory of ancestral heredity, which improves
  upon and reconciles previous theories by Galton. This theory allows for the prediction
  of correlation coefficients in heredity and forms the foundation for understanding
  the influence of ancestry on offspring characteristics.
