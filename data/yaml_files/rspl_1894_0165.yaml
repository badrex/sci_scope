  Inquiry into Measurable Characteristics'

scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Ecology
tldr: The study investigates the death rate of crabs (Carcinus maenas) due to selective
  destruction based on their frontal breadth dimensions. The research finds that the
  death rate is a function of the deviation from the mean frontal breadth, with a
  total death rate of approximately 77,000 between the age corresponding to 7 mm in
  carapace length and maturity.
