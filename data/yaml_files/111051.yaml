tldr: The author presents a new method for analyzing numerical equations by decomposing
  them into conjugate factors and using rejective intervals to reduce the search space
  for roots. This method is demonstrated through examples from Sturm, Fourier, and
  other mathematicians, and also provides criteria for the existence of imaginary
  roots in equations.
