tldr: This case study examines a woman who experienced a rare condition where a large
  amount of fluid accumulated within the outer layer of her uterus, causing her to
  appear pregnant. The condition was eventually diagnosed through a post-mortem examination,
  which revealed the presence of a thin, transparent membrane containing the fluid.
  The woman's symptoms, including breast discharge and menstrual suppression, had
  led to a misdiagnosis of pregnancy.
