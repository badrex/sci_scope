revised_title: 'On the Solubility of Solids in Gases: A Study of Critical Points'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the solubility of solids in gases by examining the behavior
  of various solutions at their critical points. They develop a pressure apparatus
  to study these phenomena and find that solids dissolve in gases even above their
  critical points, challenging the notion that solubility is a property exclusive
  to liquids.

- Chemical Solubility
