revised_title: Investigating the Construction of the Heavens and Discovering New Nebulae
  and Clusters of Stars
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Observational Astronomy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: William Herschel describes his observations using a 20-foot telescope, resolving
  nebulae and clusters of stars into individual stars. He discovers 466 new nebulae
  and clusters of stars, which he plans to present in separate catalogues to the Royal
  Society. This work provides a new view of the heavens, as the stars and nebulae
  are arranged in strata, suggesting a three-dimensional structure rather than a flat,
  spherical surface.
