revised_title: Conjectures on Electricity and the Rise of Vapours
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Atmospheric Chemistry
tldr: The author explores the relationship between electricity and the rise of vapors,
  suggesting that air particles are electric and play a role in the phenomena of light
  production and vapor formation. He also proposes that the interaction between air
  and sulfur can explain the loss of elasticity in air when mixed with sulfurous vapors.
