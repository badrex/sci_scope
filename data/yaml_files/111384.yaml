revised_title: Experimental Investigation of the Resistance of Flexure in Beams
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Structural Engineering
tldr: The author conducts experiments on various beam forms to investigate the resistance
  of flexure, a previously overlooked element of strength in beams subjected to transverse
  strain. The results show that flexural resistance is evenly distributed over the
  surface and is due to lateral cohesion between adjacent surfaces of fibers or particles.
  The author also determines the relationship between straining and resisting forces
  in different beam sections.

- Beam Strength
- Flexural Resistance
- Tensile Strength
