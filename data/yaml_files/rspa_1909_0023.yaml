revised_title: Statistical Analysis of Black Body Radiation Oscillation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics
tldr: The author investigates the statistical form of the curve of oscillation for
  radiation emitted by a black body, using a statistical approach to analyze the distribution
  of energy in the spectrum and the characteristics of the disturbance in the radiation.
topics:
- Black Body Radiation
- Statistical Analysis
- Wave Length Distribution
- Energy Distribution
