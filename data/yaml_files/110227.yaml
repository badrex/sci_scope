revised_title: Investigation of Sound Velocity and Comparison with Dulong's Experiments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: Dr. Simons investigates the velocity of sound, comparing it with M. Dulong's
  experiments and the observations of Drs. Moll and Van Beek. By applying corrections
  to Laplace's formula, the computed velocities of sound are closer to the observed
  velocities, and the remaining differences are likely due to unavoidable errors in
  such complex observations.
