scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: This study by Philip Henry Gosse investigates the poison-apparatus in Actiniadae,
  focusing on the cnidocytes found in sea anemones. Gosse identifies four distinct
  forms of cnidocytes and examines their structure, function, and the mechanism of
  their venomous discharge. He also discusses the potential venomous properties of
  the fluid within the cnidocytes and its effects on various organisms.
