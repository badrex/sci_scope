revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Reactions and Storage Capacity of Storage
  Batteries
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical reactions occurring during the charging
  and discharging of storage batteries, specifically focusing on the role of lead
  sulphate and the electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric acid. The study provides a
  method to estimate the charge in a storage cell without discharging it, contributing
  to a better understanding of storage battery performance and capacity.
