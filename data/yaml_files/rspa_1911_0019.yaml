revised_title: The Origin of Magnetic Storms and Sunspot Periodicity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the origin of magnetic storms and the periodicity of
  sunspots, concluding that the connection between solar outbursts and terrestrial
  magnetism is due to increased ionization of the atmosphere, allowing electromotive
  forces to increase the intensity of electric circulation.
