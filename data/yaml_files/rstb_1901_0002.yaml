  of Connecting Threads in the Tissues of Pinus sylvestris and Other Allied Species'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Botany
tldr: This article investigates the histology of the cell wall, specifically the distribution
  and character of connecting threads in the tissues of Pinus sylvestris and other
  related species. The authors examine the structure of germinating seeds and young
  plants, focusing on the endosperm, cotyledons, hypocotyl, and root. They also discuss
  the importance of connecting threads in endosperm, which play a role in the transport
  of nutrients and ferments to the developing embryo.
