revised_title: Investigating the Rolling Motion of a Cylinder
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics &amp; Dynamics
tldr: The author, Henry Moseley, investigates the rolling motion of a cylinder and
  its pressure on a horizontal plane. The study includes the time occupied by a heterogeneous
  cylinder in rolling through any given space, the time occupied in its oscillation
  through any given arc, and its pressure while rolling. The findings have practical
  applications to the theory of pendulums and the stability of locomotive engines.
