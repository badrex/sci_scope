revised_title: 'Enzyme Action and the Ionic-Dissociation Hypothesis: Implications
  for Vital Change'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical & Theoretical Chemistry
tldr: The author argues against the ionic-dissociation hypothesis and advocates for
  an association hypothesis in explaining enzyme action and chemical changes. The
  role of the solvent and residual affinity in electrolysis and chemical change is
  discussed, emphasizing the importance of considering these factors in understanding
  vital change.
topics:
- Enzyme action
- Ionic-dissociation hypothesis
- Chemical change
- Solvent role in electrolysis
- Selective enzyme action
