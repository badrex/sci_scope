revised_title: The Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism and Its Connection with
  Atmospheric Oscillations
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and finds
  that it has its origin outside the Earth's surface. The study suggests that electric
  currents in the upper regions of the atmosphere cause the variation, and proposes
  a connection between the barometric and magnetic changes. The author also discusses
  the possible role of solar radiation in increasing atmospheric conductivity.
