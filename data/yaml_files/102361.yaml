revised_title: 'A New Chemical Reaction: Red Color Produced by Mixing Sulphureous
  Spirit with Volatile Alcali'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Synthesis
tldr: Edward Coles describes a chemical experiment where mixing a sulphureous spirit
  with a volatile alcali, such as spirit of sal armoniack or urine, produces a red
  color. This discovery could be useful in demonstrating sanguification and was presented
  to the Royal Society.
