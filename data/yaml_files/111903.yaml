  and Its Derivatives'

scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: Peter Griess investigates the reproduction of non-nitrogenous acids from amidic
  acids, specifically focusing on salylic acid and its derivatives. He discovers that
  salylic acid is the true representative of acetic acid in the group of aromatic
  acids and that similar isomerisms may exist in the group of fatty acids.
