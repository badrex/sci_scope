revised_title: Instantaneous Photography of Liquid Surface Impacts
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Surface Phenomena
tldr: The authors use instantaneous photography to study the impact of a liquid surface,
  providing detailed information on the formation and behavior of splashes. They describe
  their experimental setup and techniques, including the use of a Leyden-jar discharge
  to illuminate the splash, and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding
  the physics of splashes.
