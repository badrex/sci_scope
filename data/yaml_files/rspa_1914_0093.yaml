revised_title: Determination of Wave-Lengths and Series Constant in Hydrogen Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors determine the wave-lengths of hydrogen lines and evaluate the series
  constant in the Balmer series spectrum. They use a 10-foot concave grating and a
  hydrogen vacuum tube to obtain accurate measurements, contributing to a better understanding
  of atomic physics and spectroscopy.
