revised_title: The Relation between Specific Refraction and Combining Proportions
  of Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the specific refraction and
  combining proportions of elements, particularly metals, and finds that metals with
  the same valency have similar constants of refraction for equivalent weights. The
  study also reveals that the constants of bivalent, trivalent, quadrivalent, and
  quinquivalent groups are practically the same, ranging around 1.01.
