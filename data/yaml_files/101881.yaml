revised_title: Investigating the Resistance of Air to Moving Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Motion
tldr: The author, John Wallis, examines the relationship between air resistance and
  the speed of moving objects. He proposes a mathematical model to calculate the effective
  force and celerity of a moving object in the presence of air resistance, demonstrating
  that the resistance is proportional to the celerity.
