revised_title: Investigating the Sensitive State of Electrical Discharges through
  Rarefied Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The authors investigate the sensitive state of electrical discharges through
  rarefied gases, discovering that the state is due to a periodic intermittence in
  the discharge with considerable rapidity and regularity. They also find that the
  sensitiveness of the intermittent discharge is solely due to the sensitiveness of
  its individual members.
