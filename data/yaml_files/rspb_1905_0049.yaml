revised_title: 'Inheritance of Heterostylism in Primula: A Study on Mendelian Inheritance'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Plant Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the inheritance of heterostylism in Primula plants,
  discovering that the characters long-style and short-style have a Mendelian inheritance.
  They also study the inheritance of flower color and other characters, providing
  insights into the genetic basis of these traits.
