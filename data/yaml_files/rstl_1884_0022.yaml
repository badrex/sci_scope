revised_title: 'Conditions of Chemical Change in Gases: Hydrogen, Carbonic Oxide,
  and Oxygen'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The authors investigate the conditions of chemical change in gases, focusing
  on hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and oxygen. They study the combustion and explosion
  of these gases, examining factors such as the influence of water vapor, initial
  pressure, and temperature on the rate of chemical change.
