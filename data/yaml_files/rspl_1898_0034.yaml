scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors, George Murray and V. H. Blackman, conducted a year-long study of
  phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean, focusing on Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres.
  They identified and described new species, compared deep-sea deposits with surface
  samples, and established the identity of various coccoliths and rhabdoliths. They
  also studied diatoms, Cyanophyceae, and Pyrocystis species, confirming the unicellular
  algal nature of Pyrocystis.
