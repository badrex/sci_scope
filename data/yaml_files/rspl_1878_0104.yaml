revised_title: On the Specific Inductive Capacities of Certain Dielectrics and Refractive
  Indices
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a study on the specific inductive capacities of various
  dielectrics and their refractive indices using a new experimental method developed
  by Professor Maxwell. The results provide valuable insights into the properties
  of different materials and their potential applications in electrical engineering
  and physics.
