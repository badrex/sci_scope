revised_title: 'On the Law of Extraordinary Refraction in Iceland Spar: A Preliminary
  Notice'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author examines the law of extraordinary refraction in Iceland spar using
  a method described in a previous report on double refraction. The results disprove
  the theory that makes double refraction depend on a difference of inertia in different
  directions and provide a preliminary notice of the findings for those engaged in
  the study of double refraction.
