revised_title: A Correction to the Theory of Irreducible Covariants in Quantics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author identifies an error in Cayley's theory of irreducible covariants
  in quantics, specifically in the interconnection of syzygies. The corrected theory
  accounts for the finite number of irreducible covariants and provides new formulae
  to better understand the relationship between covariants and syzygies.
