revised_title: The Role of Diffusion in Catalysis by Colloidal Metals and Similar
  Substances
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the role of diffusion in catalytic reactions involving
  colloidal metals and finds that convection plays a significant role in the reaction
  process, contradicting Nernst's hypothesis. The study shows that the influence of
  convection is essential in understanding the reaction kinetics and the effect of
  concentration on the reaction rate.
