tldr: Samuel Holland, the Surveyor General of Lands for the Northern District of North
  America, conducted astronomical observations to determine the longitude of several
  locations. He used a 12-foot refracting telescope and an astronomical quadrant to
  measure the positions of celestial bodies and their satellites. The observations
  were made using a gridiron pendulum timepiece, which was occasionally corrected
  by equal altitudes of the Sun.
