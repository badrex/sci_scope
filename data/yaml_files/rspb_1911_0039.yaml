revised_title: The Discovery of Genetic Coupling and Repulsion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Heredity
tldr: Bateson and Punnett discover that in certain cases, genetic factors can either
  be partially coupled or completely repelled in the gametes of heterozygous organisms.
  This phenomenon, now known as coupling and repulsion, has significant implications
  for understanding genetic inheritance and the distribution of traits in offspring.
