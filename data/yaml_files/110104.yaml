scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astro-Geodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: James South presents observations of 458 double and triple stars, with 160 being
  previously undescribed. He also re-examines 36 stars from a prior study. The observations
  include mean results of each set of measures, with the number of measures and the
  difference between the greatest and least means provided. South also compares his
  findings with those of Sir William Herschel, discovering several instances of double
  stars with relative motion and possibly forming ternary systems.
