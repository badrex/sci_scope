revised_title: Investigating the Origin of the Hydrocarbon Flame Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The authors investigate the origin of the hydrocarbon flame spectrum and conclude
  that it is likely due to the presence of acetylene, a hydrocarbon, in the reaction.
  They also discuss the relationship between the hydrocarbon flame spectrum and the
  cyanogen spectrum, as well as the role of hydrogen and nitrogen in their formation.
