scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author describes an improved method for verifying thermometers at the Kew
  Observatory, using a more substantial and efficient apparatus that includes a water
  vessel, an agitator, an external heating arrangement, and a frame for hanging thermometers.
  This new method reduces the time and chance of error in the verification process.
