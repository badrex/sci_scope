scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author discusses the changes in sun-spot spectra observations from a minimum
  to a maximum period, noting the disappearance of certain chemical element lines
  and the appearance of unknown lines. This supports the hypothesis of the solar atmosphere's
  composition and behavior during different phases of sunspot activity.
