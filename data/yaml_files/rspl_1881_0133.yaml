revised_title: On the Movement of Gas in Vacuum Discharges and the Mechanism of the
  Discharge
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the movement of gas in vacuum discharges and observe
  that the passage of a strong current can either increase or decrease the pressure
  in the tube. They propose that the effect of the discharge is to alter the pressure
  by driving occluded gas out of one terminal and drawing it in at the other, with
  the mechanism being reversed upon reversing the discharge.
