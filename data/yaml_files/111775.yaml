revised_title: On the Theory of Invariants and Variants
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author presents a method for determining the coefficients of invariants
  and introduces the concept of variants, which are functions related to invariants.
  The method is applied to quadratic functions, and the author discusses the potential
  for further research on higher-degree functions and the relationship between invariants,
  variants, and covariants.
