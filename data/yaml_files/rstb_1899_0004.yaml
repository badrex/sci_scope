revised_title: A Study of the Phenomena and Causation of Heat-Contraction in Skeletal
  Muscle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the heat-contraction phenomena in skeletal muscles and
  discover that the second contraction is weaker and can be prevented by increased
  friction. They also find that the temperature at which the second contraction commences
  varies between different muscles and is influenced by the anatomical structure of
  the muscle.
