revised_title: Hydrated Platin-Cyanides and Their Color Changes in Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the color changes in hydrated platin-cyanides when cooled
  in liquid air. They discover that the color changes are due to variations in hydration
  and the arrangement of water molecules in the crystals, which affect how light interacts
  with the substance.
