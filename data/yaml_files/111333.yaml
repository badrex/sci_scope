revised_title: 'On the Measurement of the Chemical Action of Light: A New Method and
  Its Applications'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors develop a new method for measuring the chemical action of light
  using a gas containing equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen, generated through
  electrolysis. They construct an apparatus that allows for accurate comparative determinations
  and the reduction of the chemical action of light to an absolute measure. The authors
  also discover the phenomenon of photochemical induction, where the maximum action
  is not attained immediately upon exposure to light.
