revised_title: A New Method for Estimating Stomatal Aperture in Living Leaves
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors develop a porometer, an instrument that measures the rate of air
  flow through stomata in living leaves, to estimate stomatal aperture and investigate
  its relationship with transpiration and environmental factors such as light and
  darkness.

- Plant Physiology
- Stomatal Conductance
- Transpiration
