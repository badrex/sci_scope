revised_title: 'On the Variation of the Specific Heat of Water: A Review of Experimental
  Work and New Method'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author reviews previous experimental work on the variation of water's specific
  heat and presents a new method for measuring it. The study focuses on the challenges
  of thermometry and the need for more accurate measurements to understand the specific
  heat's variation between 0°C and 100°C.
topics:
- Specific Heat of Water
