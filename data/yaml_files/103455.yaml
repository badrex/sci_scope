tldr: A letter from R. Beard describes a tragic incident in which a young lady was
  killed by lightning while sitting in a window during a thunderstorm. The lightning
  struck through the window pane, leaving a hole, and caused a deep contusion on the
  lady's left loin. The phenomenon was a ball of fire that burst with a loud report
  and then rolled off to the southwest. The author discusses the possible causes of
  the fatality and the effects of the lightning on the surrounding area.
