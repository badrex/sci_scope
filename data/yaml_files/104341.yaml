tldr: James Short observes a small star near Venus and, using a reflecting telescope,
  discovers that it appears under the same phase as Venus. He estimates the star's
  distance from Venus and describes its size and brightness. Short also notes two
  dark spots on Venus' surface and mentions a similar observation by Cassini.
