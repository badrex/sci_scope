tldr: The author examines a fossil found in Staffordshire and determines it to be
  a crustaceous animal, specifically a type of Pediculus marinus. This conclusion
  is based on the specimen's physical characteristics and is supported by the work
  of Edward Lhuyd, who described a similar fossil in his Lithophylacium Britannicum
  Ichnographia.
