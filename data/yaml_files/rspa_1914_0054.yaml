scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates a simple case of Fourier's theorem, focusing on the
  behavior of discontinuous functions and their approximations. They explore the effects
  of varying parameters and present a simplified solution for partial suppression
  of shorter wavelengths.
