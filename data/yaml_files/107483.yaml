revised_title: Investigating the Parallax of Fixed Stars in Right Ascension
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Celestial Mechanics
tldr: The author examines the parallax of fixed stars in right ascension using the
  transit instrument and concludes that the limits of parallax are too small to be
  detected through measures in declination. The study suggests that further observations
  may be necessary to determine the existence of parallax or define its limits more
  accurately.
