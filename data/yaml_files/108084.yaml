revised_title: 'Researches in the Integral Calculus: Part II - Applications to Arcs
  of Circles and Conic Sections'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Calculus & Analysis
tldr: The author applies a general method of finding the sums of integrals to discover
  properties of transcendents, focusing on the arcs of circles and conic sections.
  Theorems are derived and demonstrated, providing insights into the relationships
  between circular arcs and tangents.
topics:
- Integral Calculus
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Conic Sections
- Circular Arcs
