tldr: This paper investigates the insulating properties of gutta percha in submarine
  cables and examines the resistance of gutta percha at various temperatures. The
  author also studies the extra resistance that occurs when gutta percha is continuously
  electrified and suggests further investigation into this phenomenon.
