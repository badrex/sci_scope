revised_title: Investigating the Changes in Ova of Mammals After Impregnation and
  the Origin of the Chorion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author examines the changes in mammalian ova after impregnation and discovers
  that the gelatinous envelope surrounding the ovum in the ovary eventually forms
  the chorion. This finding challenges previous beliefs about the role of the vitellary
  membrane in chorion formation and provides new insights into mammalian reproduction
  and embryonic development.
