revised_title: On the Specific Inductive Capacity of Gases and the Effect of the Guard-Ring
  Condenser
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrical Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the specific inductive capacity of gases using a guard-ring
  condenser and discusses the effect of the condenser's design on the accuracy of
  the measurements. The author compares their results with those of other researchers
  and highlights the importance of accounting for the connecting wire's influence
  on the measurements.
