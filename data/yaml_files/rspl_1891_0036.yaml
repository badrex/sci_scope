revised_title: 'Repulsion and Rotation in Alternating Electric Currents: Theoretical
  Analysis and Experiments'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the repulsion and rotation produced by alternating electric
  currents, presenting a theoretical analysis and experimental results. The study
  focuses on the effects of self-induction on the mechanical force between conductors
  and the resulting repulsion and attraction. The author also discusses the spinning
  of a copper sphere near an alternating magnetic pole and provides a detailed explanation
  for this phenomenon.
