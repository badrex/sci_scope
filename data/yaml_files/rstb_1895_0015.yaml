  in Ornament'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Biology
tldr: The author investigates the pigments of the Pierid butterflies and discovers
  that their normal excretory products serve as ornaments. The study focuses on the
  role of uric acid derivatives in the coloration of these butterflies, providing
  insights into the pigments' chemical composition and their function in the insects'
  excretory system.
