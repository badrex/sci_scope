revised_title: 'The Effect of Light on Bacteria and Other Organisms: A Study on Sterilization
  and Growth'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of light exposure on the growth and development
  of bacteria and other organisms in various solutions. They find that sunlight can
  effectively sterilize certain solutions and inhibit bacterial growth, while also
  discovering that the presence of light can slow down the rate of bacterial increase.
