revised_title: The Identification and Analysis of the Reducing Agent in Normal Human
  Urine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the reducing agent in normal human urine and discovers
  that it is not glucose, but a substance disintegrated by prolonged boiling with
  dilute potassium hydrate solution. This substance is not kreatinin, as previously
  suggested, and it accounts for one-fourth of the total reduction of cupric oxide
  in normal urine.
