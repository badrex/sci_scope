  with Alkalis and Acids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: The author examines the color-changing properties of various plant pigments,
  such as turnsol, violet, sugar-loaf paper, mulberry, and poppy petals, and their
  reactions with acids and alkalis. The study provides insights into the chemical
  composition and behavior of these natural dyes, which can be useful for the art
  of dyeing and the understanding of plant chemistry.
