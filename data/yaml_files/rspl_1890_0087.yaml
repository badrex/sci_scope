revised_title: A New Method for Focometry of Lenses and Lens-Combinations
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Optical Engineering & Design
tldr: The author presents a new method for focometry that eliminates double adjustments
  and measurements of optical images, allowing for a more accurate determination of
  both the true focal length and the distance between the principal points of a lens
  or lens-combination.
