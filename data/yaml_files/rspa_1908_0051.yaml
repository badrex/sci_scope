revised_title: The Crystal Structure and Chemical Constitution of Picryl Derivatives
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The authors study the relationship between the crystalline form and chemical
  constitution of picryl derivatives, using a new method to determine the crystal
  structures and equivalence parameters of various compounds. They find that the vertical
  dimension of the crystal structure is preserved in the picryl derivatives, while
  the other dimensions change based on the specific compound's chemical properties.
