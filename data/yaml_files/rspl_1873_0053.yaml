scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences

tldr: The author investigates the winter climate and thermometric observations in
  the Alps, specifically in Davos, Switzerland. They find that the sky is usually
  cloudless, and the solar rays have little effect on the temperature due to the snow.
  The author also compares the temperature readings with those from Greenwich, England,
  and discusses the differences in their instruments and methods.
