revised_title: Determination of Temperature Correction for the Invariable Pendulum
  in the South of England's Climate
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics &amp; Metrology
tldr: Edward Sabine investigates the temperature correction for the invariable pendulum
  in the South of England's climate, finding a correction of 0.44 vibrations per day
  for each degree Fahrenheit. He also discusses the importance of obtaining rates
  of pendulums in a wider range of artificial temperatures for more accurate results.
