revised_title: 'Selective Absorption in Ketones: A New Theory'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Chemical Bonding
tldr: The authors investigate the selective absorption of ketones and propose a new
  theory that intramolecular vibrations, caused by the formation and breaking down
  of unstable ring systems, are responsible for this phenomenon. They suggest that
  free partial valencies, which appear on atoms linked by a double bond, play a role
  in these vibrations.
