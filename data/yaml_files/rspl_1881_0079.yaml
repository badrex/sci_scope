scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Manufacturing & Machining
tldr: The author examines the action of cutting tools on various materials, such as
  wrought iron, steel, and brass, and classifies the different actions observed during
  the cutting process. The study focuses on the work expended in each action and the
  factors that influence the cutting process, including the tool's geometry, material
  properties, and friction.
