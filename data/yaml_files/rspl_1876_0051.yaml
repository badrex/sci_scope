  Observations on the Repulsion Resulting from Radiation'

scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the force of repulsion exerted
  by radiation and the viscosity of residual gas at different stages of exhaustion.
  The results show that the force of repulsion and viscosity decrease as the gas is
  exhausted, with oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid exhibiting distinct differences
  in their properties.
