revised_title: Refractive Indices of Sulphuric Acid at Different Concentrations
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive indices of sulphuric acid at various
  concentrations and densities, comparing their findings with previous studies. They
  determine the maximum refractive index occurs between 60% and 70% concentration
  and discuss the implications of their results on the understanding of sulphuric
  acid solutions.
