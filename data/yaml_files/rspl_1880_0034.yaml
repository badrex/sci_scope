revised_title: Investigating the Thermal Conductivity of Water with a Screen
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to test the effects of conduction of heat
  downwards in liquids by using a screen inside the cylindrical vessel. The results
  indicate that the apparent conducting power of water comes out a little greater
  with the screen than without, suggesting that conduction down the walls of the bath
  is not a significant factor in heat transfer.
