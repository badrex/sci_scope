  and Thermal Conduction'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
tldr: This paper investigates the kinetic theory of a composite monatomic gas, focusing
  on diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conduction. The authors develop a method to
  determine the velocity-distribution function and formulate equations for diffusion
  and energy transfer in a composite gas. They also introduce a new physical constant,
  the specific energy of diffusion, and discuss its implications.
topics:
- Kinetic Theory of Gases
- Diffusion
- Viscosity
- Thermal Conduction
- Velocity-Distribution Function
