revised_title: The Role of Alkaline Silicates in the Metamorphism of Rocks
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Mineralogy
tldr: The author investigates the role of silicates of alkalies in the metamorphism
  of rocks, specifically through the reaction between silica and carbonates. They
  demonstrate that the presence of small amounts of alkali can lead to a continuous
  process of change in sedimentary rocks, transforming them through the formation
  of silicates and carbonates.
