revised_title: De Saint-Venant's Solution for Flexure of Cantilevers with Cross-Section
  in the Form of Complete and Curtate Circular Sectors
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Structural Engineering
tldr: The authors extend De Saint-Venant's solution for the flexure of cantilevers
  to cases with cross-sections having only one axis of symmetry. They apply this solution
  to a cantilever with a cross-section of a curtate circular sector and analyze the
  influence of fixing conditions on deflection.
