revised_title: Investigating the Acceleration of the Moon's Motion
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Lunar Dynamics
tldr: The author examines historical eclipse observations to investigate the acceleration
  of the Moon's motion and compares them with the Newtonian theory. The findings suggest
  that the Moon's mean motion may have been swifter in some centuries than the current
  astronomical tables represent.
