revised_title: On the Photometric Analysis of Glow Lamp Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Abney and Festing investigate the photometric properties of glow lamps, specifically
  the intensity of visible light emitted by incandescent filaments. They develop a
  method to measure and compare the light emitted by different filaments, providing
  insights into the relationship between current, potential, and light intensity.
