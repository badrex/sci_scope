revised_title: On the Spontaneous Segmentation of Liquid Annuli
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Colloids
tldr: The author investigates the spontaneous segmentation of liquid annuli, finding
  that the law of segmentation for an annulus lying on a plate is the same as for
  a straight cylinder under similar conditions. The study uses mercury annuli on both
  horizontal surfaces of glass and iron, providing evidence for the law of splitting.
