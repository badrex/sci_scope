scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The author examines the existence and location of outlying nerve-cells in the
  mammalian spinal cord, specifically in the anterior, lateral, and posterior white
  columns. They discuss the possible connections between these isolated cells and
  the surrounding nerve fibers, as well as the implications for understanding neural
  pathways and communication within the spinal cord.
