revised_title: Magnetization's Effect on Electrical Resistance in Iron and Steel
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the impact of magnetization on the electrical resistance
  of iron and steel, discovering that the resistance decreases with increasing magnetization.
  The study also reveals that the resistance changes are proportional to the square
  of the current strength.
