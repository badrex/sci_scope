revised_title: The Velocity of Ions Produced in Gases by Röntgen Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of ions produced in gases by Röntgen rays
  using a modified method that compares the ionic velocity with the gas stream velocity.
  They find that the negative ion moves faster in most cases, and their results contribute
  to the understanding of physical quantities related to ion mobility and gas conductivity.
topics:
- Ion Velocity
- Röntgen Rays
- Electric Fields
- Gas Conductivity
- Ion Mobility
