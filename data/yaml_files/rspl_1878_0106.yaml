revised_title: Spectrum Analysis of Electric Discharge in Vacuum Tubes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author examines the spectrum of the electric discharge in vacuum tubes and
  discovers differences between the positive and negative terminal spectra. The negative
  spectrum consists of four bright lines, while the positive spectrum has a wide black
  band. The findings suggest that the light of the electric discharge is an incandescence
  of the medium and terminals, and may be influenced by electric polarity.
