revised_title: Determination of the Specific Resistance of Mercury
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the specific resistance of mercury using various experimental
  methods and compare their results with previous studies. They discuss the factors
  affecting the resistance measurements and provide corrections for the length and
  cross-section of the mercury column. The study aims to improve the accuracy of the
  B.A. unit and contribute to the understanding of the physical properties of mercury.
