revised_title: On the Mechanical Conditions of Meteorite Swarms and Their Relevance
  to Cosmogony
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science & Meteoritics
tldr: The author suggests that the fluid pressure essential to the nebular hypothesis
  can be explained as the result of countless impacts of meteorites. By considering
  the mechanics of a swarm of meteorites, the author aims to reconcile the meteoric
  theory with the nebular hypothesis, providing a possible explanation for the origin
  of stellar and planetary systems.
