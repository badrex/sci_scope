revised_title: Stability of Pear-Shaped Equilibrium Figures in Rotating Liquid Masses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author investigates the stability of pear-shaped figures of equilibrium
  in rotating liquid masses, determining the conditions under which the pear-shaped
  figure is stable or unstable. The study uses mathematical models and approximations
  to analyze the behavior of the liquid mass and its equilibrium figures.
