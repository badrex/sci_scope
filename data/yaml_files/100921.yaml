scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: In this letter, Newton discusses the design and performance of his new telescope,
  suggesting improvements to the aperture and charge proportions for various lengths
  of the instrument. He also compares the performance of a metal telescope to a glass
  one and shares his thoughts on correcting the figure of the metal to improve its
  performance.
