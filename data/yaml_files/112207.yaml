revised_title: Experiments on the Calorific and Tissue-Forming Properties of Food
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Nutrition & Metabolism
tldr: The author conducts experiments on rats and a hawk to investigate the calorific
  and tissue-forming properties of different types of food. The results suggest that
  nitrogenous materials can be directly calorific without forming tissue, and non-nitrogenous
  substances can be directly calorific without entering into the composition of tissue.
  The study also shows that life can be maintained on a diet almost exclusively nitrogenous,
  with proper inorganic substances.
