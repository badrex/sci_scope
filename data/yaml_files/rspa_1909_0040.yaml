revised_title: Ionisation in Various Gases by Secondary y-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: 'The author investigates the ionization of various gases by secondary y-rays
  emitted by substances exposed to primary y-rays from radium. The ionization is found
  to be proportional to the pressure, with the ionization in a chamber consisting
  of three parts: ions ejected from gas molecules, ions from secondary cathode rays,
  and ions from high-velocity cathode rays.'
