  a Common Balance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Classical Physics
tldr: This paper describes an experiment to determine the mean density of the Earth
  and the gravitation constant using a common balance. The experiment involves measuring
  the attraction between two known masses and using this to calculate the mean density
  of the Earth. The results obtained are the gravitation constant and the mean density
  of the Earth.
