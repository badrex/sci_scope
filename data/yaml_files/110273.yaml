revised_title: Investigation of Endosmose and Exosmose Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Membrane Transport
tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of endosmose and exosmose, demonstrating
  that water moves through a membrane due to its strong attraction for water, while
  the membrane has no attraction for alcohol. This process is similar to the rise
  of sap in plant capillary vessels.
