revised_title: The Electrical Conductivity and Luminosity of Flames Containing Vaporised
  Salts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity and luminosity of flames
  containing vaporized salts, specifically focusing on alkali metals. They explore
  the relationship between conductivity and electromotive force, concentration of
  salt, and the behavior of different salts in various flames. Their findings suggest
  that the coloration of flames and their electrical conductivity when containing
  vaporized salts may be due to a common cause, involving the presence of free ions.
