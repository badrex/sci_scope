  Photoheliograph

scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: This paper discusses the sun-pictures taken by the Kew photoheliograph for the
  years 1862 and 1863, providing the heliographic latitude and longitude of every
  spot and the area of each group on each day it was observed. The authors also describe
  the method used to deduce the heliographic position of spots from the measurements
  made. The results of subsequent years and their final discussion in relation to
  the sun's elements will be published later.
