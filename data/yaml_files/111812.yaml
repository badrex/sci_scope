scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author continues his research on quantics, focusing on the theorem that
  establishes the relationship between covariants and asyzygetic integrals. He demonstrates
  that the number of irreducible covariants and invariants becomes infinite for quantics
  of high enough order, and provides specific examples for quintics and sextics.
