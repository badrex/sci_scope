revised_title: A New Method for Determining Freezing Points
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors present a new method for determining freezing points, focusing on
  the proper arrangement of heterogeneous systems and the treatment of temperature
  measurements. They discuss the importance of minimizing the convergence temperature
  and maintaining equilibrium in the system to achieve accurate results.
