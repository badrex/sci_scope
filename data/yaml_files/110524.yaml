scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics
tldr: M. Kropalschek presents a paper challenging the theory of universal gravitation
  and its role in regulating planetary motions. He disputes the accuracy of Kepler's
  laws and the fundamental doctrines of astronomy, proposing a new hypothesis based
  on a supposed variation of the progressive motion of planets in a perfectly circular
  orbit.
