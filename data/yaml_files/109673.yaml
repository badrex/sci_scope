revised_title: Optimizing the Design of Voltaic Apparatus for Chemical Research
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemical Engineering
tldr: The author investigates various methods of constructing a voltaic apparatus
  for chemical research, focusing on the balance between intensity and quantity of
  electricity. He tests different battery designs and electrolytes, finding that a
  large number of small plates with a certain distance between them is necessary for
  overcoming resistance in imperfect conductors, while large plates are needed for
  igniting perfect conductors.
