revised_title: Lunar Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Elements at Kew Observatory
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Geophysics
tldr: This paper presents the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination and
  the horizontal and vertical components of magnetic force, derived from a seven-year
  series of photographic records at the Kew Observatory between 1858 and 1864. The
  author demonstrates a consistent and systematic lunar-diurnal influence on these
  magnetic elements and suggests that this variation is likely due to the direct magnetic
  action of the moon, which could lead to a significant advancement in our understanding
  of Earth and moon magnetism.
