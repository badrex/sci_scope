revised_title: The Solubility of Iron in Simple Water by the Intervention of Fixed
  Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the solubility of iron in simple water using fixed air
  and discovers that iron can be dissolved in water by the intervention of fixed air,
  suggesting that many chalybeate springs may sustain their metallic charge through
  this process.
