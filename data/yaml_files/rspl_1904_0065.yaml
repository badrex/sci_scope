revised_title: Investigating the Behavior of Statoliths in Plants Under Centrifugal
  Force
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of centrifugal force on geotropism in plants,
  specifically examining the behavior of statoliths in Setaria and Sorghum seedlings.
  Their experiments reveal that a centrifugal force of 0.02-0.04 g can induce geotropic
  curvature, and the movement of starch grains within the statocytes is influenced
  by the force.
