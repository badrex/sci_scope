revised_title: A Method for Determining Velocities of Saponification
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: The author presents a method for determining the velocities of saponification
  using electrical conductivity measurements. The method involves monitoring the change
  in conductivity of a solution containing an ester and a caustic alkali during the
  saponification process. The author demonstrates the method using the saponification
  of methyl acetate by caustic soda and provides a velocity constant for the reaction.
