scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Sciences
tldr: This paper presents a discussion of 19,000 tide observations at Bristol, aiming
  to determine the empirical laws of diurnal inequalities in tide times and heights.
  The author uses a self-registering tide-gauge and transit observations to analyze
  the data, finding that diurnal inequalities are not as minute as previously thought.
topics:
- Tide Observations
- Diurnal Inequalities
- Tidal Dynamics
- Tidal Heights
- Tidal Times
