  Elasticity and the Velocity of Sound in Metals'

scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: This study investigates the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, focusing on the elasticity and velocity of sound in metals. The research
  compares the moduli of torsional and longitudinal elasticities using both statical
  and kinetical methods, finding that the values are consistent when deformations
  are small. The study also reveals that the velocity of sound in metal wires is independent
  of the load on the wire and is not significantly affected by permanent extension.
