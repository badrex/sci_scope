revised_title: Investigating the Origin of Certain Spectrum Lines Using Interference
  Methods
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors apply interference methods to study the origin of certain spectrum
  lines, focusing on calcium, strontium, and barium lines. They find that the calcium
  lines are produced by particles with different masses, suggesting that the lines
  are due to calcium molecules and atoms. The study provides insights into the temperature
  and nature of luminous particles in the production of these lines.
