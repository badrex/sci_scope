scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Infrastructure
tldr: The author, Tankred Robinson, provides a detailed description of the design
  and construction of the Roman Bridge at St. Esprit in France. He discusses the unique
  features of the bridge, such as the unequal angles and the use of jetting to break
  the force of the Rhone River. He also suggests that the design could be useful for
  building bridges in Yorkshire, where streams are often torrents with rocky bottoms.
