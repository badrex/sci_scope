tldr: Wollaston describes a method of freezing at a distance using an instrument called
  Cryophorus, which consists of a tube with two balls, one containing water to be
  frozen. By placing the empty ball in a freezing mixture, the water in the opposite
  ball freezes in a few minutes due to the transfer of heat at a distance.
