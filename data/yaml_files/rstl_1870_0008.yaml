tldr: The author investigates the variations in the human skull, particularly the
  antero-posterior direction, using a systematic method of craniometry. The study
  aims to understand the real nature of differences between the crania of different
  nations or individuals by considering the arch and base of the skull in their connection
  and measuring the relations of parts by distances and angles.
