tldr: Faraday investigates the recombination of elements separated by voltaic action
  and introduces new terms for electrochemical decomposition. He also develops the
  volta-electrometer, a device for measuring electric currents, based on the law that
  the decomposing action of any current of electricity is constant for a constant
  quantity of electricity.
