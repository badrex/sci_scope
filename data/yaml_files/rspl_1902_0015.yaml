revised_title: On the Properties and Contraction of Arterial and Venous Walls
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Vascular Biology
tldr: This study investigates the properties and contraction of arterial and venous
  walls after death, examining factors such as mechanical stimulation, cooling, and
  exposure to air. The research highlights the importance of understanding post-mortem
  contraction when measuring arteries and the persistence of excitability in arteries
  after death.
