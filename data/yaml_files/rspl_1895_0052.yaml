revised_title: 'Calibration of the Capillary Electrometer: A New Method for Determining
  Electromotive Changes'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Measurement Techniques
tldr: The author presents a new method for calibrating the capillary electrometer,
  allowing for the precise measurement of electromotive changes in short time intervals.
  The method involves using normal excursions and polar curves to determine the acting
  potential difference and sub-normal values, making it applicable to various types
  of dead-beat elements.
