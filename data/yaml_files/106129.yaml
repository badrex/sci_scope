scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Aquaculture & Fisheries
tldr: The author, Humphrey Jackson, shares his findings on the genuine manufacture
  of isinglass, a gelatinous substance derived from fish, in Russia and England. He
  reveals that isinglass is made from the membranous parts of fish, particularly the
  sounds or air bladders of freshwater fish, which are then dried and twisted into
  various forms. Jackson also discusses the potential for British fisheries to supply
  Europe with this valuable product.
