revised_title: On the Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations and Tidal Prediction
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Coastal Studies
tldr: The author presents a method for creating a general tide table applicable to
  all times, allowing users to compute tidal heights for specific days with minimal
  effort. The method involves analyzing tidal observations using the harmonic system
  and considering the time of moon's transit, time of year, and other variables to
  create accurate predictions.
topics:
- Tidal prediction
- Harmonic analysis
- Tidal constants
- Tide-gauge
- Tidal observation
