revised_title: Catalytic Actions in Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation of Acetaldehyde
  and Ethyl Alcohol
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Catalysis
tldr: The authors investigate the catalytic actions of solid surfaces in the hydrogenation
  of acetaldehyde and dehydrogenation of ethyl alcohol using finely-divided metals.
  They find that the presence of water improves the yield of acetaldehyde and that
  the hydrogenation process is slower in the presence of water.
