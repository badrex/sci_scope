revised_title: 'Adsorption and Occlusion: The Law of Distribution in the Case of a
  Phase with Mechanical Rigidity'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author investigates the law of distribution in cases where one phase possesses
  mechanical rigidity, focusing on adsorption and occlusion. The study examines the
  absorption of gases by palladium, platinum, and carbon, providing insights into
  the pressure-concentration relationships and the behavior of gases in these materials.
topics:
- Adsorption
- Occlusion
- Gas Absorption
- Phases with Mechanical Rigidity
