revised_title: The Permanency of the Variation of the Compass in Jamaica
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author investigates the permanency of the variation of the compass in Jamaica
  and discovers that the courses of the lines and meridians delineated on original
  diagrams from 1660 to present time coincide with the lines and meridians delineated
  on new diagrams from recent surveys made by the magnetic needle. This suggests that
  no alteration of the variation could have taken place during that period of time
  in Jamaica.
