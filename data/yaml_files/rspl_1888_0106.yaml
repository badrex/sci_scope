revised_title: On the Atomic Ratio of Oxygen and Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the atomic ratio of oxygen and hydrogen through combustion
  experiments using an eudiometer. The results indicate an atomic weight of oxygen
  of 15.89, with a focus on the importance of accurate weight estimation of hydrogen
  in the process.
