scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: Charles Blacklewar's paper demonstrates three theorems related to properties
  of numbers in geometrical progression. The theorems cover divisibility of terms
  when raised to certain powers and the relationship between the sum of terms raised
  to different powers.
