revised_title: On the Influence of a Magnetic Medium on Diamagnetism
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author examines the effects of compression on a diamagnetic cube and discusses
  the role of a magnetic medium in its magnetic properties. The study concludes that
  the method of argument adopted by Professor Tyndall is not universally applicable,
  and alternative properties of the internal medium can be considered to avoid contradictory
  conclusions.
