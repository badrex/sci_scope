revised_title: The Power of Steapsin in Hydrolyzing Fats
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the ability of steapsin to hydrolyze fats outside the
  organism and find that it can break down fats to a significant extent. They also
  observe that steapsin remains active even when bile is added to the mixture, which
  has implications for understanding the digestive process.
