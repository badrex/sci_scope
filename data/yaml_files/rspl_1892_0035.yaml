scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: The author investigates the excretion process in sponges, specifically focusing
  on Metschnikoff cells and their role in excretion. The study reveals that these
  cells reach the exterior surface and form pores, while the granules in the cells
  are excretory in nature.
