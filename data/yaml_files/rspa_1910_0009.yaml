revised_title: The Study of Thallium-Zinc Sulphate and Selenate Crystal Structures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Crystallography
tldr: The author investigates the crystal structures and properties of thallium-zinc
  sulphate and selenate, providing detailed measurements and analysis of their morphological
  angles, density, and refractive indices. The study contributes to understanding
  the position of thallium salts in the rhombic series and the monoclinic double salts
  containing thallium.
