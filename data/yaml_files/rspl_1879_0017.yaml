revised_title: Investigating the Magnetic Lines of Force in Magnets and the Obliquity
  of Bar Magnet Equators
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author presents a new method for investigating magnetic lines of force in
  magnets, demonstrating the obliquity of the equator and axis of bar magnets. The
  method involves suspending magnetized steel needles on silk fibers and tracing the
  curves formed by the magnetic forces. The results reveal the oblique convergency
  of magnetic lines towards the north and south poles and the existence of a neutral
  zone.
