revised_title: Investigating the Variable Emission of the Sun's Light and Heat
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Astrophysics
tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the variable emission of the Sun's
  light and heat, experimenting with different liquids to view the Sun without darkening
  glasses. He infers that the observed symptoms support the idea of a connection between
  the Sun's emission and the temperature of our atmosphere, and suggests that astronomy
  may provide a means for predicting seasonal temperatures based on solar observations.
