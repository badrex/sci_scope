revised_title: Electromotive Phenomena of the Mammalian Heart
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the electromotive phenomena of the mammalian heart using
  electrometers and various experimental methods. They find that the wave of negativity
  in the ventricle is diphasic, with negativity at the base preceding that at the
  apex. The study also reveals the sensitivity of the direction of the electrical
  variation to changes in temperature and provides insights into the propagation of
  the wave in the mammalian ventricle.
