scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effect of different types of light on the activity
  of wood in producing images on photographic plates. The study reveals that blue
  light significantly increases the activity of wood, while red light has no effect.
  This research could have implications for understanding the behavior of resins and
  other substances in wood.
