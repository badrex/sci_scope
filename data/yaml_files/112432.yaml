revised_title: Investigating Instrumental Errors in Magnetic Dip Observations
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the uneliminated instrumental errors in magnetic dip
  observations, specifically focusing on the effects of an elliptical axle and the
  displacement of the center of gravity in the needle. By analyzing the differences
  in the mean values of the observed dips, the author aims to determine the constants
  related to these errors and improve the accuracy of magnetic dip measurements.
