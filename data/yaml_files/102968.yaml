tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the quality of air produced from
  gunpowder fired in Vacuo Boyliano. He observed that the explosions were more significant
  when resisted by air than in a vacuum. The factitious air produced by gunpowder
  was found to be affected by heat and cold, similar to common air. The experiment
  also estimated the weight of heat generated by the gunpowder to be about 1/3 of
  an atmosphere of air.
