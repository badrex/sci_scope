  and Tolylic'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author describes the synthesis and properties of various mustard oils, including
  ethylic, methyl, amylic, and tolylic, and their corresponding isomers. The synthesis
  process involves treating monamines with bisulphide of carbon, followed by the action
  of heat and conversion into sulphuretted ureas and mustard oils. The author also
  discusses the physical and chemical properties of these compounds, as well as their
  reactions with other substances.
