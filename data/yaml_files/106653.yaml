revised_title: Investigating the Principle of Acidity, Composition of Water, and Phlogiston
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author conducts experiments to explore the composition of water and the
  principle of acidity, discovering that nitrous acid is produced when dephlogisticated
  and inflammable air are decomposed. This finding challenges the phlogiston theory
  and contributes to the understanding of chemical reactions and air composition.
