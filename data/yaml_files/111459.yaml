scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Differential Equations & Analysis
tldr: The author explores singular solutions of differential equations, focusing on
  Clairaut's theorem, Laplace's theory, and the symmetrical form of these equations.
  He also discusses the generalization of transformed types and their application
  to various partial differential equations.
topics:
- Differential Equations
- Clairaut's Theorem
- Partial Differential Equations
- Laplace's Theory
- Symmetrical Form
