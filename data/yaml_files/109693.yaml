revised_title: Animal Secretions and the Role of Electricity
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Animal Physiology & Anatomy
tldr: The author explores the possibility of electricity being the means for secretion
  in animals, using electric fish as an example. He conducts experiments with blood
  and serum, applying electric power to separate its constituent parts, suggesting
  that weaker powers within animals could cause different secretions and modify albumen
  into various animal solids.
