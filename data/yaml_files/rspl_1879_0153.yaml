revised_title: The Hardening Effect and Viscous Elongation in Soft Iron Wires Under
  Stress
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: 'The author investigates the effects of stress on soft iron wires and discovers
  two distinct phenomena: the hardening effect, where the wire''s elasticity increases
  after a period of constant stress, and the viscous effect, where the wire elongates
  gradually over time under constant stress. These findings have implications for
  understanding the behavior of materials under stress.'
