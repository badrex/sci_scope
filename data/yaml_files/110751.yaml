revised_title: Innovations in Calotype Photography
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The author, H. F. Talbot, describes his recent improvements in photography,
  specifically the Calotype method. He details the process of creating Calotype paper
  and its extreme sensitivity to light, allowing for images to be captured in moonlight
  or through a camera obscura. The resulting images are initially invisible impressions
  that can be developed and fixed using specific chemical solutions, creating both
  negative and positive images.
