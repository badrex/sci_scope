scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineralogy & Petrology
tldr: The author discovers two new minerals, Langite and Waringtonite, in Cornwall
  and describes their physical and chemical properties, as well as their crystal structures.
  Langite and Waringtonite are found in association with other minerals, and their
  specific gravities, hardnesses, and chemical compositions are compared to differentiate
  them from other minerals like Brochantite.
topics:
- Mineralogy
- Crystallography
- Geochemistry
- Brochantite Group Minerals
- Cornish Minerals
