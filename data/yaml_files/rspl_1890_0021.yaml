revised_title: The Role of Larynx in Quiet Respiration and Phonation
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Thoracic & Respiratory Medicine
tldr: The author investigates the position and function of the vocal cords in quiet
  respiration and concludes that the larynx plays an active role in maintaining a
  wider glottis during quiet respiration. The study also reveals that the abductor
  muscles of the vocal cords are in a state of semi-tonic contraction, likely due
  to reflex impulses from the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata.
