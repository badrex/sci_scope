revised_title: Investigation of Magnetisation Propagation in Iron and its Relation
  to Electric Currents
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors study the propagation of magnetisation in iron and its relationship
  with electric currents. They find that the induction does not instantly reverse
  when the magnetising current is reversed, and that the delay in reversal is due
  to electric currents induced in the iron. The authors also draw inferences about
  the behavior of other diameters and discuss the effects of local currents in transformers
  and dynamo machines.
