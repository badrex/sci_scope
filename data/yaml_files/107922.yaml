revised_title: Investigating the Transient Magnetic State of Non-Metallic Substances
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The author investigates the transient magnetic state of various non-metallic
  substances and develops experimental techniques to study their magnetic susceptibility
  in an exhausted receiver, screened from vortices, and liberated from the influence
  of a resisting medium.
topics:
- Magnetism
- Transient Magnetic State
- 'No'
- Exhaustion and Vortices
