revised_title: 'Investigating Parallax in Double Stars: Challenges and Observations'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Astrometry
tldr: The author, Lord Wrottesley, discusses the challenges and limitations faced
  during his six-year-long observation of parallax in double stars using an equatorial
  telescope. He describes the instrument, observational methods, and the meager results
  obtained, ultimately concluding that further perseverance with his current means
  would be impolitic.
