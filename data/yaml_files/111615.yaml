revised_title: Investigating Cutaneous Absorption and Atropine's Effects on Pupillary
  Dilation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Toxicology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on cutaneous absorption using various solutions
  and animal subjects, focusing on atropine's effects on pupillary dilation. The study
  reveals that factors such as age, solution strength, and solvent type influence
  absorption rates and the degree of dilation.
