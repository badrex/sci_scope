  Tentacles
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: This study investigates the histological changes and mechanisms in the tentacles
  of Drosera dichotoma, a carnivorous plant, during stimulation and secretion. The
  author examines the role of gland-cells, the structure of the tentacles, and the
  cellular responses to various stimuli, such as heat, moisture, and food, providing
  insights into the plant's feeding and trapping mechanisms.
