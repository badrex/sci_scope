  Instruments
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, Mr. Ramsden, presents a new construction of eye-glasses for telescopes
  used with mathematical instruments. This design aims to correct errors caused by
  the spherical figure of the lenses and the different refrangibility of light, improving
  the accuracy and functionality of these instruments.
