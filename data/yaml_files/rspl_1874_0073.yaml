revised_title: Effects of Stress on Inductive Magnetism in Soft Iron
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: This paper investigates the effects of stress on inductive magnetism in soft
  iron, discovering that the critical value of the magnetizing force determines whether
  stress will increase or decrease induced magnetization.
topics:
- Magnetism
- Soft Iron
- Magnetic Properties
