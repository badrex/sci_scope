revised_title: On a New Series of Periodical Colours Produced by Grooved Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the color effects produced by grooved surfaces on metallic
  and transparent materials, discovering a series of periodical colors that vary with
  the angle of incidence. The phenomenon is demonstrated through various experiments
  and observed in different specimens, revealing the relationship between the number
  of grooves and the intensity of the colors produced.
