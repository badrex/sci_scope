revised_title: Electric Discharge between Electrodes at Different Temperatures in
  Air and High Vacua
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the electric discharge between electrodes at different
  temperatures in air and high vacua, revealing curious effects in the behavior of
  an electric arc between carbon poles and a third insulated carbon or metal plate.
  The experiments demonstrate the influence of the position and material of the plate,
  as well as the impact of shielding the negative leg of the carbon.
