scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The author presents a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium,
  focusing on the relationship between aether and matter. The theory introduces the
  mobile electron as the true physical element and provides a more precise understanding
  of electric currents, ponderomotive forces, and electric radiation.
