tldr: Sir William Crookes examines the ultra-violet spectrum of gadolinium and identifies
  impurities such as yttrium, europium, samarium, ytterbium, scandium, bismuth, magnesium,
  and calcium. He also discusses the phosphorescent spectrum of Urbain's gadolinium,
  which reveals the presence of an impurity called victorium.
