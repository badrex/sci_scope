scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The author investigates the phosphorescence and chemical reactions caused by
  radium rays in various substances, including barium platino-cyanide, calcspar, potassium
  iodide, potassium chloride, and potassium bromide. The study reveals that certain
  forms of phosphorescence are due to physical changes, while others involve chemical
  actions within the substances.
