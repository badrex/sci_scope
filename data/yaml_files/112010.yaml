revised_title: Comparison of Magnetic Disturbances at Kew and Lisbon
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The authors compare magnetic records from Kew and Lisbon observatories during
  a magnetic disturbance in July 1863. They find that the Lisbon records show a reversal
  and nearly constant ratio between the ordinates of the declination and vertical-force
  curves, while the horizontal force and declination curves have a more variable relationship.
