revised_title: Determination of the Specific Resistance of Mercury
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific resistance of mercury
  and found that their results agree closely with those of Siemens. They also calculated
  the resistance in terms of the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system.
