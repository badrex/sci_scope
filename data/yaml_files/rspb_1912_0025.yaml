revised_title: Investigating the Composition of Blood Gases during Oxygen Inhalation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: The authors investigate the composition of blood gases in cats during oxygen
  inhalation and find that the average blood gases are practically identical when
  comparing experiments with air and oxygen. The study supports the view that the
  haemochromogen moiety of the haemoglobin molecule is identical in all animals.
