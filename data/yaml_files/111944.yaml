revised_title: Investigations on the Decomposition of Oxygenated Substances by Peroxide
  of Hydrogen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author examines the decomposition of various oxygenated substances, such
  as permanganic acid, ferricyanide, hypochlorite, and chromic acid, by peroxide of
  hydrogen. The study reveals that the decomposition is in an invariable atomic proportion
  and provides insights into the behavior of different classes of peroxides.
