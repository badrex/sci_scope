revised_title: Observations on Foetal Nourishment and the Role of Amniotic Fluid
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author presents evidence that the fetus is partially nourished by the amniotic
  fluid, which enters the digestive system and provides essential nutrients. This
  finding challenges the prevailing belief that the fetus is solely nourished by blood
  through the umbilical cord.
