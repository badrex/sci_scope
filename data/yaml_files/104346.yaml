revised_title: Investigating the Conductivity of Non-Electrics and the Role of Moisture
  in Electricity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to demonstrate that the conductivity
  of electricity in non-electric materials is determined by their quality rather than
  the quantity of matter. The role of moisture in electricity is also investigated,
  showing that it can change the conductivity of materials and affect the distance
  over which electricity can travel.
