revised_title: The Origin of Bacteria and Their Relation to the Process of Putrefaction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Ecology
tldr: The author challenges the idea that putrefaction in boiled fluids is due to
  contamination by bacteria from the atmosphere. Instead, they provide evidence that
  bacteria can arise de novo in these fluids, suggesting a new understanding of the
  origin of bacteria and their role in putrefaction.
