revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Fluid Resistance in Boats
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: James Walker presents a new method for measuring the resistance of fluids to
  boats using a spring weighing machine attached to the boat. The experiments show
  that the resistance increases at a higher rate than the square of the velocity,
  and the findings are applied to steam navigation and other modes of transportation.
