revised_title: 'Magnetization of Iron at High Temperatures: A Preliminary Notice'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Condensed Matter Physics
tldr: The author presents a preliminary study on the magnetization of iron at high
  temperatures, using a method similar to previous experiments on nickel. The study
  aims to determine the curves of magnetization at varying temperatures and provides
  resistance observations alongside temperature estimates.
