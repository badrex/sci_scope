revised_title: The Effects of Caffeine and Theine on Voluntary Muscle Rigor
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Physiology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of caffeine and theine on voluntary muscle
  rigor in frogs. Both substances cause rigor, but theine appears to be slightly more
  potent. Theine can also induce rhythmic contractions in the muscle. The results
  suggest that caffeine and theine may have different actions on the nervous system,
  with theine tending to produce more rhythmic contractions.
