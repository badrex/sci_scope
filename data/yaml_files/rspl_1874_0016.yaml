revised_title: The Effect of Seasonal Temperature Changes on Ocean Water
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Oceanography & Climate
tldr: The author investigates the impact of seasonal temperature changes on ocean
  water, particularly in the North Atlantic. They observe that as summer approaches,
  surface water warms and becomes lighter, while deeper water cools. In winter, the
  colder surface water sinks, distributing its higher temperature among lower layers
  of colder water. This process results in a vertical diffusion of heat, with greater
  depth penetration in regions with larger yearly temperature ranges.
