revised_title: Challenging the Assumption of Vapour Conversion to Liquid State
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author, Dionysius Lardner, challenges the common belief that compressing
  aqueous vapor would convert it into the liquid state. He argues that this assumption
  contradicts the doctrine of latent heat and the results of experiments showing that
  the same amount of heat is needed to convert water into steam under any pressure.
  Lardner proposes that steam can be indefinitely compressed and expanded without
  turning into a liquid, and its temperature depends on the pressure it has acquired
  through compression or expansion.
