revised_title: On the Combinations of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygen and Their Chemical
  Relations to Inflammable Bodies
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Compounds
tldr: Humphry Davy investigates the combinations of oxymuriatic gas and oxygen, discovering
  their chemical relations to inflammable bodies. He also explores the properties
  of these substances and compares them to oxygen, finding that they share a close
  analogy. Davy proposes new names for oxymuriatic gas and its compounds to aid in
  scientific discussion and understanding.
