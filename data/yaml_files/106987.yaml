revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Properties Attributed to Light
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author conducts experiments to determine if chemical properties are present
  in light. By exposing gold and silver oxides to sunlight and heat, the author observes
  color changes in materials, suggesting that heat generated by light may be responsible
  for these transformations.
