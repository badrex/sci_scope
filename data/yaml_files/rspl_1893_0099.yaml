revised_title: Bubble Dynamics and Fluid Resistance in Annular Channels
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of bubbles in annular channels and their
  velocity, resistance, and shape. They observe that the velocity of bubbles decreases
  as the air volume increases, and the bubble shapes change accordingly. The study
  also shows that the resistance of the annular channel to the flow of liquid is related
  to the driving pressure.
