revised_title: Investigating the Error in Standards of Linear Measure Due to Bar Thickness
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Measurement & Metrology
tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discovers a source of error in linear measure standards
  arising from the thickness of the bar on which they are traced. He explains the
  cause of this error and describes a method to almost entirely obviate the issue,
  ensuring more accurate measurements in the future.
