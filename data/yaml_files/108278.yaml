revised_title: Investigating the Voltaic Action of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Hydrocarbons
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy Storage
tldr: The author explores the voltaic action of phosphorus, sulphur, and hydrocarbons
  in gas voltaic batteries, discovering that phosphorus can act as a permanent voltaic
  excitant when combined with nitrogen and oxygen. This finding demonstrates the first
  instance of a solid, insoluble non-conductor being used to excite a continuous voltaic
  current.
