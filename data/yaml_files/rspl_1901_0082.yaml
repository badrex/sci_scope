scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author examines the pelvic plexus in Acanthias vulgaris, a species of shark,
  and finds a significant amount of variation in the number and position of the nerves
  forming the pelvic plexus. This study aims to understand the range of these variations
  and their potential implications for theories explaining limb variations in different
  species and within the same species.
