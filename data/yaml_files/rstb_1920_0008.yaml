tldr: The author examines seven ancient flint implements found in river-terrace gravels
  and discusses their transition from rostro-carinate to tongue-shaped forms. These
  implements, which exhibit a beak-like appearance, are determined to be of early
  Paleolithic age based on their form, color, and condition, as well as their association
  with other implements of similar characteristics.
