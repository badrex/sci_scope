tldr: This paper explores the third elliptic integral and its applications in dynamical
  problems, such as Poinsot's herpolhode and the motion of symmetrical tops. The author
  presents a method to calculate the coefficients and provides a complete discussion
  of various mechanical problems using elliptic functions.
