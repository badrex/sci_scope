revised_title: Investigation of the Spectrum of Magnesium Hydride and its Presence
  in Sunspot Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of magnesium hydride and its presence in
  the sunspot spectrum. They confirm the identification of magnesium hydride in the
  sunspot spectrum and demonstrate that many bright interruptions in the dark background
  of the spot spectrum are not bright lines but clear interspaces between lines or
  groups of lines in the spectrum of magnesium hydride.
