scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Classical Mechanics & Newtonian Physics
tldr: The author, Isaac Milner, reflects on the communication of motion by impact
  and gravity, discussing the differences in opinions on the subject and the importance
  of understanding the laws of motion for practical applications. He highlights the
  need for a clear understanding of Newton's third law of motion and the potential
  for confusion in its interpretation.
