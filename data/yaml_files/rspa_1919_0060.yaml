revised_title: A Linear Associative Algebra for Electromagnetic Relations and Theory
  of Relativity
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetic Theory & Relativity
tldr: The authors propose a linear associative algebra based on four fundamental units,
  which can express vector formulae of Minkowski and electromagnetic relations in
  a simple manner. They interpret the units as mutually rectangular unit vectors in
  four-dimensional space and demonstrate how this algebra can be used to represent
  and manipulate electromagnetic concepts, including Maxwell's equations, in the context
  of the theory of relativity.
