revised_title: On the Osmotic Pressures of Concentrated Aqueous Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the osmotic pressures of concentrated aqueous solutions
  and describe their experimental methods and apparatus. They discuss the differences
  between osmotic 'force' and equilibrium pressures and provide detailed descriptions
  of their findings.
topics:
- Osmotic pressure
- Concentrated solutions
- Equilibrium pressures
- Van der Waals equation
- Membrane separation
