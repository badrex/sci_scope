revised_title: 'On the Scattering and Absorption of Light in Gaseous Media: Applications
  to Sky Radiation Intensity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the scattering and absorption of light in gaseous media,
  focusing on the intensity of sky radiation. They develop a general integral equation
  to describe the scattered radiation and consider the effects of temperature changes
  and selective absorption. The study has applications to understanding the attenuation
  of sunlight in Earth's atmosphere.
