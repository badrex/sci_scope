revised_title: Investigation of a New Kind of Glow from Palladium in Vacuum Tubes
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Properties of Materials
tldr: The authors investigate a new kind of glow produced from palladium in vacuum
  tubes and explore its properties, including the effect of heat, electric fields,
  and gases in the tube. They find that the glow is not influenced by electric or
  magnetic fields, but is affected by the temperature of the tube walls and the presence
  of gases produced from the heated palladium.
