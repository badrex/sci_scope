revised_title: On the Existence of Converging Sequences in Oscillating Successions
  of Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author demonstrates that oscillating successions of functions can contain
  converging sequences, and provides theorems for when these sequences exist. The
  results apply to successions of integrals and functions of bounded variation, with
  the limiting functions being upper or lower semi-continuous.
