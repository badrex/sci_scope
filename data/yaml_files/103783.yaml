tldr: The author examines Signor Valsalva's discovery of an excretory duct from the
  glandula renalis to the epididymis and attempts to replicate the experiment. Despite
  not finding the duct, the author suggests that a branch of the artery may have been
  mistaken for it due to similarities in appearance.
