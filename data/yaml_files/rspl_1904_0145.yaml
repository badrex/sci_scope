revised_title: The Impact of Momentary Stresses on Metals
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The author investigates the effects of momentary stresses on metals, particularly
  iron and copper wires, and finds that they can be stressed beyond their elastic
  limit and breaking loads for short durations without losing their proportionality
  of stresses and strains.

- Mechanics
- Metallurgy
- Wave Propagation
- Elasticity
- Impulse Stress
