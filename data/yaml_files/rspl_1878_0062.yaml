scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Statistics
tldr: Sir William Thomson presents a harmonic analyzer, a new instrument capable of
  analyzing tidal and meteorological data. The machine can simultaneously analyze
  mean lunar and mean solar semi-diurnal tides, as well as other tidal constituents.
  It is suitable for meteorological work and is handed over to the Meteorological
  Office for practical use.
