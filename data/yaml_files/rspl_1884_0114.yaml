revised_title: The Extensive Corrosive Effects of Tidal Streams on Metals During the
  Diffusion of Salt and Fresh Water
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geochemistry & Environmental Geochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effects of tidal streams on metals during the diffusion
  of salt and fresh water, discovering that a diffusing mixture of salt and fresh
  water can cause significantly more corrosion than sea water alone. The study demonstrates
  the extensive corrosive effects of tidal streams on metals, with losses varying
  from 15% to 50% depending on the metal type.
