scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Paleontology
tldr: The author investigates the geometrical forms of turbinated and discoid shells,
  discovering that their generating figures follow a logarithmic spiral pattern. This
  spiral pattern allows for the expansion of the shell's spiral chamber and the growth
  of the operculum, suggesting a simple geometrical law governing shell formation.
