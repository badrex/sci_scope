tldr: The author reports on an astronomical expedition to Teneriffe in 1857, focusing

  study found that telescopic vision improved significantly at higher altitudes, with
  the best results at 10,702 feet. The author also discusses the impact of atmospheric
  conditions, such as dry, hazy, or dusty strata, on telescopic vision and the importance
  of altitude in overcoming these obstacles.
