scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates internal and external division in the calculus of symbols,
  focusing on functions of any degree n in r divided internally and externally by
  another function of any other degree m in ~r. The study provides the terms of the
  quotient, their laws of derivation, and the final remainder, along with conditions
  for the divisor to be a factor of the dividend.
