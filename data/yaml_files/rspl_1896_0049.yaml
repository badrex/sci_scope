revised_title: Magnetic Permeability of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Air
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: Fleming and Dewar investigate the magnetic properties of liquid oxygen and liquid
  air, using a closed circuit transformer to measure their magnetic permeability and
  susceptibility. They find that liquid oxygen exhibits remarkable magnetic properties
  and that these properties change when the liquid is converted to gaseous oxygen
  at the same temperature.
