revised_title: Histological Analysis of Uredo dispersa and the Mycoplasm Hypothesis
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Pathology & Mycology
tldr: The author examines the histological features of Uredo dispersa's germination,
  infection, and growth in grass tissues. The research refutes Eriksson's Mycoplasm
  hypothesis, showing that the supposed infective substance is actually the cut-off
  haustoria of the fungus.
