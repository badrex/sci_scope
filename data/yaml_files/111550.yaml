revised_title: 'Stratifications in Electrical Discharges in Torricellian and Other
  Vacua: Second Communication'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Phenomena
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of electrical discharges in various vacua,
  including Torricellian and carbonic acid vacua, and observes the formation of stratifications.
  The experiments reveal that the nature of the vacuum and the presence of certain
  gases affect the appearance and behavior of the stratifications.
