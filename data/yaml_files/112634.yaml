scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Architecture
tldr: This study investigates the stability of various dome forms, including Gothic,
  parabolic, elliptical, and ogival domes, and provides formulas for calculating the
  thrust and determining the weakest joint in each type. The author also discusses
  the potential use of iron belts to counteract thrust and reduce the thickness of
  supporting piers.
