revised_title: The Spark Spectrum of Argon in the Spark Spectrum of Air
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the spark spectrum of argon as it appears in the spark
  spectrum of air, examining the conditions that yield the brightest and purest spectrum
  of argon. The study provides a table of lines in the red and blue spectra of argon,
  comparing them to the spectrum of air, and discusses the possibility of argon being
  an element or a compound.
