revised_title: A Revised Theory of the Precession of the Equinoxes
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: The author revisits Sir Isaac Newton's theory on the precession of the equinoxes
  and provides a new solution using Newton's principles. The precession is determined
  to be approximately 21' 6", with the difference between the theory and observed
  values potentially due to factors such as the earth's fluidity, density, or the
  ratio of diameters.
