revised_title: 'Thermal Ionization from Carbon: The Influence of Gaseous Atmosphere'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the origin of thermal ionization from carbon and examines
  the influence of a gaseous atmosphere on the ionization process. The study suggests
  that the presence of a gaseous atmosphere can affect the number of ions collected
  by the positive electrode through mechanical interference and direct combination
  of electrons with gas molecules.
