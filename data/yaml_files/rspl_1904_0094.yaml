revised_title: The Absorption and Thermal Evolution of Gases in Charcoal at Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the absorption and thermal evolution of gases in charcoal
  at low temperatures, using liquid air as a calorimetric agent. The experiments reveal
  that the amount of gas occluded in charcoal is significantly increased at low temperatures,
  and the heat evolved is greater than the amount required for liquefaction in some
  cases.
