revised_title: 'The Discharge of Electricity through Gases: A Review of the Theory
  of Electrolytic Convection'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author reviews the theory of electrolytic convection, which posits that
  gases insulate when no free ions are present and conduct when molecules are split
  into ions. The theory offers explanations for various phenomena, including the discharge
  through gases rising from flames, and the discharge introduced by strong electromotive
  forces.
topics:
- Electric Discharge in Gases
- Electrolytic Convection
