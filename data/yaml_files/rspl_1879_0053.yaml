revised_title: Investigating Short Periods Common to Solar and Terrestrial Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climate Science
tldr: The authors analyze temperature ranges, magnetic declination, and sunspot activity
  data to identify short periods common to solar and terrestrial phenomena. They find
  evidence of these periods in temperature and magnetic data from Kew Observatory,
  Toronto, Utrecht, and Prague, suggesting a connection between solar and terrestrial
  events.
topics:
- Solar physics
- Terrestrial physics
- Meteorology
- Magnetic declination
- Sunspot activity
