tldr: Samuel B. Howlett presents a compensating barometer that requires no corrections
  for zero or temperature, making it suitable for meteorological purposes. The instrument
  consists of two mercury-filled tubes, and its readings are adjusted by a float and
  an ivory scale. This design allows for more accurate and efficient measurements
  in comparison to a standard barometer.
