  Crustaceans'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Behavior
tldr: This study investigates the tonal sense in the crustacean Gammarus pulex, discovering
  that it responds to specific tones, particularly the bass note of the B flat. The
  response is observed through the flexing of the first antennae, suggesting that
  the auditory function is located in these appendages.
