  Rana Species
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author examines the urinary organs and urine composition of two species
  of the genus Rana, the bull-frog and the brown-toad. The study reveals that the
  urine of these animals contains urea and suggests that the urinary secretion depends
  on the organ's structure rather than the diet of the animals.
