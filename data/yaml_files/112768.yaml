scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author corrects an error in the theory of irreducible covariants in binary
  quintics, showing that the number of these covariants is finite. The new theory
  accounts for the interconnection of syzygies and provides new formulae to separate
  covariants according to their order in the variables.
