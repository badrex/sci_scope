revised_title: Investigating the Relations between the Cerebellar and Other Nervous
  System Centres

scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurobiology
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the cerebellum and other parts
  of the nervous system, specifically focusing on the action of antagonistic muscles.
  They find that excitation of the cerebellum causes a distinct relaxation of the
  triceps and contraction of the biceps when the 'acerebral' tonus is established,
  indicating a central effect.
