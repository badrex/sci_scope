revised_title: On the Method of Variation of Parameters in Physical Astronomy
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Dynamics
tldr: This paper discusses the method of variation of parameters in the investigation
  of perturbations in the solar system. The authors explore the application of this
  method to both secular and periodical inequalities, and compare it to other methods
  of solution. The paper concludes that Mr. Lubbock's work is worthy of being printed
  in the Transactions.
