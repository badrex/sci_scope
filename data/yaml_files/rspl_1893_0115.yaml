tldr: This article discusses the nature of mycetoma, a chronic inflammation disease,
  and presents various views on its causative agents. The authors propose that the
  black and white particles found in mycetoma are due to the transformation of large,
  branching, septate fungi and lowly organized fungi, respectively, and that both
  are pathogenic.
