scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author presents various instruments and processes for investigating the
  laws of electric currents and determining the constants of a voltaic circuit. These
  methods help in ascertaining the most advantageous conditions for producing electric
  effects through circuits of great extent, enabling the communication of signals
  through electric currents over considerable distances.
