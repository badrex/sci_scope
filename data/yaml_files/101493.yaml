revised_title: Navigational Problems and the Identity of Artificial Tangent-line and
  Meridian-line
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geography & Cartography
tldr: The author presents certain problems related to navigation and proposes a rule
  to determine the identity of the artificial tangent-line and the meridian-line.
  This rule could potentially lead to more precise navigation, easier logarithmic
  calculations, and a new method for drawing the meridian line geometrically.
topics:
- Navigation
- Geometric Optics
- Tangents
- Meridional Parts
- Logarithmic Calculations
