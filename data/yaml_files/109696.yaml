scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: Dr. William Henry investigates the decomposition of ammonia through combustion
  with oxygen and other gases. He discovers that when an intermediate quantity of
  oxygen is used, ammonia is consumed entirely, and the remaining hydrogen and nitrogen
  are in a gaseous state. The proportion of hydrogen to nitrogen in ammonia is found
  to be approximately 70:6.
