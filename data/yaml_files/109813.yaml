revised_title: Fossil Remains of an Animal More Nearly Allied to Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Paleobiology & Evolutionary Biology
tldr: The author describes the fossil remains of an animal closely related to fish,
  found in Dorsetshire. The animal's skeletal features, such as its jaw and eye structure,
  suggest it was a swimming creature. Its unique characteristics, which resemble both
  fish and other remote animal classes, make it an important link in the chain of
  evolutionary gradations.
