revised_title: Chemical Interpretation of Mendelian Factors for Flower-Colour in Antirrhinum
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Plant Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical basis of Mendelian factors for flower color
  in Antirrhinum, identifying the ivory pigment as apigenin and the yellow pigment
  as luteolin. They also suggest that anthocyanins are derived from flavones, with
  individual anthocyanins differing based on the flavone they are derived from.
