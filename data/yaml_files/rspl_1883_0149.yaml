scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author conducts experiments on a monkey to investigate the relationship
  between the cervical sympathetic and the dilation of the pupil. They find that the
  dilator fibers of the iris are derived from the anterior root of the second dorsal
  nerve, providing insight into the nervous system's role in pupil dilation.
