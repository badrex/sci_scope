scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author discusses the relationship between atmospheric pressure and the ascent
  of vapors, proposing that changes in atmospheric pressure can explain the formation
  of clouds and precipitation. The author also explores the connection between wind
  and atmospheric pressure, suggesting that sudden changes in wind direction can lead
  to rain.
