scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: Bunsen and Roscoe investigate the optical and chemical extinction of chemical
  rays, discovering that the amount of light absorbed by a medium varies directly
  with the intensity of the light. They also find that the coefficient of extinction
  for chlorine is different for various sources of light, suggesting that chemical
  rays possess both quantitative and qualitative differences.
