revised_title: 'Experimental Contributions to the Theory of Electrolysis: Polarization
  of Molecules in Electrolytes'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the polarization of molecules in electrolytes and demonstrates
  that an electrolyte can be regarded as a conductor whose molecules are capable of
  exchanging their constituents during discharge. The experiments conducted show differences
  in polarization between the two electrodes and provide support for Grotthus's and
  Faraday's theories.
