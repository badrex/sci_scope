revised_title: 'Portland Experiments on the Flow of Oil in Tubes: Investigating the
  Critical Velocity of Fluids'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors conduct experiments on the flow of oil in tubes to determine the
  critical velocity at which fluid flow transitions from steady to turbulent. They
  find that the critical velocity is influenced by the kinematic viscosity and pipe
  radius, and that their results align with previous findings for water flow.
topics:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Flow Resistance
- Turbulence
- Pipe Flow
- Viscosity
