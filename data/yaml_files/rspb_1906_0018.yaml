revised_title: The Mechanism of Intraocular Fluid Production and Its Relation to Intraocular
  Pressure
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Physiology
tldr: The authors investigate the factors that determine the production and absorption
  of intraocular fluid, focusing on the role of ciliary processes and the balance
  between formation and absorption in maintaining intraocular pressure. They also
  explore the effects of changes in blood pressure on intraocular fluid production.
