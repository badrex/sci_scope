tldr: Four miners were trapped in a coal mine for 24 days without food, surviving
  solely on water from a nearby spring. Upon rescue, they were found to be in good
  health, despite the lack of sustenance. The water they consumed was found to contain
  only a minimal amount of calcium, suggesting it may have played a role in their
  survival.
