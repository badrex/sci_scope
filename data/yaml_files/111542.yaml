revised_title: Challenging the Existing Theory of Gunpowder's Action
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanics & Materials Science
tldr: The author critiques the existing theory of gunpowder's action and presents
  new experiments to support his alternative theory. He argues that the initial force
  of gunpowder is impulsive and that the current theory, which focuses on the elasticity
  of the fluid, is insufficient. He also suggests that quick-burning powder is better
  for smaller ordnance and that the strength of metal in large guns is not diminished
  as previously thought.
