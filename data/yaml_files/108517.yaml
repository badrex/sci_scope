revised_title: The Discovery of a Third Element of Strength in Beams Subjected to
  Transverse Strain
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Civil Engineering & Structural Design
tldr: The author conducts experiments on beams to determine the position of the neutral
  axis and discovers a third element of strength, which he names 'Resistance of Flexure,'
  that significantly contributes to the overall strength of beams subjected to transverse
  strain.
