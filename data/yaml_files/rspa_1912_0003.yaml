revised_title: Confirmation of Monatomicity in Neon, Krypton, and Xenon
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: Sir William Ramsay investigates the monatomicity of neon, krypton, and xenon
  by measuring their specific heat ratios and densities. The results show that these
  gases, like helium and argon, must be considered monatomic, with their molecular
  and atomic weights being identical.
