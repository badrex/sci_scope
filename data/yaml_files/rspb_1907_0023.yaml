revised_title: 'Cyanogenesis in Plants: Phaseolunatin and Associated Enzymes in Flax,
  Cassava, and the ''Lima Bean'''
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Biochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the cyanogenesis process in plants, specifically focusing
  on phaseolunatin and the associated enzymes in flax, cassava, and the 'Lima bean.'
  They find that the enzyme associated with phaseolunatin in these plants is a mixture
  of emulsin and maltase, with the decomposition of phaseolunatin due to the action
  of the latter.
