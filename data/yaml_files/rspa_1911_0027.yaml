revised_title: Experimental Evidence of Secondary Gamma-Rays Produced by Beta-Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Nuclear & Particle Physics
tldr: The author investigates the production of secondary gamma-rays by exposing radioactive
  materials to beta-rays and measuring the resulting ionization. The experiments show
  that the majority of the secondary gamma-rays are produced by the impact of beta-rays
  on external materials, rather than being emitted directly from the radioactive atoms.
