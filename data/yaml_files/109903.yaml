revised_title: Investigations on Blood Coagulation and Tubular Structure
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Hematology & Blood Disorders
tldr: The author, Sir Everard Home, investigates the changes blood undergoes during
  coagulation and the formation of tubular structures. He provides a more accurate
  measurement of blood globules and demonstrates that the extraction of air causes
  the tubular structure observed in coagulated blood. He also explores the similarities
  between blood coagulation and pus vascularization, which has implications for practical
  surgery.
