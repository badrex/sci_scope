scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Trigonometry
tldr: The article presents a method for calculating meridional parts in spheroids
  with the same precision as in a sphere. The rule involves using logarithmic tangents
  and the semidiameter of the equator to find the meridional parts for a given latitude.
