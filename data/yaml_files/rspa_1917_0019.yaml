revised_title: On the Cesaro Convergence of Restricted Fourier Series
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Calculus
tldr: The author investigates the conditions required for the ordinary convergence
  of restricted Fourier series and introduces a new theory involving the Cesaro convergence
  of these series. The study focuses on cases where the associated function fails
  to be an integral at specific points, and the author provides several theorems and
  examples to support the theory.
topics:
- Fourier series
- Cesaro convergence
- Mathematical analysis
- Summability
- Integration theorems
