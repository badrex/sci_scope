revised_title: The Duration of Luminosity of Electric Discharge in Gases and Vapours
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Optical Properties of Materials
tldr: The author investigates the persistence of luminosity in electric discharges
  in gases and vapours, using various experimental methods and observing the effects
  of different elements. The findings reveal that the duration of luminosity depends
  on factors such as the type of metal used, the presence of volatile electrodes,
  and the pressure within the experimental setup.
