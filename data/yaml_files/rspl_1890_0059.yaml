revised_title: Ellipsoidal Harmonics and Their Applications
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Analysis
tldr: The author develops the subject of ellipsoidal harmonics from their expressions
  in Cartesian coordinates, investigating their properties and applications in potential
  theory, magnetism, and electrical capacitance. The paper also includes a brief discussion
  of spheroidal harmonics and their relationship to spherical harmonics.
topics:
- Ellipsoidal Harmonics
- Spherical Harmonics
- Potential Theory
- Magnetism
- Electrical Capacitance
