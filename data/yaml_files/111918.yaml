revised_title: Improvement in Measuring Electric Resistance
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring electric resistance using an
  electrodynamic balance, which eliminates errors caused by uncertainty in connections.
  This method can be applied to various types of electrical standards, providing a
  more accurate way to measure resistance.
