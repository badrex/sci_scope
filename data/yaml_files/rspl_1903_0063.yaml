revised_title: Investigation of Magnetic Expansion in Less Magnetic Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic expansion of various metals, including
  bismuth, silver, aluminum, copper, zinc, brass, bronze, lead, and tin, and finds
  no significant expansion or contraction within the limits of the experiment. The
  study challenges the assumption that there is a direct relation between magnetic
  susceptibility and magnetic expansion in metals.
