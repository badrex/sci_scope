revised_title: On the Velocity and Heating Effect of Crookes' Cathode Stream
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: Lord Kelvin investigates the velocity and heating effect of Crookes' cathode
  stream, using assumptions to calculate the temperature rise and pressure of the
  stream. He concludes that the results align with some of Crookes' experiments and
  that the optical color test is not a valid objection to the cathode stream theory.
