  Negro and European
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neuroanatomy
tldr: The author, Frederick Tiedemann, examines the brain structure and weight of
  both Europeans and Negroes, finding no significant differences in their average
  weight or size. He also refutes the idea of innate intellectual differences between
  the two groups, attributing the apparent inferiority of the Negro to the demoralizing
  effects of slavery and oppression.
