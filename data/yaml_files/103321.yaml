revised_title: Investigating the Ascent and Suspension of Water in Capillary Tubes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to understand the cause of water
  ascent and suspension in capillary tubes. They conclude that the attraction of the
  periphery or section of the tube's surface, to which the water's upper surface is
  contiguous, is the primary cause of this phenomenon.
