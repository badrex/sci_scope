revised_title: The Use of Hemolytic Isolysins for Identifying Individuals in Cattle
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Pathology
tldr: The authors investigate the use of hemolytic isolysins in identifying individual
  cattle by examining the immune response to Rinderpest. They find that serum from
  immune cattle can be used to differentiate between individual animals based on their
  red blood corpuscles' susceptibility to hemolysis.
