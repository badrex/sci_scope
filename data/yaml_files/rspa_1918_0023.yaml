revised_title: Crystallographic Properties of Monoclinic Double Selenates in the Iron
  Group
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the crystallographic properties of monoclinic double
  selenates in the iron group, confirming the progression of crystal properties with
  atomic weight and atomic number. The research also reveals that the ammonium salt
  is isomorphous but not eutropic with the alkali metallic salts, meaning it shares
  a similar structure but does not have the same properties.
