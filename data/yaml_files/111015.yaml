tldr: The author examines the movements of the stomach and the physiology of intestinal
  obstructions, concluding that peristaltic movements are responsible for propelling
  contents through the digestive system. The study also highlights the role of obstruction
  in affecting peristalsis and the nature of the distending fluid.
