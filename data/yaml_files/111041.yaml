revised_title: Magnetic Variation and the Microscopic Structure of Fish Scales
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences & Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Oceanography
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic variation in the Atlantic Ocean between
  60° N and 60° S latitudes and discusses the structure and growth of fish scales,
  particularly in ganoid and placoid fish. The study contributes to understanding
  the development of fish bones and the role of microscopic structures in distinguishing
  species and establishing affinities.
