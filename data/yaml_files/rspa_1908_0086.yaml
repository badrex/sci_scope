tldr: The authors conducted a complete redetermination of the equilibria of the lead-tin
  system using pyrometric and microscopic methods. They discovered that the eutectic
  point is at a concentration of 63% tin instead of 69%, and found a series of transformations
  in solid alloys near the lead end of the series. The study of cooling-curves and
  microstructure led to the equilibrium diagram presented in the paper, which differs
  from the one published by Roberts-Austen.
