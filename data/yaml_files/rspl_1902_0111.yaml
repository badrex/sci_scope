revised_title: Discovery of Dextrorotatory Optical Activity in Hemoglobin
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
tldr: The authors investigate the optical activity of hemoglobin and discover that
  it is dextrorotatory, contrary to previous beliefs that all albuminous substances
  were levorotatory. This finding expands our understanding of the properties and
  behavior of hemoglobin, a complex protein with significant physiological and chemical
  interest.
