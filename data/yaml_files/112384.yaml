revised_title: The Effect of Solid Nuclei on Boiling Liquids
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the role of solid nuclei in the boiling process and
  finds that porous bodies, such as charcoal, can efficiently separate vapor from
  boiling liquids due to their ability to absorb gases. This research helps define
  the conditions for soubresauts and provides a remedy for them.
