revised_title: Direct Production of Characteristic Röntgen Radiations by Cathode Particles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Radiation
tldr: The authors investigate the direct production of characteristic Röntgen radiations
  by cathode particles and find that the majority of the effect is due to a direct
  transformation of the energy of the cathode rays into characteristic X-rays, with
  a small remainder due to indirect action.
