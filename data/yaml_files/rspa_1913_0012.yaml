revised_title: The Impact of Junctions on the Transmission of Electric Waves Along
  Conductors
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Wave Propagation
tldr: The author investigates the effect of junctions on the propagation of electric
  waves along conductors, finding that the reflected wave decreases as the conductor's
  length decreases. The study provides insight into the guidance of electric waves
  by conductors and the conditions under which this guidance occurs.
