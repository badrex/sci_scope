revised_title: Magnetism of Iron Ships and Its Accordance with Theory
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Marine Engineering & Naval Architecture
tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of iron ships and their correspondence
  with theory. He examines the magnetic condition of iron ships, their magnetic distribution,
  and how it changes with mechanical action and new positions. The author also discusses
  the implications of these findings on compass disturbances and changes in iron ships.
