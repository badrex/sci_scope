revised_title: Thermometrical Experiments and Observations on the Effect of Light
  and Color on Temperature
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The author conducts experiments with two thermometers to investigate the effect
  of light and color on temperature. They find that blackened thermometers show a
  higher temperature when exposed to sunlight or strong daylight, and that the intensity
  of heat decreases at a different rate than the intensity of light when measured
  at various distances from a lamp flame.
