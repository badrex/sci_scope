revised_title: Quantitative Spectroscopic Experiments on Sodium Vapour
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the expansion of sodium lines in a heated environment
  and explore the relationship between the width of the lines and the thickness, density,
  and temperature of the vapours. They also study the behavior of iron and sodium
  in a heated state, discovering that iron has a unique interaction with sodium vapour,
  which affects the expansion of the bright D line.
