revised_title: The Influence of Intra-Venous Injection of Sugar on Blood Gases and
  Nerve Symptoms
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the effects of intra-venous sugar injection on blood
  gases and nerve symptoms in dogs. The study shows that sugar injection causes a
  temporary decrease in carbonic acid and oxygen levels in the blood, and can lead
  to nerve symptoms such as vomiting, tremors, and epileptic fits. The results suggest
  that sugar metabolism has a significant impact on blood composition and can cause
  temporary disturbances in the nervous system.
