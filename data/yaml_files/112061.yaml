revised_title: Magnetic Declination Observations in Lisbon from 1858 to 1863
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Magnetism
tldr: The author presents a table of the mean declination of the magnet in each decade
  from January 1858 to December 1863, derived from observations made at the Magnetic
  Observatory in Lisbon. The table shows the annual variation or semiannual inequality
  to which the magnetic element is subject, confirming the east-west shift of the
  magnet's north end depending on the sun's position relative to the equator.
