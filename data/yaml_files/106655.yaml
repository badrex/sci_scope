scientific_subdiscipline: Chemical Reactions & Analysis
tldr: Henry Cavendish and John Mc Nab conducted experiments to study the freezing
  points and types of congelation in nitrous and vitriolic acids. They discovered
  that spirit of nitre is subject to two types of congelation, aqueous and spirituous,
  and determined the freezing points corresponding to different acid strengths.
