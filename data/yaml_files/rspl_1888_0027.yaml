revised_title: The Effect of Occluded Gases on Thermo-Electric Properties of Bodies
  and Thermo-Electric Properties of Graphite and Carbon
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the effect of occluded gases on the thermo-electric
  properties of various materials, particularly focusing on graphite and carbon. The
  experiments reveal that occluded gases can significantly impact the thermo-electric
  properties of these materials, with oxygen and hydrogen causing changes in resistance
  and current flow.
