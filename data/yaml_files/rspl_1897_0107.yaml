revised_title: Chemical Analysis of Suprarenal Capsules in Elasmobranch Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Endocrinology & Hormones
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical composition of suprarenal capsules in Elasmobranch
  fishes and find that they contain a chromogen with the same chemical nature as that
  found in mammalian medulla. This suggests a possible complex molecule structure
  for the active material and its close association with the chromogen.
