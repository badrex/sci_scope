revised_title: Anastomosis of Nerves and Restoration of Paralyzed Muscles in Dogs
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurology
tldr: The author investigates the restoration of paralyzed muscles in dogs through
  nerve anastomosis. By connecting the nerves supplying limb muscles, the study demonstrates
  that coordinated movements can be regained, with recovery occurring faster when
  the nerve supply of the antagonistic group is utilized. The research also reveals
  that the cortical area corresponding to the eliminated nerve supply becomes inexcitable,
  while the other area controls both groups of muscles.
