scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Developmental Biology
tldr: The author, William B. Carpenter, explores the connection between vital and
  physical forces, arguing that they are correlated and that all vital forces are
  manifestations of one vital force. He demonstrates this through the example of the
  nervous force and its correlation to electricity, heat, light, chemical affinity,
  and mechanical motion.
