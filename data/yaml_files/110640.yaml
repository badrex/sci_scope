revised_title: Investigating the Efficiency and Effects of a Large Constant Battery
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Batteries
tldr: John Frederic Daniell investigates the efficiency and effects of a large constant
  battery, constructing a battery with 70 cells in a single series. He observes the
  transfer of charcoal between electrodes, the effects of magnetic poles on the flame,
  and the intense heat and light produced. Daniell also discusses experiments on the
  evolution of mixed gases from water under high pressure, with plans to pursue further
  research in the future.
