revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Molecular Structure and Density
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Elemental Analysis
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between molecular structure and density
  using spectroscopy. They discover that different degrees of dissociating power produce
  different spectral effects, and that increasing temperature breaks up elemental
  matter into more complex masses, as observed through the spectroscope.
