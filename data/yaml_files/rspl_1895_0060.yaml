revised_title: Development and Embryonic Fission in Lichenopora verrucaria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Invertebrate Biology
tldr: The authors study the development of Lichenopora verrucaria, focusing on the
  process of embryonic fission and the role of the polypide in the healthy development
  of embryos. They observe that the size of the colony and the extent of ovicell or
  embryo development are related, and that the occurrence of embryonic fission is
  a fundamental phenomenon in Cyclostomata.
