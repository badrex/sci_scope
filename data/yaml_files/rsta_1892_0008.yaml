revised_title: Simultaneous Measurement of Stress and Strain in Liquids Under Tension
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors develop a method to measure both stress and strain in liquids under
  tension, using ethyl-alcohol as a test subject. They find that liquids can stably
  exist in a state of tension without any breach of physical continuity, providing
  evidence to support this phenomenon.
