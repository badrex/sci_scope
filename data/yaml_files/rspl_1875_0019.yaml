revised_title: 'The Effect of Light on Tellurium and Selenium: Sensitivity and Illuminating
  Power'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Nanotechnology
tldr: The author investigates the effect of light on tellurium and selenium, discovering
  that exposure to light causes a decrease in resistance. The sensitivity of tellurium
  and selenium to light is also studied, revealing that the change in resistance is
  directly proportional to the square root of the illuminating power.
