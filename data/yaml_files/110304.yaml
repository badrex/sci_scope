revised_title: A Method of Determining Longitude Using Moon's Right Ascension
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrogeodesy & Navigation
tldr: The author presents a method for determining longitude using the moon's right
  ascension as an element. This method is an extension of his previous work and offers
  greater practical convenience than the ordinary method of lunar distances. With
  the help of a chronometer showing approximate mean time at Greenwich, the longitude
  of any given place can be determined with a high degree of accuracy.
