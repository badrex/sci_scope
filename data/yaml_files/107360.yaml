revised_title: The Influence of Spinal Marrow on the Action of the Heart in Fishes
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on fish to determine the relationship
  between spinal marrow and heart function. The results show that the muscles of a
  fish can still be activated after the brain and heart are removed, but lose all
  power when the spinal marrow is destroyed. The study also reveals that the action
  of the heart continues even after the spinal marrow and brain are damaged.
