revised_title: On the Normal Series Satisfying Linear Differential Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations
tldr: The authors explore the normal series satisfying linear differential equations,
  providing methods for finding solutions using matrix theory and series of positive
  integral powers. They demonstrate the application of these methods to both systems
  with distinct roots and those with equal roots, ultimately deriving groups of integrals
  for various scenarios.
