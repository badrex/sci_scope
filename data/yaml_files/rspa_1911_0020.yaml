revised_title: On the Periodicity of Sun-Spots and its Relation to Magnetic Storms
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Solar Physics & Solar Activity
tldr: The author investigates the periodicity of sunspots and their relation to magnetic
  storms. He finds that the frequency of sunspots is subject to recurrent variations,
  including a period of 4.79 years, which is more persistent than the 11-year cycle.
  The author also discusses the connection between sunspot activity, magnetic storms,
  and the Leonides meteorites.
