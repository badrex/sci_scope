revised_title: A New Instrument for Correcting Gaseous Volume
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: The author presents a new instrument called the aerorthometer, which allows
  for the correction of gaseous volume measurements at non-standard conditions to
  standard conditions. The instrument works by comparing the levels of mercury in
  two connected tubes and providing a reading that can be used to calculate the corrected
  volume.
