tldr: Sir Charles Bell discusses his research on the nervous system, focusing on spinal
  nerves and respiratory nerves. He presents evidence for the different functions
  of various nerve classes and describes the respiratory system of nerves, which he
  believes plays a role in both motion and sensation. He also explains the supply
  of blood to these nerves and its connection to various pathological phenomena.
