tldr: This study examines the development of the thymus, epithelial bodies, and thyroid
  in marsupials, specifically Phascolarctos, Phascolomys, and Perameles. The research
  focuses on the cervical thymus and its development stages, as well as the role of
  epithelial bodies and thyroid in the marsupialia.
