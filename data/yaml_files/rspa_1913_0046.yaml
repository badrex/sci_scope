revised_title: Experimental Verification of the Recombination Coefficient of Ions
  in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the recombination of ions produced by Röntgen rays in
  gases and vapors, using Langevin's method. They measure the recombination coefficient
  and provide experimental verification of the theory, demonstrating the importance
  of diffusion in ion recombination processes.
