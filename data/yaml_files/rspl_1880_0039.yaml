revised_title: Experimental Researches into Electric Distribution in Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrolysis
tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of ions in electrolytes, specifically
  copper sulphate, and analyze the effects of temperature, current strength, and solution
  strength on the distribution. They also explore the analogies between the distribution
  of ions and static electricity and discuss the implications for electrolytic fields.
