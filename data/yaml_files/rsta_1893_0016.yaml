revised_title: On the Stellar Orientation of Greek Temples and its Connection with
  the Precession of the Equinoxes
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astroarchaeology & Cultural Astronomy
tldr: The authors examine the orientations of Greek temples and their connection with
  the amplitudes of certain stars at the time of their foundation. They attempt to
  derive the dates of the temples' foundation by considering the changes in the right
  ascension and declination of stars due to the precession of the equinoxes.
