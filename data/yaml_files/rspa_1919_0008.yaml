revised_title: Investigation of the Absorption Spectra and Ionisation Potentials of
  Calcium, Strontium, and Barium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the absorption spectra and ionisation potentials of
  calcium, strontium, and barium using a carbon arc and identify the members of the
  series v = (1/5, S)~(m, P) in their spectra. They find that the absorption is confined
  to the members of this series and measure the wavelengths of the absorption lines
  for each element.
