revised_title: Investigating the Termination of Conductors in Leyden Phials
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author conducts experiments on the Leyden phial to determine the effectiveness
  of pointed and spherical terminations in conductors, ultimately concluding that
  pointed terminations provide better protection against lightning.
