  Tubercle Bacillus

scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The author investigates the effect of light, air, and organic fluids on the
  virulence of the tubercle bacillus. The study shows that exposure to daylight and
  fresh air rapidly depletes the virulence of the bacillus, while organic fluids from
  insanitary dwellings can maintain its power for long periods. These findings provide
  insight into the transmission and prevention of tuberculosis in various environments.
