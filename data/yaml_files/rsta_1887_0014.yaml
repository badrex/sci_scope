revised_title: On the Thermal Radiation in Absolute Measure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
tldr: The authors investigate the loss of heat by radiation and convection from the
  surface of electrically conducting wires in high vacuums. They test the Stefan-Boltzmann
  law, which states that radiation of heat is proportional to the fourth power of
  the absolute temperature of the radiating surface. The authors present their experimental
  method and results, comparing them with previous research.
