revised_title: 'The Greatest Effect of Engines with Uniformly Accelerated Motions:
  A Study on Steam-Engines'
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machinery
tldr: The author investigates the maximum effect of engines with uniformly accelerated
  motions, focusing on steam-engines. The study determines the optimal load and power
  ratio for maximum efficiency, considering the inertia of the working parts and the
  type of force applied.
