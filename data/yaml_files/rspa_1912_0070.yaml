revised_title: A Study of Active Nitrogen's Energy and Ionization
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author investigates the energy emitted by active nitrogen when it reverts
  to ordinary nitrogen and compares it with the energy given out by an equivalent
  quantity of nitric oxide in a reaction. The study also examines the ionization that
  occurs during the decay of active nitrogen.
