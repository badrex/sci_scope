revised_title: 'A Dynamical Theory of Electrons and Luminiferous Medium: Part II'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium,
  focusing on the theory of electrons. He discusses the interaction between the molecules
  of matter and the aether, and how this interaction can explain various electric
  and optical phenomena. The theory is based on the electrodynamic potential function,
  first discovered and extensively applied by F. E. Neumann.
topics:
- Electrodynamics
- Aether Theory
- Electron Theory
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Optical Phenomena
