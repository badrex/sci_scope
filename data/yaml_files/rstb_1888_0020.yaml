revised_title: 'The Electric Organ of Raia Radiata: A Comparative Study with Other
  Skate Species'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: This study compares the electric organ of Raia radiata with other skate species,
  focusing on the differences in size, structure, and development. The organ in Raia
  radiata is relatively small, with less highly developed structures than those found
  in other species. The research also examines the differences in the cups' walls,
  the nerve cone, and the striated layer between the species.
