revised_title: Investigation of Chemical Dynamics and Electrochemical Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: The author investigates the chemical dynamics and electrochemical phenomena
  of various metal salt solutions interacting with different metal plates. They discover
  a law relating the chemical action to the strength of the solution and the time
  of exposure, and study the deposition of silver on a copper plate.
topics:
- Chemical Dynamics
- Electrochemistry
- Copper Electrodeposition
- Silver Deposition
- Chemical Reaction Rates
