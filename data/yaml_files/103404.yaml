revised_title: Production of Alkaline Salt from Rotten Wood
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author describes the production of a large quantity of alkaline salt from
  rotten wood by burning it. The resulting salt is strong, white, and clean, and the
  process is unique in that the decayed part of the wood yields a greater amount of
  salt than the sound part. The author also discusses the possible reasons behind
  this phenomenon, including the influence of lightning on the wood.
