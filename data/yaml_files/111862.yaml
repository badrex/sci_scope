  Diethylamine, and Triethylamine'

scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry &amp; Chemical Compounds
tldr: 'The author, A.W. Hofmann, presents a new method for separating the three ethyl-bases:
  ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine. The process involves treating anhydrous
  mixtures of the bases with anhydrous oxalate of ethyl, which converts ethylamine
  into diethyl oxamide, diethylamine into ethyl-oxamate of ethyl, and leaves triethylamine
  unaffected. The separated bases can then be obtained through distillation and reaction
  with potassa.'
