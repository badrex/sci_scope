scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: The author investigates the early development of the freshwater bivalve Pisidium
  pusillum, focusing on the formation of the mesoblast and the role of the epiblast
  and hypoblast in its development. The study provides insights into the developmental
  history of mollusks and contributes to the understanding of the origin of the middle
  layer in vertebrate embryos.
