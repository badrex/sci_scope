scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Applied Mathematics
tldr: The author investigates the contact of surfaces, specifically examining the
  contact of curves and surfaces, and explores the concept of circumaxal and uniaxal
  contact. Additionally, the author proposes a new hygrometer design using fused chloride
  of zinc or calcium to measure moisture absorption in the air.
