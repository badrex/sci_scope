revised_title: The Nutritive Conditions Affecting the Growth of Freshwater and Soil
  Protista
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Protistology
tldr: This study investigates the nutritive conditions that determine the growth of
  freshwater and soil protista, specifically Euglena viridis. The authors find that
  the presence of organic matter in the culture medium is crucial for the growth of
  these organisms, and that certain organic compounds have a greater impact on growth
  than others. The findings contribute to the understanding of the factors regulating
  the growth of protista and their role in ecosystems.
