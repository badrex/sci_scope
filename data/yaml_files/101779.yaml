revised_title: Romer's Demonstration of Light's Retardation
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Orbital Dynamics
tldr: M. Romer demonstrates that light requires time to travel, using observations
  of Jupiter's first moon. He finds that the moon appears to emerge later than expected
  when the Earth is farther from Jupiter, suggesting that light takes time to reach
  us. This discovery helps establish the concept of the finite speed of light.
