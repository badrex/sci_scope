tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Rev. John Swinton describes his observation
  of a remarkable meteor in Oxford on March 5, 1764. The meteor appeared as a white
  column ascending from the southern part of the sky and remained visible for a few
  minutes before fading. Swinton discusses the similarities and differences between

  Australes.
