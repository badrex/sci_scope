revised_title: Spectra of Carbon Compounds and the Nitrocarbon Spectrum
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of carbon compounds, particularly focusing
  on the nitrocarbon spectrum. They analyze the presence of nitrogen and carbon in
  various compounds and discuss the challenges in conducting experiments to accurately
  determine the spectra. The authors also examine the flame of cyanogen and the spark
  discharge in carbon tetrachloride, providing insights into the behavior of these
  compounds under different conditions.
