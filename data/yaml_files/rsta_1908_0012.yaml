revised_title: A New Method for Determining the Electromotive Force of the Normal
  Weston Cadmium Cell
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors develop a new current weigher and use it to determine the electromotive
  force of the normal Weston cadmium cell. They discuss historical methods of measuring
  current and present their innovative design, which allows for precise measurements
  without needing to measure length, moment of inertia, or time.
topics:
- Electromotive force
- Current weigher
- Electrochemical equivalent
- Electrodynamics
- Electromagnetic balance
