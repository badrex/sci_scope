revised_title: The Impact of Carbonic Anhydride and Other Gases on Micro-Organism
  Development
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microorganisms
tldr: The author investigates the effects of various gases, including carbonic anhydride
  and hydrogen, on the development of microorganisms such as Bacillus pyocyaneus,
  Koch's Comma Spirillum, and Finkler's Comma Spirillum. The results show that carbonic
  anhydride has a particularly detrimental effect on the vitality of these organisms,
  preventing their multiplication and in some cases causing their destruction.
