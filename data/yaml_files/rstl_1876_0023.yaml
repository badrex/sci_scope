revised_title: 'Experiments on the Friction Between Water and Air: A New Approach'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The author conducts experiments to study the friction between water and air
  using a continuous water vein and a unique apparatus. The results demonstrate that
  there is significant friction between water and air, with the motion of air caused
  by the water jet being visible and measurable.
