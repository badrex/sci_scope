tldr: Ferrier and Turner's research investigates the pathways of sensory perception
  in the brain through a series of experiments involving destructive lesions and the
  study of consecutive degenerations. They discovered the connections between the
  cerebral cortex and various sensory systems, including the visual, auditory, and
  cutaneous systems, as well as the existence of the fronto-pontine tract.
