revised_title: Force Required to Stop a Moving Electrified Sphere
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the force required to stop a moving electrified sphere
  using Heaviside's and Hertz's methods. The force is determined by analyzing the
  energy and momentum in the electro-magnetic field and the pulses generated by starting
  and stopping the sphere.
