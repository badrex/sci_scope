revised_title: Foliation and Cleavage Arrangement in Rocks of the North of Scotland
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the arrangement of foliation and cleavage in rocks of the
  North of Scotland, specifically gneiss and mica schist. He observes that foliation
  often forms great arches with the inclination of layers increasing away from the
  center, and that this pattern is similar to the arrangement of cleavage planes in
  slates.
