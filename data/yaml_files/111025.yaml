revised_title: 'Anatomy and Physiology of a New Infusory Animalcule: Notommata Subgenus'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Biology
tldr: The author, John Dalrymple, describes a new infusory animalcule related to the
  Notommata genus. He discusses its unique anatomy, including the absence of digestive
  organs, and presents a new theory on the mechanism of circulation and respiration
  in rotifers. The animalcule's transparency and observable development make it valuable
  for embryological studies.
