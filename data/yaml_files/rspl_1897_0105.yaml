revised_title: Further Determinations of Dielectric Constants of Organic Bodies and
  Electrolytes at Very Low Temperatures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Dewar and Fleming investigate the dielectric constants of various organic bodies
  and electrolytes at very low temperatures using Nernst's method. They find that
  the method provides accurate results and is a useful alternative to the previously
  used galvanometer method.
