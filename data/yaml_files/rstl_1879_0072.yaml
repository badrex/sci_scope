revised_title: On the Specific Inductive Capacities of Certain Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a series of measurements of specific inductive capacities
  of various dielectrics, including transparent materials, to test Professor Maxwell's
  electromagnetic theory. The experiments involve using a 5-plate induction balance
  to measure the effects of dielectric materials on electrical potentials, with a
  focus on overcoming the challenges of rapid experimentation and eliminating residual
  charge effects.
topics:
- Electromagnetic Theory
- Electrical Constants
