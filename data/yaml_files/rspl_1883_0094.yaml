revised_title: The Continuity of Protoplasm in Vegetable Cells
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The author investigates the continuity of protoplasm between adjacent cells
  in various plants, using staining and sectioning techniques. He finds that a continuity
  of protoplasm is established through fine threads in a sieve-structure, rather than
  through large processes. This continuity is believed to facilitate the communication
  of impulses and the transference of solid materials within the plant.
