revised_title: Stability of Loose Earth and Pressure on Vertical Surfaces
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geotechnical Engineering
tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for the stability of loose earth based
  on the laws of friction. The paper also discusses the pressure of earth against
  walls and the power of earth to support buildings, showing that the weight of a
  building supported by a horizontal bed of earth exceeds the weight of the displaced
  earth.
