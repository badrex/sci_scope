revised_title: Decomposition of Nitrogen in Ammonia by Potassium
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: Humphry Davy investigates the decomposition of nitrogen in ammonia using potassium.
  He finds that when potassium acts on ammonia, a portion of nitrogen is converted
  into oxygen and hydrogen. This research contributes to the understanding of the
  nature of certain bodies and the role of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and nitrous
  compounds in chemical reactions.
