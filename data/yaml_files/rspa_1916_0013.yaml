revised_title: Reduction of Metallic Oxides with Hydrogen at High Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The authors investigate the reduction of metallic oxides with hydrogen at high
  pressures and temperatures. They successfully reduce several oxides, including chromium
  and vanadium oxides, to their metallic forms. However, they are unable to reduce
  uranium, thorium, zirconium, and yttrium oxides under the conditions tested.
