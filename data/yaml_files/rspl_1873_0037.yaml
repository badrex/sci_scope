revised_title: On the Attraction and Repulsion of Electric Conductors and the Direction
  of Molecular Structure
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Electricity
tldr: The author conducts an experiment to determine whether attractions and repulsions
  between electric conductors are between the currents or the substances conveying
  them. The results show that the attractions and repulsions are between the substances,
  not the currents. This conclusion has implications for our understanding of molecular
  changes in bodies due to electric currents and magnetism.
