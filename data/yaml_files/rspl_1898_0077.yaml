revised_title: Carbohydrate Formation, Storage, and Depletion in Monocotyledons
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate carbohydrate formation, storage, and depletion in monocotyledonous
  plants, finding that starch formation varies greatly among species and that inulins
  are more common in plants from dry environments. They also discover that starch
  and inulin can coexist in the same cell.
