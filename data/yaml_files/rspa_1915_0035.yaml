revised_title: Equipotential Surfaces in Air near Long Walls and Buildings
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the distribution of potential near long walls and buildings,
  using the Schwarzian transformation to calculate the equipotential surfaces and
  potential gradients. The study provides insights into the effects of vertical potential
  gradients on plants and animals, as well as the measurement of atmospheric potential
  gradients.
