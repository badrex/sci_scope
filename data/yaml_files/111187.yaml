tldr: The Royal Society responds to a request from the Secretary of State for Foreign

  discuss the importance of climatological knowledge and the establishment of uniform
  systems, but ultimately conclude that pressing for uniformity is not necessary due
  to the advancements made by various countries. They express support for the proposal
  by the United States to improve the extension and systematic direction of meteorological
  observations at sea.
