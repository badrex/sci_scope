revised_title: The Influence of Nerves on Stomach Secretions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Pathophysiology
tldr: B. C. Brodie's experiments demonstrate that the secretion of gastric juice in
  the stomach is dependent on the influence of the nerves, specifically the eighth
  pair or the par vagum. The study shows that when these nerves are divided, the secretion
  of mucous and watery fluid from the stomach and intestines is suppressed, indicating
  the crucial role of the nervous system in the digestive process.
