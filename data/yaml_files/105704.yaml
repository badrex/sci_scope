tldr: The author, James Stirling, describes a remarkable darkness event that occurred
  in Detroit in 1762. The darkness lasted for most of the day, and was accompanied
  by a red, enlarged sun, dirty yellowish-green colored air, and a shower of sulfuric
  rain. Stirling suggests that the event may have been caused by a volcanic eruption
  or subterranean fire.
