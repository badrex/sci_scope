revised_title: Electrical Interference Phenomena and Their Relation to Newton's Rings
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Waves
tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena in conductors with
  varying properties, discovering a relation between these phenomena and Newton's
  rings. The study involves the reflection and transmission of electrical waves in
  conductors with abnormal parts, leading to the understanding of the coefficients
  of reflection and transmission.
