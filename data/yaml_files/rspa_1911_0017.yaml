revised_title: Investigations on the Charges and Motion of Ions in Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the charges and motion of ions in gases, focusing on
  the effects of drying and pressure on the behavior of negative ions. The study reveals
  that negative ions in dry gases assume a corpuscular state and move under different
  laws than positive ions when certain conditions are met.
