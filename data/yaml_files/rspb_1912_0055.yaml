  Histology, and Pathological Changes'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Ophthalmology & Optometry
tldr: This study investigates the effects of ultra-violet rays on the eye, focusing
  on absorption by the eye's media, histological changes in the lens and ciliary body,
  and the potential for inducing pathological changes. The research finds that certain
  ultra-violet rays are absorbed by the lens and can cause changes, while the cornea
  offers no resistance to these rays.
