revised_title: Experimental Examination of Platina and Methods for Separating Gold
  and Platina
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates the separation of gold and platina through various methods,
  including amalgamation with mercury, precipitation with alkalies, and using inflammable
  liquids. The experiments reveal that mercury has a greater affinity with gold than
  platina, and that platina can be separated from gold using these methods, although
  the process is not perfect and requires further refinement.
