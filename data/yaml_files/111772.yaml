tldr: The author examines the development of striated muscular fibers in mammals,
  detailing the process of aggregation, elongation, and maturation of muscle cells.
  The study highlights the similarities between early muscle development in mammals
  and insects, as well as the role of cytoblasts and the surrounding blastema in the
  growth and differentiation of muscle fibers.
