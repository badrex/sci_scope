revised_title: Astronomical Observations and Instrumentation at St. Helena
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomical Instrumentation & Observations
tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, describes his astronomical observations made at
  St. Helena, focusing on the challenges he faced with the reflecting telescope and
  the sector instrument. He discovered the imperfection in the suspension of the plumb-line
  in the sector instrument, which affected the accuracy of the observations. Despite
  the setbacks, Maskelyne contributed to the improvement of astronomical instruments
  by identifying the issue with the suspension method.
