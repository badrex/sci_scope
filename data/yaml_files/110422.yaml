tldr: The author, George Fisher, deduces from his observations in high northern latitudes
  that the Aurora Borealis is developed mainly at the edge of the Frozen Sea or where
  there is a large accumulation of ice. He concludes that it is an electrical phenomenon
  caused by the positive electricity of the atmosphere, developed by the rapid condensation
  of vapor in the act of freezing, and the induced negative electricity of the surrounding
  atmosphere. The Aurora Borealis is the immediate consequence of the restoration
  of electrical equilibrium by the intervention of frozen particles, which become
  luminous while transmitting this electricity.
