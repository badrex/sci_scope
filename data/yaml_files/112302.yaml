scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the direct transformation of iodide of allyle into iodide
  of propyle by reacting it with hydriodic acid gas. The resulting compound is analyzed
  and found to correspond with the composition of iodide of propyle. Further experiments
  confirm the formation of propylic alcohol from the iodide.
