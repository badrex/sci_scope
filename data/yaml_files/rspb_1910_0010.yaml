revised_title: Contrasting Arrhenius' Theory on Agglutinin Absorption by Bacteria
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Immunology & Microbiology
tldr: This study investigates the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria and challenges
  Arrhenius' theory that the interaction between bacteria and agglutinin can be expressed
  by the formula C = kBn. The authors present experimental results that contradict
  Arrhenius' statements on various points, suggesting alternative explanations for
  the absorption process.
