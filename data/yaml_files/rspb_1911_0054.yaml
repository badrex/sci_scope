revised_title: The Discrimination of Monochromatic Regions in Color Perception
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Perception
tldr: The author investigates the perception of color and monochromatic regions, concluding
  that under controlled conditions, it is impossible to distinguish between the wavelengths
  within a monochromatic region. The study emphasizes the importance of considering
  irregularly dispersed light and physiological factors in color perception experiments.
