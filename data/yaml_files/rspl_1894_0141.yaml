revised_title: The Influence of Gravity on the Circulation and its Impact on Blood
  Pressure
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cardiology & Circulatory System
tldr: The author investigates the effects of gravity on the circulation of blood and
  how it influences blood pressure. The study reveals that the force of gravity is
  a significant factor in blood circulation, and the splanchnic vaso-motor mechanism
  compensates for the hydrostatic effects of gravity in changes of position. The research
  shows that the feet-down position has a more significant impact on blood pressure
  than the feet-up position, and the horizontal and feet-up positions can help restore
  blood pressure when the power of compensation is damaged.
