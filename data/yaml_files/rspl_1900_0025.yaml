revised_title: Investigating Lines of Induction in a Magnetic Field Using Fluid Dynamics
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Materials
tldr: The authors, Hele-Shaw and Hay, explore the similarities between fluid streamlines
  and magnetic induction lines by studying the flow of a viscous liquid between parallel
  plates. They establish a method to determine lines of induction in solid magnetic
  bodies and apply it to various magnetic problems, demonstrating its effectiveness
  and potential applications in electrical engineering.
