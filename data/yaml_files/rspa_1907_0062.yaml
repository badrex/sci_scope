revised_title: Experiments on Carbon at High Temperatures and Pressures
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of carbon at high temperatures and pressures,
  focusing on the formation of graphite and the challenges of melting carbon under
  pressure. The experiments reveal that graphite is the stable form of carbon after
  heating to high temperatures and that carbon vapor can permeate and diffuse into
  its cooler surroundings.
