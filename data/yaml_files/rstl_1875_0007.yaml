tldr: The author investigates the extinct species of gigantic land-tortoises in the
  Mascarene Islands, comparing them to the species still inhabiting the Galapagos
  Islands. The study reveals that the extinct tortoises had distinct features from
  the living ones, and that the Galapagos tortoises are indigenous to the archipelago.
  The author identifies five species of Galapagos tortoises, each inhabiting different
  islands of the group.
