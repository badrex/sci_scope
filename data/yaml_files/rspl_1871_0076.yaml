tldr: The study investigates the effects of alcohol and exercise on nitrogen elimination
  and body temperature. The results show that exercise slightly increases nitrogen
  elimination, while alcohol consumption has no significant impact. The findings support
  the idea that physical activity and moderate alcohol intake can be part of a healthy
  lifestyle.
