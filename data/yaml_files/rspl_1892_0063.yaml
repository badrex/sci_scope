  of Their Physiology and Function'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Ichthyology
tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of the air-bladder and Weberian
  ossicles in siluroid fishes. The authors discuss the physiology of these structures
  and their potential roles in various fish functions, such as audition and respiration.
  They also analyze the anatomical adaptations of these structures in relation to
  their functions and the limitations of their study due to the lack of experimental
  evidence.
