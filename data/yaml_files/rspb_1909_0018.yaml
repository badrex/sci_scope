revised_title: 'Ancestral Contributions in Heredity: A Critique of Mendelian Theory'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Genetics & Evolution
tldr: The author critiques the Mendelian theory of inheritance, arguing that experiments
  focusing on specific populations do not account for ancestral contributions to heredity.
  He demonstrates through mathematical models and examples that ancestry plays a significant
  role in the inheritance of traits, supporting the law of ancestral heredity.
