revised_title: 'Investigating the Failure of a Law in Photography: The Effect of Intensity
  and Exposure Time on Chemical Action'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Photochemistry & Photophysics
tldr: The author discovers that the commonly accepted law in photography, which states
  that equal amounts of chemical action are produced when the products of light intensity
  and exposure time are equal, fails under certain conditions. This failure is observed
  when using an amyl acetate lamp and exposures less than 1/1000 seconds, suggesting
  that the law may not hold true for all situations.
