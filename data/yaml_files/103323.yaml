  Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Soil Mechanics
tldr: This article describes the unusual event of three oak trees sinking into the
  ground in Manington, Norfolk. The author, Peter Le Neve, suggests that the cause
  may be related to the geological composition of the area, including the presence
  of quicksand and springs. The sinking of the trees is compared to a similar incident
  in Fleet Street, London, where the earth fell into a deep sewer.
