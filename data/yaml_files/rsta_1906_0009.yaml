revised_title: Determination of the Refractive Index of Gaseous Fluorine
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Analytical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive index of gaseous fluorine using various
  experimental setups and techniques. They find that the refractive index of fluorine
  is much lower than other elements and compounds, and that it is difficult to obtain
  fluorine in a state of absolute purity due to the presence of impurities.
