revised_title: 'Researches in Physical Astronomy: Lunar Theory and Precession of the
  Equinoxes'
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrodynamics
tldr: The author presents a new lunar theory that uses a different approach to Clairaut's
  method, involving the integration of differential equations with time as the independent
  variable. The paper also investigates the precession of the equinoxes, suggesting
  that it may be caused by the resistance of a medium, which could explain changes
  in Earth's climate and the eccentricity of comets.
