revised_title: An Analysis of Optical Dispersion's Actual Dependence on Physical Conditions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the influence of physical conditions, such as density,
  pressure, and temperature, on optical dispersion in transparent media. They propose
  a formula that accounts for these factors and provides a better understanding of
  the relationship between refractive index and physical conditions.
topics:
- Optical Dispersion
- Refractive Index
- Physical State
- Temperature Variation
- Pressure Variation
