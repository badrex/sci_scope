  Gases
scientific_discipline: Medicine & Health Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Medical Physiology & Pathology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of physical and chemical agents on blood,
  focusing on the mutual action of blood and respiratory gases. The research explores
  the influence of factors such as diffusion, motion, temperature, and various chemical
  substances on blood's ability to absorb oxygen and exhalate carbonic acid. The findings
  reveal the importance of certain conditions, like heat and age, on blood's chemical
  transformations and decompositions.
