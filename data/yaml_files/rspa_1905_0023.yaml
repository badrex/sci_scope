scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Materials Science
tldr: The author develops a new type of electric furnace that uses solid electrolytic
  conductors and a cascade arrangement to achieve high temperatures for various experiments.
  The furnace is tested by determining the melting point of platinum, demonstrating
  its effectiveness and potential for use in other physical investigations.
