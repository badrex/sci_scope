revised_title: 'The Relation between Refractivity and Density of Carbon Dioxide: A
  New Experiment'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between refractivity and density of
  carbon dioxide using a Fabry-Pérot interferometer. They find that the Lorenz and
  Lorentz formula is not accurate when applied to large density changes from gas to
  liquid, and suggest that continuous changes of density from gas to liquid can be
  produced by experimenting with carbon dioxide at temperatures close to its critical
  point.
