revised_title: Spectroscopic Analysis of Essential Oils and Hydrocarbons
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
tldr: The authors investigate the spectroscopic properties of various essential oils
  and hydrocarbons, finding that they transmit continuous spectra and exhibit different
  optical characteristics. They also observe that some substances, like australene
  and terebenthene, have slightly different absorption patterns and rotate polarized
  light in opposite directions.
