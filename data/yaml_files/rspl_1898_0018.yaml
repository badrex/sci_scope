revised_title: Investigation of Contact Electricity of Metals and its Dependence on
  Surface Conditions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrostatics
tldr: The author investigates the contact electricity of metals and its dependence
  on surface conditions, including the effects of solid non-conducting films, temperature
  variations, and liquid surface films. The study aims to understand and measure the
  changes in Volta contact electricity between conductors due to changes in the state
  of the surface of each conductor.
