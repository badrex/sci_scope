revised_title: A Study on Prepotentials and their Applications
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Applied Mathematics & Mathematical Physics
tldr: The author explores prepotentials, multiple integrals expressed in terms of
  disappearing variables and parameters, and their relationship to potential theory.
  The study covers various cases, including prepotential-plane, potential-plane, potential-surface,
  and potential-solid cases, and establishes distribution theorems for each case.
