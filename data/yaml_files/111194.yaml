  Earths'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry
tldr: 'The author investigates the decomposition of rubian and its products, focusing
  on the action of alkalies and alkaline earths. The study reveals five main products
  of decomposition: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine, rubiafine, and rubiagine. Additionally,
  the author discovers a fermentative substance in madder extracts, called erythrozym,
  which decomposes rubian and influences the formation of these products.'
