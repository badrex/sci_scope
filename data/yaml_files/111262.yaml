revised_title: Extension of the Base of Napier's Logarithms and Computation of Napierian
  Logarithms
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Computational Mathematics
tldr: The author extends the value of the base of Napier's logarithms and computes
  the Napierian logarithms of 2, 3, 5, and 10 to 205 decimal places. The results are
  presumed accurate, but no direct check or proof has been applied to the values.
