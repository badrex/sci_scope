revised_title: 'The Photographic Spectrum of Electrolytic Iron: An Extension of Thalen''s
  Researches'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Analytical Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the photographic arc spectrum of electrolytically deposited
  iron, supplementing Thalen's earlier research on the visible spectrum of iron. The
  author compares their findings with other studies by Kayser and Runge, McClean,
  and Rowland's solar spectrum. The research aims to determine the purity of the iron
  spectrum and identify impurities present in the iron used in other studies.
