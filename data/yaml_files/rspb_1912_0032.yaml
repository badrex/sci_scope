revised_title: 'Urease: A Selective Enzyme and Its Action on Urea'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Biochemistry & Enzymology
tldr: The authors investigate the enzyme urease, found in Soja beans, and its ability
  to catalyze the hydrolysis of urea. They discuss the complex process of urea formation
  and the role of electrolytes and non-electrolytes in accelerating the reaction.
  The study provides insight into the mechanism of enzyme action and the role of urease
  in breaking down urea in biological systems.

- Enzyme Action
- Urease
