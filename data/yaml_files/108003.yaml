tldr: John Herschel's observations of nebulae and star clusters made with a 20-foot
  reflector between 1825 and 1833 provide valuable insights into the nature and distribution
  of these celestial objects. His work expanded upon his father's previous observations
  and contributed to the understanding of the mysterious and diverse nature of nebulae
  and clusters visible in the northern hemisphere.
