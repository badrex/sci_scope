revised_title: Investigating the Effects of Temperature on Terrestrial Magnetic Forces
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Magnetic Fields
tldr: The author explores the effects of temperature on the intensity of magnetic
  forces and the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetic intensity using a compass
  and magnets in water. The study reveals that temperature variations can significantly
  impact the magnetic forces and their behavior.
