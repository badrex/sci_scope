scientific_subdiscipline: Pharmacology & Drug Discovery
tldr: This study investigates the pharmacological actions of organic oximides and
  their corresponding aldehydes, revealing that they possess similar properties to
  nitrites. The research explores the effects of these compounds on voluntary muscle,
  the spinal cord, and the cardiovascular system, highlighting their vasoconstrictive
  and vasodilative properties.
