revised_title: A Method for Detecting Unknown Inequalities in Terrestrial and Sun-Spot
  Observations
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The authors propose a method to detect unknown inequalities in solar physics,
  magnetism, and meteorology observations. They focus on the magnetic declination
  and its fluctuations, aiming to determine the exact periodical times of these inequalities
  and their properties.
topics:
- Solar Physics
- Magnetic Declination
- Meteorology
- Sunspots
- Periodic Inequalities
