revised_title: Synthesis of Succinic and Pyrotartaric Acids from Diatomic Alcohols
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Synthesis
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of succinic and pyrotartaric acids from
  diatomic alcohols, specifically ethylene and propylene. They describe the preparation
  and properties of cyanide of ethylene and propylene, and their reactions with potash
  to form the desired acids. The process provides a new method for creating complex
  organic compounds and expands the understanding of organic chemistry.
