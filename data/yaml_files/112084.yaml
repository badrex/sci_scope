revised_title: 'Fermat''s Theorem of Polygonal Numbers: A New Proof and Expansion'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Number Theory & Algebra
tldr: The author presents a new proof of Fermat's Theorem of Polygonal Numbers, demonstrating
  that every number can be composed of not exceeding three triangular numbers. The
  proof is based on the properties of triangular and square numbers, and the expansion
  of algebraic expressions into lines, squares, and cubes.
