revised_title: On the Connexion of Algebraic Functions with Automorphic Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics
scientific_subdiscipline: Analysis & Geometry
tldr: The paper explores the connection between algebraic functions and automorphic
  functions, demonstrating that the uniformization of algebraic forms can be achieved
  using automorphic functions of certain groups, specifically Fuchsian groups. The
  study also discusses the analytical relationship between the variables involved
  and the conformal representation problem.
