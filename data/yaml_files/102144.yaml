scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science & Meteorology
tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses the air's gravity and its varying weight in different times
  and places, suggesting that it may be due to the different mixtures of particles
  and the sun's influence on the atmosphere. He also explores the connection between
  atmospheric pressure and weather patterns.
