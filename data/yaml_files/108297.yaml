revised_title: Investigation of Bands in the Spectrum and Their Theoretical Explanation
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of dark bands appearing in a spectrum
  when a transparent plate is inserted into a fluid prism. The study explores the
  theoretical explanation of these bands and their relationship to interference and
  polarization, providing insights into the refractive indices and dispersion of various
  substances.
