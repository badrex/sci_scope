scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Numerical Analysis & Approximation Theory
tldr: The author presents a new method of approximation for evaluating elliptic and
  ultra-elliptic functions using arithmetic and harmonic means. The method involves
  finding successive means between two quantities and applying it to rational functions
  of x. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in approximating
  values of elliptic functions of the third kind.
