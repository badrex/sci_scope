revised_title: The Electrodynamic Nature of Muscular Contraction
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Physiology & Biophysics
tldr: The author discusses the nature of muscular contraction, exploring the possibility
  that mechanical work done by muscles is generated from chemical energy through the
  medium of electric forces. He examines the chemiodynamic and electrodynamic hypotheses,
  highlighting the limitations of the chemiodynamic hypothesis and the potential role
  of electricity in muscle contraction.
