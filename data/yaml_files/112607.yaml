revised_title: 'Condensation of Determinants: A New Method for Computing Arithmetical
  Values'
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory
tldr: The author introduces a new method called 'condensation' for computing the arithmetical
  values of determinants, which significantly reduces the time and complexity involved
  in solving simultaneous linear equations.
topics:
- Determinants
- Matrix Algebra
- Linear Equations
- Condensation Method
- Block Matrices
