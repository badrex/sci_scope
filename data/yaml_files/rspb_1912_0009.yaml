tldr: The author discovers a new species of parasitic flagellate, Herpetomonas pediculi,
  in the alimentary tract of the human body louse, Pediculus vestimenti. The flagellate
  exhibits three stages in its life cycle and is found primarily in the louse's oesophagus,
  proventriculus, mid-gut, and rectal portions of the gut. The parasite is not considered
  a threat to humans and is found to be harmless in its life cycle.
