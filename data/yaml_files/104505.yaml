scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Soil Science
tldr: A sudden sinking of the ground occurred at Horseford, Norfolk, leaving a 12-foot
  deep hole with no visible cracks or chasms. The author speculates on possible causes,
  such as subterranean currents washing away sandy matter, but cannot definitively
  explain the phenomenon. Additionally, a local farmer observed a mix of blue and
  white peas in his crop, suggesting cross-pollination.
