revised_title: Diurnal Deviations of the Horizontal Needle under Magnet Influence
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Magnetism & Electromagnetism
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie investigates the diurnal deviations of a horizontal needle
  under the influence of magnets. He describes a series of observations and experiments,
  and discusses the effects of temperature on the magnets' power. The study reveals
  that changes in temperature are not the only cause of variations in the points of
  equilibrium.
