revised_title: Cathode Ray Conversion of Diamond into Coke
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical and Optical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the conversion of diamond into coke using cathode rays
  in a high vacuum. They determine the temperature at which the conversion occurs
  and analyze the gas emissions during the process. The experiments reveal that the
  diamond disintegrates and increases in volume, resembling coke, with a temperature
  of 1890Â°C.
