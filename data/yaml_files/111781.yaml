revised_title: Effect of Mountain-Masses Attraction on Astronomical Latitude in Geodetic
  Surveys
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodesy
tldr: The author, George B. Airy, investigates the impact of mountain masses on the
  apparent astronomical latitude of stations in geodetic surveys. He proposes that
  the attraction of mountain masses disturbs the latitude due to the assumption that
  the Earth's crust floats on a dense fluid or semi-fluid (lava). This leads to a
  numerical calculation showing the tendency of the tableland to crack and sink in
  the middle.
