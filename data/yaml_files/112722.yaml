revised_title: On the Attraction Caused by Vibration
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Vibration
tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of approach caused by vibration, specifically
  between a vibrating tuning fork and a piece of cardboard. Through a series of experiments,
  it is concluded that the effect of apparent attraction is due to atmospheric pressure,
  and that this pressure is caused by undulatory dispersion.
