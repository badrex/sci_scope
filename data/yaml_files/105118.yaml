tldr: This article presents a case study of Anne Elizabeth Queriot, a woman whose
  bones were distorted and softened, causing severe pain and mobility issues. Despite

  revealed that her bones were extremely soft and that her body had undergone significant
  changes, including the dissolution of the reticular matter and the accumulation
  of a red thick matter in the bone cavities.
