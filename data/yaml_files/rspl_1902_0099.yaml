scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the correlation between homologous organs and their
  differentiation, proposing a method to correct for the influence of growth, environment,
  and local factors on the apparent homotypic correlation. The study focuses on the
  correlation between head length in pairs of brothers and the impact of age and growth
  on this correlation.
