revised_title: A Description of a Moving Bog in Ireland and its Possible Causes
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Soil Mechanics
tldr: A moving bog in Ireland was observed to move and cause significant changes to
  the surrounding landscape. The author, John Honohane, provides a detailed description
  of the event and suggests that the cause may be due to an unusually wet spring,
  which led to the bog's turf being undermined and subsequently sinking, causing the
  movement and changes in the landscape.
