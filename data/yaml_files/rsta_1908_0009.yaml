revised_title: Investigation of Liquid Surface-Tension Using Jet Vibration Method
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Surface Tension
tldr: The author investigates the surface tension of liquids using the jet vibration
  method, which involves measuring the wave length, velocity, and cross-section of
  a liquid jet executing transverse vibrations. This method provides a constant surface
  renewal and is useful for determining both the initial and stationary values of
  capillary tension.
