revised_title: 'The Gravitational Stability of the Earth: A Study of Elasticity and
  Earthquake Tremors'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: The author investigates the gravitational stability of the Earth by analyzing
  its elasticity and the behavior of earthquake tremors. They find that the Earth's
  present state is far from gravitational instability, with a seismic effective modulus
  of compression of approximately 10^11 dynes per square centimeter.
