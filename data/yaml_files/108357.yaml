revised_title: Experiments with an Extensive Water Battery and the Voltaic Circuit
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Electrochemistry Applications
tldr: The author constructs an extensive water battery with 3520 pairs of copper and
  zinc cells and investigates the electrical and chemical actions that occur before
  and after the completion of the voltaic circuit. The experiments demonstrate the
  possibility of obtaining a spark before the circuit is complete and the practicality
  of maintaining this action for several weeks.
