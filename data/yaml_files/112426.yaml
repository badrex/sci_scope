tldr: The author presents a simplified mathematical proof for the law of errors of
  observations, based on the hypothesis that errors arise from the joint operation
  of numerous independent sources. The proof demonstrates that the form of the error
  function resulting from the combination of an infinite number of infinitesimal errors
  is independent of the nature or laws of the component errors.
