revised_title: 'Further Observations on the Optical Phenomena of Crystals: The Boracic
  Acid Crystals'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the optical phenomena of boracic acid crystals, observing
  their unique circular crystalline structures and the colored cross patterns they
  exhibit when viewed under a polarizing microscope. The author also explores the
  chemical nature of these crystals and their various forms, as well as their ability
  to analyze polarized light, a property previously known only in tourmaline and a
  few other natural minerals.
