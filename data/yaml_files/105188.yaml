revised_title: Invention and Explanation of a Micrometer for Measuring Small Angles
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: John Dollond explains the design and function of a new micrometer for measuring
  small angles using a divided spherical lens. The instrument can be used in various
  configurations, including telescopes, and offers precise angle measurements by observing
  the separation of images formed by the two lens segments.
