revised_title: Intermittent Vision and the Role of Mechanical Shock on Perception
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Sensory Perception
tldr: The author investigates intermittent vision and finds that a slight mechanical
  shock, such as tapping the head or winking, can cause a periodic but rapidly extinguished
  paralysis of the perception of light. The study provides insight into the relationship
  between mechanical acceleration, neural sensitivity, and visual perception.
