revised_title: On the Geometric Properties of the Common Catenary
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Geometry & Trigonometry
tldr: The author investigates the properties of the common catenary curve and its
  relationship with parabolic trigonometry. He demonstrates various geometric properties
  and representations of the catenary curve, including the connection between the
  catenary and the parabolic or logarithmic plus, and the graphical representation
  of angles added together by the parabolic or logarithmic plus.
