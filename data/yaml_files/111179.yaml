scientific_subdiscipline: Botany & Plant Science
tldr: Arthur Henfrey investigates the anatomy of the stem of Victoria regia and finds
  that it has a monocotyledonous structure, similar to Nuphar lutea. The stem is an
  upright rhizome with no true woody fibers or cambium layer, and vascular bundles
  are arranged like those in monocotyledons such as palms.
