scientific_subdiscipline: Reproductive Biology & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the process of animal impregnation through a series
  of experiments on rabbits, focusing on the role of the ovaries and the formation
  of corpora lutea as evidence of impregnation. The study aims to determine the evidences
  of impregnation, the proximate cause of impregnation, and the form in which the
  rudiments of the fetus pass from the ovary to the uterus.
