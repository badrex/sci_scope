tldr: The author, Alexander Dalrymple, investigates the formation of low, flat islands
  in the ocean, specifically those in the South Sea. He explains that these islands
  are formed by coral banks, which grow into shoals and islands due to the accumulation
  of coral from the winds and waves. The author also describes the characteristics
  of these islands, such as their elongated shape, shallow waters, and the presence
  of vegetation and wildlife.
