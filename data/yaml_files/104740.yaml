scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Seismology
tldr: The author, Wm. Stukeley, examines the causes of earthquakes and challenges
  the notion that they are primarily caused by subterranean vapors, explosions, and
  fires. He argues that the extent and lack of visible effects of earthquakes contradict
  this hypothesis and suggests that a deeper understanding of springs and fountain
  systems is necessary to comprehend the true causes of these natural phenomena.
