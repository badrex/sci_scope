revised_title: Observations of the Magnetic Dip during Voyages of H.M.S. 'Iron Duke'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: The author, Sir Charles Shadwell, presents the results of a series of observations
  for the 'Magnetic Dip' taken during the voyages of H.M.S. 'Iron Duke' in the eastern
  seas, visiting China, Japan, and adjacent places in the years 1871-75. The observations
  provide data for determining the approximate values of the secular change of the
  magnetic dip and offer insights into the general direction of the isoclinal lines
  by graphic projection.
