scientific_subdiscipline: Veterinary Medicine & Animal Health
tldr: The author investigates the symptoms and treatment of a distemper affecting
  cows, concluding that it is primarily a peripneumony, or inflammation of the lungs,
  windpipe, and nostrils. The author recommends a treatment regimen involving bleeding,
  warm mash, and various herbal drenches. The cause of the distemper remains uncertain,
  but the author suggests that it may be contagious and recommends housing cows separately
  to prevent its spread.
