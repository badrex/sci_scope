revised_title: Experimental Investigations on the Effective Temperature of the Sun
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Astronomy & Astrophysics
tldr: The authors investigate the effective temperature of the Sun using a modified
  Meldometer and a differential radio-micrometer. They balance the heat from the Sun
  with an artificial source of heat at a known temperature, considering factors such
  as emissive power, reflecting power, and terrestrial atmospheric absorption. The
  study provides a more accurate estimation of the Sun's effective temperature.
