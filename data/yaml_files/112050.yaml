scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Isomerism
tldr: The author investigates the isomerism between the base produced by destructive
  distillation of cinchonine and lutidine from Dippel's oil. The study focuses on
  the physical and chemical properties, as well as the formation of platinum salts,
  of these two isomers, providing insights into their similarities and differences.
