scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Mineral Chemistry
tldr: Charles Hatchett analyzes a triple sulphuret ore from Cornwall, composed of
  lead, antimony, and copper, and provides a detailed description of its composition
  and properties. The ore's chemical makeup is similar to an antimony ore, and its
  constituent parts are lead, antimony, copper, and a small proportion of iron, combined
  with sulfur to form a triple sulphuret.
