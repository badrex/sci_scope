  Argument'

tldr: This paper examines the dentition and mandible of the extinct marsupial Thylacoleo
  Carnifex, challenging the argument for its herbivory. The author presents evidence
  from the structure and function of the teeth and mandible, comparing it to other
  marsupials and analyzing the work of the molar machinery in known herbivores. The
  study concludes that Thylacoleo Carnifex belongs to a distinct family of diprotodont
  marsupials and was likely a carnivorous species.
