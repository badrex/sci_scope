scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Kinetics
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the effects of rarefaction on flame and explosion,
  discovering that the combustion of various gases is influenced by the removal of
  atmospheric pressure. He also finds that the heat produced during combustion is
  largely independent of the flame's intensity.
