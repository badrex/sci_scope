revised_title: The Mechanism of Production of Prismatic Structure in Basalt
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Igneous Rocks
tldr: The author investigates the formation of prismatic structure in basalt and explains
  that it can be accounted for by the cooling and contraction of molten rock. The
  process involves the splitting of the rock into hexagonal prisms, with the diameter
  of each prism determined by the relation between the coefficient of contraction
  and extension at the splitting temperature.
