revised_title: 'On the Physical Properties of Ice and Glacier Motion: A Reevaluation
  of Canon Moseley''s Objections to Gravitation Theories'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Glaciology & Geophysics
tldr: The author examines the physical properties of ice and the motion of glaciers,
  addressing Canon Moseley's objections to gravitation theories. The study focuses
  on the resistance of ice to shearing and the influence of temperature on glacier
  movement, providing new experimental data to support the role of gravity in glacier
  motion.
topics:
- Glacier Motion
- Ice Physics
- Gravitation Theories
- Glacial Geology
- Ice Shearing Strength
