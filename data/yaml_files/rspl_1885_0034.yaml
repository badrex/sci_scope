revised_title: Investigating the Formation of Vortex Rings by Drops Falling into Liquids
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Dynamics & Rheology
tldr: The authors study the formation of vortex rings when drops fall into liquids,
  focusing on the role of viscosity and surface tension. They propose a theory that
  explains how the shape and properties of the liquid affect the formation of vortex
  rings, and present experimental results to support their findings.
