revised_title: Investigation of the Ionizing Power of Positive Ions from a Glowing
  Tantalum Filament in Helium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the ionizing power of positive ions from a glowing tantalum
  filament in helium gas using an ionization chamber and an electric field. They find
  that the minimum ionizing potential for positive ions is significantly higher than
  that for electrons.
