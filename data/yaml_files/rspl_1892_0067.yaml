revised_title: Improvements in Induction Machines for High Tension Electricity
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrical Engineering & Electronics
tldr: The author describes a multiple induction machine for producing high tension
  electricity and presents remarkable results obtained with it. The machine uses six
  induction coils in parallel with independent batteries, resulting in a higher output
  and overcoming the limitations of serial arrangements. The author also discusses
  the heating effects of the secondary current and the behavior of sparks and arcs
  in air gaps.
