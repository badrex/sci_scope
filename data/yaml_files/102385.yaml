tldr: The article describes the significant damage to the Isle of Portland in 1695/6,
  including the destruction of the Great Peer and the North-Peer, as well as the loss
  of work for many people. The cause is conjectured to be the result of a large amount
  of rubble falling onto a clay foundation weakened by rain, rather than an earthquake.
