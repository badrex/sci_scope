revised_title: Comparative Efficiency of Positively and Negatively Charged Ions as
  Condensation Nuclei
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Atmospheric Science
tldr: The author investigates the efficiency of positively and negatively charged
  ions as condensation nuclei and finds that negatively charged ions are much more
  effective in causing water to condense. This suggests that precipitation may carry
  a preponderance of negative electricity to the earth's surface.
