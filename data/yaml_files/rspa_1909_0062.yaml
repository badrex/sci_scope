tldr: This study investigates the liquidus curves and constitution of the ternary
  system of aluminium, copper, and tin alloys. The authors discuss the importance
  of understanding the properties of multi-component alloys and present their findings
  on the liquidus curves and freezing points of various compositions in this system.
