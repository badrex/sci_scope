revised_title: Observations on Stellar Heat and the Potential for Future Research
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Astrophysics & Space Science
tldr: The author, William Huggins, describes his observations of heat from stars using
  thermopiles and a sensitive galvanometer. He successfully detected heat from stars
  Sirius, Pollux, and Regulus, but could not make quantitative estimates of their
  calorific power. Huggins suggests that future research with larger telescopes could
  provide valuable information about the conditions of matter emitting light from
  different stars.
