scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geodynamics
tldr: The author investigates the displacement of the Earth's axis due to geological
  forces, specifically the effect of continents on the Earth's axis. Using mathematical
  formulas, the author calculates the displacement caused by each continent and the
  hypothetical effects of depressed continents occupying the sites of the present
  Pacific Ocean.
