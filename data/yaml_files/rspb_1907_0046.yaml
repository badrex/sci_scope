revised_title: Observations on the Life-history of Leucocytes - Part III
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Cell Biology & Genetics
tldr: The author investigates the life-history of leucocytes and observes the absorption
  of one leucocyte's nucleus by another, suggesting a process of fertilization. This
  phenomenon is observed in both Axolotl and mammalian spleen, with implications for
  understanding cell biology and the development of leucocytes.
