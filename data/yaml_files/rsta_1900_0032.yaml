  and Temperature Effects'
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Tectonics
tldr: This study investigates the flow and deformation of marble under various conditions
  of pressure and temperature, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind rock folding
  and contortion in the Earth's crust. The authors explore different methods of deformation
  and discuss the role of moisture in the process, comparing their findings with existing
  theories and experimental research.
topics:
- Rock Deformation
- Geological Processes
- Rock Flow
- Pressure and Temperature Effects
- Rock Folding
