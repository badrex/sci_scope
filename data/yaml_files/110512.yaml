scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Entomology & Insect Physiology
tldr: 'The author, George Newport, examines the respiration process in insects during
  their three life stages: larva, pupa, and imago. He investigates the tracheal system,
  spiracles, and respiratory muscles, as well as the role of nerves in respiration.
  Newport also studies the effects of submersion, confinement in unrespirable gases,
  and the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide in various insects.'
