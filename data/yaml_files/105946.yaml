tldr: John Howard conducts experiments to measure the heat of the waters at Bath and
  compares the temperatures of various springs in and around the area. He finds that
  the king's bath has the highest temperature, while the St. James' spring water has
  the lowest. The study also reveals differences in temperature between the old and
  new well houses at Bristol.
