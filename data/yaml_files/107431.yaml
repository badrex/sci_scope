revised_title: Polarization of Light by Oblique Transmission through All Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author, David Brewster, discovers that light transmitted obliquely through
  all transparent bodies, whether crystallized or uncrystallized, undergoes polarization.
  This phenomenon occurs similarly to the pencils formed by doubly refracting crystals.
  Brewster also establishes a relationship between the number of plates and the angle
  of incidence for polarizing light.
