revised_title: 'Experiments on the Absence of Mechanical Connection between Ether
  and Matter: A Summary'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments to determine if the velocity of
  light is affected by the presence of moving matter. Using various methods, including
  rotating steel disks, a massive iron lump, and an electrified disk, the author concludes
  that there is no significant mechanical connection between ether and matter, and
  that any motion between them must be irrotational in nature.
