revised_title: The Nuclear Model of the Atom and Its Implications
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: Sir Ernest Rutherford discusses the structure of the atom and proposes the nuclear
  model, in which a dense, positively charged nucleus is surrounded by negatively
  charged electrons. This model explains the scattering of alpha particles and provides
  insights into atomic properties and radioactivity.
