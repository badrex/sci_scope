revised_title: 'Flame Spectra at High Temperatures: The Spectrum of Metallic Manganese
  and Its Compounds'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Materials
tldr: The author investigates the flame spectra of high-temperature alloys and compounds
  containing manganese, finding that manganese alloys yield a more distinctive spectrum
  than compounds with the same proportion of manganese. The study compares the spectra
  of metallic manganese, manganese oxide, and other manganese-containing materials,
  providing insights into the chemical properties of manganese at high temperatures.
