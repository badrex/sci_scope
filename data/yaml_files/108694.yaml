  and Dimorphodon'

scientific_subdiscipline: Evolutionary Biology & Paleontology
tldr: The author examines the vertebral characters of the Pterosauria order, specifically
  Pterodactylus and Dimorphodon, and finds that their cervical and dorso-lumbar vertebrae
  exhibit the earliest known instance of the 'procoelian' type, which is now prevalent
  in the reptilian class. This discovery sheds light on the evolution and adaptation
  of these ancient flying reptiles.
