revised_title: Microscopic Analysis of Brain and Egg Molecules after Freezing
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Cell Biology
tldr: The author examines the effects of freezing on brain and egg molecules, using
  microscopy to compare their structures before and after freezing. The study reveals
  significant differences in the brain's structure after freezing, suggesting that
  animals with frozen brains cannot be revived.
