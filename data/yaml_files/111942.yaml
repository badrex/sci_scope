revised_title: Investigation of Gold-Tin Alloys and Their Crystalline Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Metallurgy
tldr: The authors study the formation of crystals in gold-tin alloys and observe that
  well-defined crystals are present in alloys containing between 43% to 27.4% gold.
  They also note that the composition of crystals and mother-liquor are never the
  same, and that the addition of more tin does not cause further separation into two
  masses.
