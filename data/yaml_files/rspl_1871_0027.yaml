revised_title: Magnetic Observations at Bombay and the Effects of Height on Magnetic
  Action
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geophysics & Geomagnetism
tldr: Charles Chambers presents magnetic observations taken at the Colaba Observatory
  in Bombay from 1867 to 1870. He discusses the absolute direction and intensity of
  Earth's magnetic force, as well as its secular and annual variations. The study
  also reveals a diminution of terrestrial magnetic action with an increase in height.
