revised_title: 'Spectrum of Cadmium in Inactive Gases: Observations on the Effect
  of Pressure and Electric Discharge'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Spectrochemistry
tldr: The authors investigate the spectrum of cadmium in various inactive gases, such
  as helium, neon, argon, and xenon, under different pressures and electric discharges.
  They observe that the intensity and visibility of the cadmium lines vary depending
  on the gas type and pressure, with some lines being absent or appearing only under
  specific conditions.
