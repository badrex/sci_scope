revised_title: Vortex Ring Vibrations and Interactions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics
tldr: The authors investigate the vibrations of a vortex ring and the interactions
  between two vortex rings. They find that the direction of motion of a vortex is
  deflected towards the other vortex, and the radius and energy of each vortex are
  affected by their interaction.
