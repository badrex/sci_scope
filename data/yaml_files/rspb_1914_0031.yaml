  of Miss Wheldale''s Hypothesis'
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biochemistry & Physiology
tldr: The author investigates the production of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins in
  plants, challenging Miss Wheldale's hypothesis that anthocyan pigments are closely
  related to flavone and flavonol glucosides. The study demonstrates that anthocyan
  pigments are produced by reduction of flavone or flavonol derivatives, rather than
  oxidation, and that anthocyanins can be directly produced from yellow glucosides
  without intermediate formation of anthocyanidins.
