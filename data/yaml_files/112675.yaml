tldr: This paper by Prof. Cayley explores the properties of curves that satisfy given
  conditions, focusing on curves of a determinate order and conics. The author discusses
  the theories of Chasles, Zeuthen, and De Jonquieres, and introduces the concept
  of quasi-geometrical representation of conditions using loci in hyper-space. A separate
  memoir will cover the application of the Principle of Correspondence to this topic.
