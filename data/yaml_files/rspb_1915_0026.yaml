revised_title: The Transmission of Infra-Red Rays by the Media of the Eye and the
  Transmission of Radiant Energy by Crookes and Other Glasses
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: This study investigates the transmission of infra-red rays through the eye's
  media and the transmission of radiant energy through Crookes and other glasses.
  The authors found that the lens and other eye components absorb and transmit infra-red
  rays differently, and that carbon tetrachloride is a suitable fluid for neutralizing
  the lens's refractive properties during experiments.
