revised_title: Thermo-Dynamic Properties of Solids and the Effects of Heat on Wood
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermodynamics & Calorimetry
tldr: Joule examines the effects of heat on the expansion of solids, particularly
  wood, and the influence of tension and moisture. He finds that when wood is saturated
  with water, its expansibility by heat ceases, and it contracts in each direction
  with a rise in temperature. Joule infers that this contraction is due to heat reducing
  the force of capillary attraction, allowing the walls of the wood's cells to be
  partially relieved from the force pushing them apart.
