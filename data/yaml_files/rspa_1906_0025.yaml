revised_title: The Effect of Tensile Overstrain on the Compression Yield-Point of
  Iron
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Engineering
tldr: The author investigates the effect of tensile overstrain on the compression
  yield-point of iron, finding that the yield-point increases with each step of overstrain
  and recovery, ultimately affecting the material's behavior in compression.
