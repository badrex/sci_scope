revised_title: The Ratio of Luminous and Non-Luminous Radiation Emitted by a Gas Flame
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Thermal Physics & Energy
tldr: The authors investigate the amount of luminous and non-luminous radiation emitted
  by a gas flame and determine the ratio of light to total radiation. They find that
  the efficiency of an Argand gas flame is approximately 2%, with the majority of
  energy emitted as non-luminous radiation.

- Gas Flame Radiation
- Thermal Radiation
- Heat and Light Emission
- Thermodynamics
- Energy Efficiency
