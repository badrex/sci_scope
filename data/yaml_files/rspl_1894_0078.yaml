revised_title: The Influence of Natural Agents on the Virulence of the Tubercle-Bacillus
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of air and light exposure on the virulence
  of the tubercle-bacillus using rabbit and guinea pig experiments. They find that
  exposure to air and light can reduce the virulence of the bacillus, suggesting that
  these factors may play a role in disinfecting the bacteria.
