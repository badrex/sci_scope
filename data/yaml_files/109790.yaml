revised_title: Decomposition of Fluoric Compounds and Fluorine's Chemical Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Chemical Analysis
tldr: Sir Humphry Davy investigates the decomposition of fluoric compounds and the
  properties of fluorine. He examines the reactions of fluoric compounds with various
  substances, such as ammonia and chlorine, and discusses the composition of fluor
  spar and the possibility of oxygen in chlorine. Davy concludes that fluorine is
  an element and challenges the notion that oxygen is the principle of acidity.
