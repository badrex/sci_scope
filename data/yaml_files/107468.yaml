scientific_subdiscipline: Hematology & Blood Disorders
tldr: The author investigates the changes in blood during coagulation and the role
  of carbonic acid gas in forming channels within the coagulated blood. The study
  includes experiments with blood samples and microscopes, as well as observations
  of blood coagulation in living animals. The findings suggest that the channels in
  coagulated blood are formed by the extrication of carbonic acid gas.
