revised_title: Investigating Atmospheric Refraction and Double Images
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The author investigates the causes of double images caused by atmospheric refraction
  and proposes a theory based on the variation of density in the atmosphere. The theory
  is supported by experiments with different fluids, demonstrating the relationship
  between density variations and refraction.
