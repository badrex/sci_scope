revised_title: 'The Emission and Transmission of Röntgen Rays: A Study of the Relation
  between Atomic Weight and Radiation Intensity'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Nuclear Physics
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between atomic weight and the intensity
  of emitted and transmitted Röntgen rays using an ionization method. The authors
  found that heavier metals produce more intense Röntgen rays and that there is a
  correlation between atomic weight and radiation intensity.
topics:
- Röntgen Rays
- Atomic Weight
- Ionization
- Selective Absorption
- Radiation Intensity
