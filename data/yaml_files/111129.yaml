revised_title: On the Decomposition of Rubian and Its Products
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Organic Chemistry & Natural Dyes
tldr: 'The author investigates the decomposition of rubian, a substance found in madder,
  and identifies five products of its decomposition: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine,
  rubianine, and a sugar. The study provides insight into the chemical processes involved
  in the formation of color in madder extracts and could potentially have significant
  implications for the textile industry.'
