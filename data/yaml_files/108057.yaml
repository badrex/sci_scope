revised_title: On the Continued Theory of the Moon
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Lunar Dynamics
tldr: The author, John William Lubbock, investigates the lunar theory by analyzing
  the differential equations and astronomical observations. He compares the results
  of M. Damoiseau and M. Plana and proposes a new method to determine the coefficients
  of the inequalities and the arbitrary quantities m, e, and y. The author also discusses
  the development of the radius vector and the elliptic expression for the coordinates
  of the sun and moon in the disturbing function.
