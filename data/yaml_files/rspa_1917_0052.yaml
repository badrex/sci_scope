revised_title: 'Characteristic Frequency and Atomic Number: A Study of the Relationship
  between Atomic Frequency and Atomic Number in Elements'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the characteristic frequency
  and atomic number in elements, finding that the characteristic frequency is a function
  of the atomic number and is independent of the atomic weight. They also discuss
  the application of the Debye formula to calculate the atomic frequency and the probability
  of the observed results being accidental.
topics:
- Atomic Frequency
- Atomic Number
- Specific Heat
- Quantum Theory
- Elastic Constants
