revised_title: 'Achromatic Telescope with Fluid Concave Lens: An Experiment and Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: Peter Barlow investigates the possibility of constructing an achromatic telescope
  using a fluid concave lens instead of flint glass. He successfully creates a smaller
  telescope with improved optical performance and suggests further experiments to
  optimize the design.
