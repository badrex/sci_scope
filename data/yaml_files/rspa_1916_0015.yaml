revised_title: Investigation of Single-Line Spectra and Ionizing Potentials of Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Atomic & Molecular Physics
tldr: The author investigates the single-line spectra of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium,
  and their ionizing potentials. They find that the single-line spectra can be obtained
  when electrons possess energy within a specific range, and the ionizing potential
  can be calculated using the frequency of the single spectral line.
