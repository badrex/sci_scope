scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Neurophysiology
tldr: The author discusses the effects of electrotonns and currents on spinal centres,
  exploring the role of anode stimulation in counteracting inhibitory effects. They
  also examine the restoration of activity through current passage and the potential
  influence of katelectrotonus.
