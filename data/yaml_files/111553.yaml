tldr: The author investigates the quantity of carbonic acid expired, air inspired,
  and the rate of respiration in various individuals throughout the day, during different
  seasons, and under different conditions of exertion. The study reveals significant
  variations in respiratory phenomena due to factors such as temperature, food intake,
  and atmospheric pressure.
