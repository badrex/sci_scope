revised_title: Effects of a Strong Magnetic Field on Electric Discharges in Vacuo
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The author investigates the effects of a strong magnetic field on electric discharges
  in a Crookes tube. They observe that the magnetic field alters the appearance of
  the discharge, causing a shift from green fluorescence to blue luminescence, and
  significantly reduces the internal resistance of the tube. The phenomenon occurs
  regardless of the magnet's polarity and reverts to its original state when the magnetic
  field is removed.
