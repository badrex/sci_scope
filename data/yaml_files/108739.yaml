scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author explores the method of symmetric products and its applications to
  the solution of higher equations, focusing on the quintic equation. They introduce
  a new cyclical symbol to simplify calculations and discuss circular functions in
  the context of the general theory.
