  Iodide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Materials Science & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: This study investigates the anomalous expansion by heat of iodide of silver
  and iodide of copper, as well as the properties of five alloys of these iodides.
  The coefficients of contraction and expansion are determined, and the alloys' physical
  properties, such as melting points and specific gravities, are analyzed. The results
  reveal interesting facts about the behavior of these materials when heated and their
  interactions with other substances.
