revised_title: An Investigation into the Electrical Properties and Anatomy of the
  Torpedo
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Zoology
tldr: The author conducts a series of experiments on the torpedo fish to understand
  its electrical properties and the anatomy of its electrical organs. The findings
  confirm the similarities between the fish's electricity and voltaic electricity,
  and reveal the role of the electrical organs in the fish's anatomy and physiology.
