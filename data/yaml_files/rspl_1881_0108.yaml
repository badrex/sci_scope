revised_title: The Influence of Stress and Strain on the Action of Physical Forces
  in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Solid State Physics & Materials Science
tldr: The author investigates the effects of stress and strain on the electrical conductivity
  of various metals, discovering that temporary alterations in resistance can be produced
  by longitudinal traction. The study also reveals that the specific resistances of
  most substances increase with temporary longitudinal stress, while some, like nickel
  and aluminum, show a decrease in specific resistance under certain conditions.
