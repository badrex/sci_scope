revised_title: On the Acoustic Shadow of a Sphere and Legendre's Functions
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Acoustics & Wave Propagation
tldr: The author investigates the acoustic shadow of a sphere and its effect on sound
  wave propagation. The study involves the use of Legendre's functions and provides
  insights into the intensity of sound waves in different directions around a spherical
  obstacle.
