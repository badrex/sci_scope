revised_title: The Impact of X-Rays on Chick Embryo Development
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Developmental Biology & Embryology
tldr: This study investigates the effects of X-ray exposure on chick embryo development.
  The research found that X-rays cause a progressive diminution in mitotic activity,
  leading to halted development in the exposed embryos. The findings contradict previous
  studies on plant growth, suggesting that the initial stimulatory effect of X-rays
  may be brief or absent in chick embryos.
