scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Zoology & Animal Physiology
tldr: The author describes an experiment in which boiled mackerel fish emit light
  when the water they are in is stirred. The luminosity is observed to be strongest
  when the fish are alive and not yet decomposing, suggesting a biological source
  of the light.
