revised_title: The Refractive Index and Dispersion of Light in Argon and Helium
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: The authors investigate the refractive index and dispersion of light in argon
  and helium using an interferometer. They determine the absolute value of the refractive
  index for various wavelengths and provide a detailed analysis of the experimental
  setup and results.
