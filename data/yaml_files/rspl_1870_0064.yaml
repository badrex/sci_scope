revised_title: The Formation and Properties of Salts of Nitrous Oxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Inorganic Chemistry & Compounds
tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of salts of nitrous oxide,
  discovering a new salt that can be precipitated from nitrate solutions. The salt
  is stable, insoluble in water, and can be decomposed by heat, producing nitric oxide,
  metallic silver, and silver nitrate.
