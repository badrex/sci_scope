revised_title: The Influence of Auximones on the Growth of Lemna minor in Mineral
  Culture Solutions
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Plant Biology & Ecology
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of organic growth-promoting substances (auximones)
  on the growth of Lemna minor in mineral culture solutions. They find that the presence
  of auximones significantly increases the growth and vigor of the plants, while control
  plants show signs of starvation and decreased growth.
