  and Other Earths'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Spectroscopy & Materials Chemistry
tldr: The author investigates phosphorescent spectra in high vacua, focusing on alumina
  and other earths. He discovers that the phosphorescence of alumina is due to the
  molecular discharge and that the emitted light is discontinuous, with a strong red
  line characteristic of this form of alumina. The study also reveals that other earths,
  such as glucina and zirconia, exhibit phosphorescent properties, but with different
  colors and spectra.
