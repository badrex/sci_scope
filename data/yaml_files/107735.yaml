revised_title: A General Method for Calculating Crystal Angles and Laws of Formation
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Crystallography & Solid State Chemistry
tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the angles made by any planes of
  crystals and determining the laws according to which they are formed. The method
  uses a combination of geometric and algebraic techniques, allowing for the calculation
  of angles and the identification of co-existent planes in crystalline structures.
