revised_title: A Critique on the Equation of Time Calculation Method
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Celestial Mechanics & Astrometry
tldr: The author critiques the method of computing the equation of time used in the
  Connoissance des Mouvements Celestes, arguing that the equation of the equinoxes
  should not be taken into account. He provides an alternative method for calculating
  the equation of time based on the sun's right ascension and the nutation of the
  Earth's axis.
