scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Algebra & Number Theory
tldr: The author, Davies Gilbert, discusses the nature of negative and imaginary quantities,
  arguing that they are creations of arbitrary definitions and that their properties
  are interchangeable with real quantities. He uses symbolic notation to illustrate
  his points and provides examples from logarithmic formulas and series expressing
  circular arcs.
