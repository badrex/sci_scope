revised_title: The Lymphatic Heart of the Eel and its Influence on Blood Flow
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Anatomy & Physiology
tldr: This paper investigates the function of the caudal heart in eels, revealing
  it to be a lymphatic heart rather than a blood heart. The study shows that the force
  of the lymph-stream from the caudal heart accelerates and promotes the flow of blood
  in the caudal vein, contributing to the overall circulation within the eel.
