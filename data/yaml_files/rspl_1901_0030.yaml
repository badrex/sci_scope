revised_title: Magnetized Electrodes and Electrical Discharge Phenomena in Rarefied
  Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Plasma Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of magnetized electrodes on electrical discharge
  phenomena in rarefied gases. They discover that the rate of change of the magnetic
  lines plays a crucial role in the formation of a luminous ring and the loss of positive
  electrification from charged bodies in a magnetic field.
