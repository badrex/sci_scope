revised_title: On the Diffraction of Light by Spheres with Small Relative Index
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Electromagnetism
tldr: The author investigates the diffraction of light by spheres with a small relative
  index of refraction and derives formulas for the scattered electric displacements.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of light in suspensions and the transmission
  of light through media containing small particles.
