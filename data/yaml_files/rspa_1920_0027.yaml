revised_title: Investigating the Pressure Distribution on Shell Heads Moving at High
  Velocities
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Aerospace & Aeronautical Engineering
tldr: The authors use a service time-fuze as a manometer to determine the pressure
  under which the powder is burning in a shell moving at high velocities. They analyze
  the pressure distribution on the shell head and discuss the implications for understanding
  the resistance of a compressible fluid at high velocities.
