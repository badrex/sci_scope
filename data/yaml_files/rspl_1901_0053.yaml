revised_title: A New Yeast Species with Conjugation and Spore Formation
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Microbiology & Microbial Genetics
tldr: The author discovers a new yeast species that conjugates and forms spores, which
  they propose to place in a new genus, Saccharomyces, due to its unique spore-formation
  process. The conjugation process involves the fusion of two yeast cells through
  beak-like structures, resulting in compound cells that can produce spores.
