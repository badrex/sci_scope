revised_title: Correction of an Error in Dr. Haughton's Paper on Physical Geology
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Geology & Geophysics
tldr: The author corrects an error in his previous paper on physical geology, adjusting
  the angular velocity of cycloidal wobble and providing a new estimate for the time
  it takes for the wobble to complete a cycle. Additionally, the author discusses
  the specific inductive capacities of certain dielectrics and presents a table of
  experimental results.
