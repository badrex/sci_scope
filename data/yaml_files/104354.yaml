tldr: The author presents a case of a gentleman who experienced a severe urinary irritation
  due to the discharge of fine capillamenta (hair-like substances) along with his
  urine. Despite various treatments, the condition improved only after the extraneous
  substances were removed. The author discusses the possibility of these capillamenta
  being the tegument of an animal that entered the urinary passages and passed through
  the lacteals and renal glands.
