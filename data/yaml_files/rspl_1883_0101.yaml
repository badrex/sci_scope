revised_title: A New Method of Generating Electricity Using Hydrogen and Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Energy Conversion
tldr: The author investigates a new method of generating electricity by using hydrogen
  and various metals as a medium. The experiments reveal that certain metals can transmit
  hydrogen at a red heat, leading to the production of electricity. The author also
  discovers that vitreous materials like glass and porcelain can act as media for
  this process, allowing for the use of other metals in the experiments.
