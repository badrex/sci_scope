tldr: Dr. Robert Whytt reports on an earthquake experienced in Glasgow and Dumbarton,
  as well as a shower of dust that fell on a ship between Shetland and Iceland. The
  earthquake occurred on the night of December 30th to 31st, with three successive
  shocks felt by many residents. The shower of dust, likely caused by the eruption
  of Iceland's Hecla mountain, occurred in October and covered the ship's decks, tops,
  and sails.
