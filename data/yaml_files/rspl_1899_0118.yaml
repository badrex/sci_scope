revised_title: The Role of Vascular and Visceral Factors in Emotion
scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neuroscience & Behavior
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between vascular and visceral factors
  and the genesis of emotion through experiments on dogs with severed cervical spinal
  cords. The results show that emotional responses remain intact despite the disconnection
  from thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic viscera, suggesting that the psychological
  process of emotion is not solely dependent on these factors.
