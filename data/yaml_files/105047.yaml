revised_title: Odour Transmission through Electrified Globes and Tubes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Electrochemistry & Chemical Reactions
tldr: The author describes experiments conducted by Professor Winkler, who discovered
  that certain odors could pass through electrified glass globes and tubes. The experiments
  involved placing odoriferous substances in the globes and tubes and then electrifying
  them, resulting in the odors being transmitted to significant distances. The author
  also discusses the results of similar experiments conducted in London and the transmission
  of odors through a chain connected to the electrified globe.
