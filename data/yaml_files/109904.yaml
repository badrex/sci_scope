revised_title: General Law of Double Refraction and Polarization in Regularly Crystallized
  Bodies
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Optics & Light
tldr: David Brewster investigates the laws of polarization and double refraction in
  regularly crystallized bodies, discovering a general principle that explains complex
  optical phenomena. This principle is based on the principles of mechanics and allows
  for accurate calculations of the tints and phenomena of double refraction.
