revised_title: 'The Discharge of Gases under High Pressures: Experimental Study of
  Nozzle Geometry'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Chemical Physics
tldr: The authors investigate the discharge of gases under high pressures using various
  nozzle geometries and find that the flow rate remains constant despite variations
  in pressure. They also observe that the steadiness of the flow is influenced by
  the design of the nozzle and the temperature of the air passing through it.
