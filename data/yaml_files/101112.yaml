revised_title: Observations of Saturn and the Predicted Return of its Ring
scientific_discipline: Astronomy
scientific_subdiscipline: Planetary Science
tldr: In a letter to the publisher, Christian Hugens de Zulichem discusses his observations
  of Saturn and predicts the return of its ring. He explains that the ring's disappearance
  is due to the angle of sunlight illuminating its flat surface, and this year's observations
  allow for a more accurate prediction of the ring's return.
