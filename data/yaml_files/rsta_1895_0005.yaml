revised_title: Improvements in Measuring Thermal Conductivity of Metals
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors present a new method for determining the thermal conductivity of
  metals, which is simpler, faster, and requires less material than previous methods.
  They apply this method to copper, silver, gold, and platinum, and discuss potential
  sources of error in their experiments.
topics:
- Thermal Conductivity
- Metals
- Heat Transfer
- Experimental Techniques
- Error Analysis
