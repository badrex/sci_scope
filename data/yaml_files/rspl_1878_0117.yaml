revised_title: Inequalities of the Diurnal Range of the Declination Magnet and Experiments
  on Metallic Reflexion
scientific_discipline: Physics
scientific_subdiscipline: Electromagnetism & Optics
tldr: The authors investigate the inequalities of the diurnal range of the declination
  magnet at Kew Observatory and find evidence of an inequality with a period of 24.00
  days. They also discuss experiments on metallic reflection and the effects of different
  media on the principal incidence and principal azimuth of reflected light.
