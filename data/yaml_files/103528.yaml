revised_title: Further Analysis of a Frictionless Machine
scientific_discipline: Engineering & Technology
scientific_subdiscipline: Mechanical Engineering & Machines
tldr: The author examines a machine claimed to be without friction and demonstrates
  the loss of power when using an inclined plane. The study shows that the power-to-weight
  ratio decreases as the angle of inclination increases, and provides a formula for
  calculating the loss of power in any given inclination.
