revised_title: 'The Effect of Hydrogen on the Discharge of Negative Electricity from
  Hot Platinum: A Reassessment'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry
scientific_subdiscipline: Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry
tldr: This study investigates the effect of hydrogen on the discharge of negative
  electricity from hot platinum. The author finds that hydrogen significantly increases
  the negative leak, and the discharge's behavior changes with prolonged exposure
  to hydrogen. The findings suggest that hydrogen alters the state of the platinum,
  affecting the discharge even after the removal of hydrogen.
