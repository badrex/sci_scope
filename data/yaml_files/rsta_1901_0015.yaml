revised_title: On the Theory of Consistence of Logical Class-Frequencies and its Geometrical
  Representation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics & Statistics
scientific_subdiscipline: Statistics & Probability
tldr: The author presents a theory of consistence for logical class-frequencies and
  their geometrical representation, expanding on previous work by De Morgan and Boole.
  The study focuses on deriving conditions for self-consistent frequencies and discusses
  the limitations of inference based on given data.
