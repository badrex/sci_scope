scientific_discipline: Biology & Life Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Neurobiology & Vision Science
tldr: The author conducts experiments on ocular spectra, observing the activity of
  the retina and its role in vision. The study reveals that the retina is in an active
  state during ocular spectra, suggesting that all vision is due to the activity of
  this organ.
