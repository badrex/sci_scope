tldr: Sir William de W. Abney modifies his color patch apparatus to produce two spectra
  with the same beam, enabling precise color matching and redetermination of visual
  sensation curves. The study refines the inherent white content in green colors and
  the blue sensation in the yellow and green spectrum. The research also introduces
  a table for determining the dominant wavelength and white content of mixed colors,
  with applications in color sensitometry for photography.
