tldr: William Herschel discovers invisible rays from the sun that have a heating effect
  but do not produce illumination. These rays, which he names "radiant heat," have
  a greater range of refrangibility than visible light. He concludes that the sun's
  invisible rays far exceed visible ones in number and that they have a range of refrangibility
  beyond the prismatic spectrum.
