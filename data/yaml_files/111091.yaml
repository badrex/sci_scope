revised_title: Investigating the Accuracy of Glaisher's Hygrometrical Tables and the
  Relation of Air and Evaporation Temperatures to the Dew-Point
scientific_discipline: Environmental & Earth Sciences
scientific_subdiscipline: Meteorology & Climatology
tldr: The author compares the accuracy of Glaisher's Hygrometrical Tables with the
  use of wet and dry-bulb thermometers, concluding that the tables are highly accurate
  and providing additional evidence for the value of Greenwich Hygrometrical Observations.
