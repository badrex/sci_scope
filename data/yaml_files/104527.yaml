tldr: Charles Bonnet conducted experiments to determine the effects of planting seeds
  in moss instead of soil. He found that grains sown in moss matured later but produced
  taller stems, more blades, and a more abundant harvest. Additionally, various flowers
  and cuttings grew well in moss, suggesting its potential as a viable planting medium.
